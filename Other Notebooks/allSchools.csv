Florida State University,28-Feb-2020,"Dear FSU Family,

Florida State University continues to closely monitor advisories and updates from the Centers for Disease Control concerning the COVID-19 coronavirus that has spread to many countries.

The safety of our students, faculty and staff is our paramount concern. As we head into spring break and many people are on the move, I want to update you on actions the university is taking to protect our campus community.

FSU has suspended travel to China and South Korea, where the warning level has been set by the CDC at Level 3. Travelers are not authorized to travel to these nations until further notice.

Heightened levels of alert also exist for Japan, Iran and Italy, which currently are at Level 2. We have suspended university related faculty and staff travel to those countries, as well, without approval of your divisions vice president. If you do visit any countries with the above warning levels or any affected area we strongly encourage you to self-isolate for a quarantine period of 14 days when you return.

In an abundance of caution, FSU canceled classes at its Florence Study Center for the week. We have not closed our residences in Florence in case some students want to remain in place during that programs spring break. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Italy, and around the globe. Information regarding all summer programs will be updated by the end of March.

We also have identified and contacted FSU students in the affected countries who are traveling as exchange students, as well as faculty or staff who were traveling on FSU business, to assist them. Please contact the university as soon as possible if you require assistance and have not yet been contacted.

No cases of the virus have been reported at FSU or confirmed in the state of Florida, and the risk is considered low, but the university is being proactive. FSU is coordinating with the Leon County Health Department and the Florida Department of Health to review protocols in preparation for the possibility of a case here.

For now, I encourage you to do your part to protect yourself and others. There is no vaccine at this time to prevent the virus and no specific treatment that is recommended. The CDC advises that the best thing to do is avoid being exposed and stay healthy by taking everyday actions against respiratory illness such as washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and getting a flu shot. Additional health information is provided on the FSU Alert page. (alerts.fsu.edu)

Most importantly, if you have a respiratory illness or fever, please stay home. We will work with the deans and faculty to accommodate students who are ill, and we urge sick faculty and staff to work with your dean, department head or supervisor to coordinate coverage of your responsibilities.

For faculty and staff matters related to this issue, please contact Tracey Pearson (staff) at 850-644-3694 or Rebecca Peterson (faculty) at 850-645-2202, both in the Office of Human Resources.

Students at our Florida campuses can contact the University Health Services (UHS) Administrative Office at 850-645-0620.

If you are an FSU student currently enrolled in one of our study abroad programs, please contact the Office of International Programs with any questions or concerns.

As the spread of the coronavirus continues to develop, more countries are likely to be added to the list of those to avoid. Please consult the FSU Alert website for regular updates in the coming days and keep yourself informed about this important health issue. There are multiple links provided on the site with helpful information, or visit:  www.cdc.gov .

Florida State University,3-Mar-2020,"Florida State University is taking aggressive steps to prevent the spread of disease, such as COVID-19, by promoting healthy habits and enhancing its existing cleaning and disinfection practices.

This cannot be achieved without the help of the entire campus community. First and foremost, this means engaging in healthy habits such as washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds; covering your cough or sneeze; avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth; avoiding those who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Signage promoting this is posted throughout campus.

University partners including Facilities, Recreation, Housing, and others have reviewed cleaning protocols and products and are taking extra measures to disinfect frequently touched areas like doorknobs, stair rails, elevator buttons and other surfaces (such as exercise equipment and classroom AV equipment). High traffic areas such as student housing, libraries, dining halls, bathrooms, locker rooms, as well as recreation centers also receive more cleanings. Additionally, Star Metro buses are cleaned daily and being deep cleaned weekly.

There is no vaccine to prevent this virus, and the CDC advises that the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Here are everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
If you have a respiratory illness or fever, please stay home. University administrators will work with the deans and faculty to accommodate students who are ill, and sick faculty and staff are urged to work with their dean, department head or supervisor to coordinate coverage of your responsibilities.

If you have spent time in an area with an alert in place, you will need to monitor your symptoms when you return. If during the past 14 days you feel sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing, please do the following

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctors office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to an area with community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others and do not travel while sick.
Avoid using public transportation if possible. University Health Services offers courtesy transportation to and from the University Health Center for students on the main campus only (main campus students may call the Medical Response Unit at 850-644-3349 to request courtesy",448,fl,3

Florida State University,10-Mar-2020,"Florida State University has suspended ALL international university-related travel to prevent the potential spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).   

International travel requests will require approval by a university vice president until further notice. ANY international travel must be deemed essential in order to be approved by the travelers vice president.  

Florida State University requests that all individuals who have traveled internationally for work or personal reasons to comply with new university guidelines, based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) recommendations:   

 Travel to CDC Level 2 &3 Countries and all Cruises: mandatory 14-day self-quarantine upon reentry into the United States  
The CDC and U.S. State Department strongly discourage all travel by cruise ships worldwide.    
If you travel to any other area with community transmission, contact the Division of Student Affairs or Department of Human Resources if you need to self-quarantine or self-isolate. Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown. If it cannot be connected to travel, then it suggests that community transmission is occurring. 

Have a plan  
With spring break approaching, we strongly recommend you formulate a plan in case you are required to self-quarantine for a 14-day period for any reason (including illness, international and all cruise ship travel or close contact with a COVID-19 case).   

Your plan should include a possible quarantine location that is not a shared living space, residence hall or multi-occupancy apartment. 

All students should take all necessary academic course materials with them when they depart for spring break, in case they need to resume their spring courses remotely from home. 

FSU will continue to follow CDC, state and county health department guidelines, which means those who are required to self-quarantine, should practice social distancing as explained here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html    

If a student needs to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework remotely.  

New FSU coronavirus webpage  
The university has created a new website to aggregate all the universitys coronavirus information, messaging and instructions. Please refer to fsu.edu/coronavirus for the latest official updates on coronavirus (COVID-19), including a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). The page will be updated frequently.  

The FSU Alert webpage will remain the online location for urgent emergency information and instructions. Continue to visit alerts.fsu.edu anytime the operational status of the university may be in question (e.g., severe weather or dangerous situations).  

University guidance for possible encounters with COVID-19  
No cases of the virus have been reported at FSU, but the university is being proactive to prevent the spread of COVID-19.   

If you have recently returned from travel to an event or location (e.g., a conference or other large gathering) where a potential novel coronavirus COVID-19 case occurred or was present, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends self-quarantine only for individuals who were in close contact with a case of COVID-19. The CDC defines close contact as being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on).   

If you were NOT in close contact with a case of COVID-19, here are some reminders on what to do to keep yourself healthy:  

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  
Stay home when you are sick.  
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.  
If you WERE in close contact with a case of COVID-19, or during the next 14 days you feel sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing, please do the following:  

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctors office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to an area with potential community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.  
Avoid contact with others and do not travel while sick.  
Avoid using public transportation if possible.  
Please notify the university if you self-quarantine or self-isolate   
Students who self-quarantine and need assistance should contact Tyler Shannon in Case Management Services, at tdshannon@fsu.edu  or 850-644-9561.   

As previously mentioned, if a student needs to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework remotely.

Florida State University,12-Mar-2020,"Florida State University continues to monitor the COVID-19 Coronavirus situation closely. At this time, there are no reported cases on campus or in Tallahassee and Leon County. There is no immediate risk for the FSU campus. The University shifted to online courses as a mitigation strategy to reduce the amount of people on campus. This was a crucial preventative measure due to spring break and the various travel plans of our students. Faculty and staff who travel to impacted areas during this time, should also follow recommendations to self-isolate. However, it is strongly recommended that all faculty, staff, and students refrain from domestic and international travel except for emergency purposes.

Being Prepared

It is important for all employees to be prepared for remote work in the event of an outbreak. However, because there are currently no reported cases of COVID-19 in the area, employees are expected to adhere to their normal work hours and locations, whenever possible. If there are individual circumstances that warrant an employee working remotely, contact the Office of Human Resources. These situations will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This is an evolving situation and procedures will be updated based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control  (CDC), the Florida Department of Health  (FDOH), and World Health Organization  (WHO). For the most up-to-date announcements regarding the Universitys response to COVID-19, please refer to the FSU Coronavirus page.

We strongly recommend you formulate a plan in case you are required to self-quarantine for a 14-day period for any reason. If you travel to any other area with an outbreak, contact the Office of Human Resources if you need to self-quarantine or self-isolate.

FSU Workplace Policies

Faculty and Staff play an important role in helping transition coursework to online content and continuing the operations of the institution. Understandably, there are many questions about how preventative self-quarantine and the possibility of remote work and moving classes online, impact existing Human Resources Policies. The Office of Human Resources has provided specific guidance for faculty and staff questions related to our policies. The Coronavirus Workplace Guidance page and FAQs provide full details to assist faculty and staff during this time.

Due to the statewide closure of all K-12 schools and guidance from health officials, effective Tuesday, March 17, we are encouraging employees whose job duties are conducive to remote work, to do so with appropriate approval. Departments may not shut down and are expected to remain open with the appropriate coverage (with full-time salaried employees) to ensure the University remains fully operational. Employees must still be able to perform the essential functions of their respective positions, remotely or in person. Special consideration should be given to employees with underlying health issues that may increase the severity of infection should they come in contact with COVID-19.

For employees who are not able to perform their essential job functions remotely, we ask that departments and supervisors be flexible with leave approvals when necessary when personal circumstances warrant. Departments are advised to develop a temporary schedule to rotate shifts for employees who need to be on campus to perform their work duties or keep the department operational to promote social distancing. In addition, departments such as FSUPD, Emergency Management, Facilities, Environmental Health and Safety, Health and Wellness, Human Resources, Controllers Office, Procurement, University Libraries, Housing, Information Technology Services, and Campus Recreation are considered essential and should ensure the appropriate on-campus coverage to support institutional needs.

Human Resources will temporarily remove any childcare requirements for remote work and provide automatic, immediate approval upon receipt of the completed Temporary Remote Work Guidelines Acknowledgement . While some employees will have the option to work from home, please remember that minor children should not be on campus. The guidelines regarding minors in the workplace are available in the FSU & You  handbook.

Additional information on the University Temporary Remote Work Policy Guidelines (including eligible and ineligible positions) and instructions for coordinating with Human Resources can be found here.

The University is working hard to remain flexible as we continue to follow the guidance of health professionals. It remains our paramount goal to keep our entire campus community safe by proactively mitigating risk to our employees. We also want to provide employees with the support they need to continue their daily job functions while being able to care for family needs. We will continue to evaluate and monitor this dynamic situation and communicate accordingly.

Florida State University,17-Mar-2020,"University remains open for business; coursework resumes online as scheduled on Monday   
This message to all students, faculty and staff has been approved by FSU President John Thrasher. 

Florida State University will follow the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State University System of Florida (SUS) by extending the previously announced period of online instruction for all academic courses through the remainder of the spring semester. This move to online instruction includes the FSU Panama City campus. 

These steps are necessary, and, as disappointing as they may be, are in the best interest of our entire community. All of the universitys immediate efforts continue to be focused on supporting our faculty, staff and students. 

At this time, there are still no reported cases of COVID-19 at Florida State University or in Leon County. 

Tuesday, the State University System of Florida directed all state universities to extend remote instruction through the end of the spring semester. The SUS also encouraged all students who can return home to do so. 

In addition, the State University System announced all traditional on-campus commencement ceremonies will not be held as scheduled and directed each university to develop an alternate schedule or method of delivery.  

President Thrasher and the entire administration recognize that commencement is a joyous time for our students and their families. The university is working to develop an alternative commencement plan to celebrate all of our deserving graduates impacted this spring. Details will be announced at a later date. 

Florida State University is on spring break this week. As the university previously announced, academic courses will resume after spring break via distance learning, beginning Monday, March 23. FSU is prepared to finish the spring semester via distance learning and other alternative methods as directed. 

While university administrators strongly recommend students follow the SUS guidance to return home if possible, residence halls at Florida State remain open to those student residents who previously opted to stay on campus during spring break.  

Those students will be allowed to remain in the residence halls through the end of the spring semester. However, they will not be allowed to return to their residence hall if they travel away from Tallahassee for any reason before the end of the semester. 

Students who departed Tallahassee for spring break should not return to campus for any reason until further notice. Specific instructions for the retrieval of personal belongings from campus and residence hall move-out will be announced at a later date. 

Students who choose to leave campus should take with them any and all belongings. 

FSU administrators emphasized the spring semester is not over, and students are expected attend their classes online beginning Monday, March 23, for the remainder of the semester. 

Faculty and staff are expected to report to work as normal in their regularly assigned work locations. Florida State is encouraging employees whose job duties are conducive to remote work, to do so with appropriate approval. 

Florida States highest priority remains the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff. University officials will continue to proactively monitor and follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Florida Department of Health and other medical authorities. 

Administrators understand our students and families have a lot of questions, and they are working to quickly address the issues and questions that will naturally follow. For students currently in campus housing, the university will provide additional guidance as soon as possible.  

FSU will continue to do all it can operationally, academically and morally to support our students, faculty and staff.

Florida State University,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Spring Graduates, 

As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread around the world, Florida State University is committed to protecting the health and safety of the university community, as well as our families and friends. 

One of the best ways to stop the spread of this dangerous disease is to avoid large gatherings and crowds. Thats why FSU and all State University System of Florida institutions have canceled this springs commencement ceremonies. 

While it is extraordinarily disappointing to cancel one of lifes most joyous occasions, this is a necessary step to keep our community safe.  

I understand this is upsetting news for our graduates and their families, friends, faculty and mentors. This years commencement was to be extra special for Jean and me, and our immediate family, as my granddaughter is graduating alongside you, so I certainly understand and share your disappointment. This should be a time when graduates are lining up at Westcott Fountain to take photos in their caps and gowns, laughing with friends at the Senior Toast and reflecting on their journeys of academic and personal growth.  



Ive said many times that nothing makes me happier than seeing our students realize their dreams of an FSU degree, and please be assured that we will celebrate your important milestone when it is safe to do so. 

In the meantime, the university plans to release an online ceremony that includes messages from the academic deans, the dean of the Graduate School and the dean of Undergraduate Studies, who will confer academic degrees to our deserving graduates.  

Once circumstances allow, FSU plans to invite our Spring 2020 graduates and their families and friends back to campus to enjoy a true celebration of their achievements.  

Over the past few years, we have faced many challenges, and I have always been impressed by your resilience. Together, we will get through this, too. I urge you to stay safe, use good judgement and finish the semester strong! 

Sincerely, 

John Thrasher

Florida State University,20-Mar-2020,"Amid a global pandemic, Florida State University is mobilizing to protect the health and safety of the university community by delivering classes remotely for the remainder of the spring semester.

With an enrollment of about 42,000 students and more than 3,000 faculty and instructors, the transition from in-person classes to remote teaching is a huge undertaking.

This is something weve never done at this level of magnitude before for our faculty as well as our students, said FSU President John Thrasher. I want the students to continue to get the kind of education they came to Florida State for. Our faculty wants to deliver that education. This is just a new mode of doing that, and I think it can be successful.

While Thrasher knows its not an ideal situation, hes encouraging everyone to work together and be patient as FSU begins a new era of education.



The confidence I have in our faculty is overwhelming, he said. I know theyre working hard to make it happen. We had a nice meeting with the deans and chairs earlier in the week and theyre all committed to making this work because theyre committed to our students, and thats what this faculty is about. Theyre strong.

Provost Sally McRorie and the Academic Affairs team have been preparing to shift classes online for weeks. Theyre following an emergency model FSU put together in 2018, when Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida Panhandle and prompted the FSU Panama City campus to move to remote learning.

As COVID-19 cases have risen around the state and the nation, its been an all-hands-on-deck project to make sure students avoid any disruption Ñ or delays Ñ in their academic journeys.

This is certainly an unprecedented experience for all of us at Florida State, but we are very resilient and proud to be, McRorie said. We are facing it head on.

She said her team has been extremely busy trying to work through all the various new ways faculty and students have to approach teaching and learning. McRorie reinforced that student success is one of Florida States top priorities and that faculty and staff are dedicated to making sure FSU students have the best experience possible.

There will be some little glitches along the way, probably more so the beginning of next week, when all classes will be taught remotely, McRorie said, but we have great learning teams, teaching teams, we have terrific resources in our IT department and our Office of Distance Learning, along with great support for teaching and learning everywhere in the university.

The Office of Distance Learning is using a variety of different tools, including Zoom, an online video conferencing service, and Canvas, FSUs learning management system, to make that happen.

We applied the academic and technology resources at our disposal to help make this happen on short notice, said Robert Fuselier, director of the Office of Distance Learning. Were trying to help faculty create meaningful activities for students.

Kim Houghton, a business analyst with the Office of Distance Learning, said the goal is to offer some very basic steps that every faculty member would need to know to get some initial success online.

Our approach is more of a quick start guide, Houghton said. Once they get used to a few basic tools, then there are so many resources that were prepared to offer. We didnt want to overwhelm someone who had never taught online.

Fuselier said his team has focused on helping faculty who are primarily researchers and teach a few classes but who dont have a lot of interaction with academic technology.

The key is were trying to keep it as simple and approachable as possible, and the people have really taken it and run with it, he said.

Florida State prides itself on smaller classes and face-to-face opportunities and that is one of the hurdles faculty will have to overcome, McRorie said.

Those will be different, but we can still find ways to challenge students and to provide them many opportunities for learning, she said.

Different people have different strategies that seem to work for them, Fuselier added.

Theres been a lot of different approaches, and it will be interesting to see what happens because this is also a time when I think there is going to be a lot of ideas that we would like to capture and learn about, he said.

Thrasher said FSUs resilience is unparalleled, and the university will navigate any challenges together.

Were the 18th best public university in America, and were going to come out of this just as strong as we were and make this university even stronger, Thrasher said. Thats because our faculty cares about what happens to our students, and our students want to get the best education they can so they can go out and follow their dreams.

Florida State University,25-Mar-2020,"Some of the most memorable experiences for Florida State University students happen outside of the classroom. Now, with the university going remote for the rest of the spring semester amid a global pandemic, how will students stay connected with campus and one another?

One way that Florida State is supporting students is through Virtual FSU  a new, virtual hub for student services and engagement opportunities, created by the Division of Student Affairs.

Its important that while we are physically distant, we connect virtually with each other for our mental and physical health, said Amy Hecht, vice president for Student Affairs. Our goal is to continue, as best we can, offering the FSU experience and providing avenues for students to receive counseling, medical services and connecting with each other through a variety of online mechanisms. I know that our students are resilient, and we will all support each other during this time of uncertainty.

Virtual FSU includes information for virtual health and wellness, mental health services, the Career Center, Food Pantry, case management support as well as links to opportunities to be active, meet about wellness and find engaging things to do online.

Building and fostering digital communities is an extension of the work we do daily to craft the student experience and help students reach their full potential, said Danielle Acosta, interim director of Student Engagement. Through these platforms, we can engage in conversations, build relationships, continue to provide interactive services to support student success and empower students to positively impact the world. This is more important now than ever, as we are seeing in real time how truly interconnected that we are and how each of us have the opportunity to change the trajectory for others.

In addition to Virtual FSU, Students Affairs plans to further develop different and creative ways for student connection, celebration and ongoing virtual services.

For example, the DSA is hosting a new virtual event each Wednesday  RSO Rendezvous  in place of FSUs usual Market Wednesday on Legacy Walk. RSO Rendezvous will take place during the regular Market Wednesday time, from 10 a.m. 1 p.m.

Student Engagement is excited to use our online platforms and technology to continue to help RSOs thrive and be creative during this time, Acosta said. We are setting up social media challenges, creating new virtual experiences and helping students use resources that they may not have even known existed to continue doing some of their favorite activities critical to their FSU experience.

Other departments and groups around campus are getting in the virtual act, too. The Student Government Association, including FSUs Student Senate and Congress of Graduate Students, will meet virtually on a summer schedule for the remainder of the semester, and the College of Law has developed a virtual hub with daily lunchtime programming for students via Zoom that is accessible through the Office of Student Advancement Canvas page for Law students.

Student engagement is all about the connections and investment we have in each other, and in the Florida State community, Acosta said. Our community, the Florida State family, is strong, and one that comes together in trying and difficult times. This spring, we might not all physically be out on Landis Green or having dinner in the Ballrooms, but we are still in this together. We can still cheer each other, be involved, learn together, and support and celebrate each other.

Florida State University,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Students,

This is an unprecedented time in Florida State Universitys history as the entire campus has moved to remote learning, and we realize this may be a difficult adjustment for some students.

In response, FSU has modified its undergraduate grading policy for the 2020 spring semester.

Undergraduate courses that now use letter grades will continue to use letter grades. However, students may individually opt to receive a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grade for eligible courses rather than a letter grade.
Students enrolled in undergraduate courses may request S/U in eligible courses beginning at 9 a.m. ET Monday, March 30. All requests for the S/U option must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, April 12. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Student Information Guide on S/U to understand the implications of their choice should they choose to switch from letter grades to S/U grades. The students who request the S/U option will be informed how their choice may affect financial aid, progress toward degree, etc. Academic advisors also can help students in the decision-making process should students have additional questions.
Students may select to change one or all of the eligible undergraduate classes in which they are enrolled. There is no requirement that students change any course if they wish to continue receiving a letter grade for any or all of their eligible undergraduate classes.
To be clear, students may not opt for S/U status after 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, April 12.
Beginning March 30, students should consult their instructors as to what would constitute an S or U in each class. It may be different.
The grading policy for graduate courses will not change. All graduate courses will receive letter grades.
Students in professional programs should check with their respective colleges for any grading policy changes.
To request S/U in classes that use letter grades, see instructions on How to Change Letter Grades to S/U Grades .

Florida State University,26-Mar-2020,"Florida State University officials have launched an emergency fundraising effort aimed at helping students struggling due to financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The FSU Foundation, the universitys academic fundraising arm, unveiled two emergency funds that are accepting donations  one addressing the needs of those affiliated with FSU in Tallahassee, the other for those from FSU Panama City.

All funds will go to FSU students and will cover a variety of needs from medical bills, rent, living expenses and technology to help distance learning.

The Foundation has launched a webpage, foundation.fsu.edu/emergency , where visitors can pick a fund and send their donation. The effort mirrors the one initiated by FSU in the wake of Hurricane Michael which allowed donors to contribute online and raised more than $150,000.

In an email to the university community, FSU President John Thrasher called for a similar response and said FSU needed to move quickly to help support those in need.

These student emergency funds were created to quickly address a variety of our students needs  from food insecurity and medical bills to technology and housing assistance, he said.

Officials also announced that proceeds raised from this years edition of FSUs Great Give, which is postponed until April 7, will be used to support the student emergency funds.

Funds will be distributed as needed and financial support is identified.

Donations to these funds will have an immediate impact, said Tom Jennings, vice president for University Advancement and president of the FSU Foundation. Even though our student community is physically spread far and wide, we are dedicated to doing everything possible to ensure they can succeed in this time of crisis.

Thrasher also reminded people to visit the university food pantry Amazon Wish List  to see which items are in greatest demand.

Gifts can be made online using credit card, debit card or PayPal at https://give.fsu.edu/studentemergency  for the Tallahassee campus student emergency fund or https://give.fsu.edu/pcstudents  for the Panama City campus student emergency fund.

Gifts may also be made via check payable to the FSU Foundation. Reference Fund F08909 for the Tallahassee campus or Fund F08686 for the Panama City campus.

Florida State University will implement a Student Refund Plan for students who have paid or have been assessed housing and dining charges for the Spring 2020 semester and are no longer utilizing these services, with the following considerations:

March 23, 2020 is considered the last service date for housing and meal plans.
For University Housing residents, we will refund the respective spring semester rate per individual resident based on their number of unutilized bed nights and the specific rate for the residence hall in which they lived.
For students on the Residential Dining Services All-Access Meal Plan, we will refund the respective spring semester rate per unused days and Flex Bucks. Block Meal Plans will be refunded based on the unused meal balance and Flex Bucks. Garnet Bucks will automatically roll over based on the Meal Plan Terms and Conditions.
Refunds will be applied to students university accounts. Any university balance will be paid prior to the refund being disbursed.
Acceptance of the refunds will constitute full resolution of the students residence hall and meal plan agreements.
We expect to electronically issue refunds the week of April 6. This will allow us time to calculate refund amounts and ensure all refunds are compliant with financial aid rules based on U.S. Department of Education and State of Florida guidance. During this time, we encourage students to verify their direct deposit profile in MyFSU.

Florida State University,1-Apr-2020,"As a result of Governor DeSantis safer at home order, the University is restricting all on-campus operations to essential functions only effective April 3, 2020, until at least April 30, 2020. The restriction of on-campus operations means that only essential personnel are required on campus. However, University business operations will continue and faculty and staff who are working remotely should continue to work their normal hours. If an employee working remotely needs to return to campus prior to the Governors executive order going into effect to gather work items, they must continue to practice appropriate social distancing.

On-Campus Essential Employees

At this time, on campus essential employees are defined as employees designated to report to the workplace while on-campus operations are restricted. Vice Presidents, Deans, Directors, and Department Heads must designate which on-campus functions are essential and require an employee to be on-campus to perform critical on-campus University functions. On campus essential personnel that may be required to work on campus include, but are not limited to:

those ensuring the safety and security of campus facilities and information technology; protection of University assets (e.g., health care services, police);
maintenance of research labs and utilities that cannot suspend operations;
those providing limited services to students who remain on-campus (e.g. housing, designated food services);
those required for continuity of services including maintenance/grounds/janitorial
those providing medical services;
those who are needed to process financial transactions and services;
those who provide support for information technology; and
those facilitating distance learning.
Leave for on campus essential employees may be approved for employees that have a qualifying sick reason; are required to self-quarantine due to travel outside of the Tallahassee area and surrounding counties; or due to a recommendation by a health care provider. Please consult with your immediate supervisor prior to traveling outside of the Tallahassee area and surrounding counties.

Some employees may be designated as on campus essential employees but may not be needed for full-time work. Those employees must work the hours that are required and then will be provided Emergency Sick Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) to supplement the additional hours. For example, an employee may only be required to report to campus to perform essential duties for 20 hours, and then will be provided 20 hours of FFCRA Emergency Sick Leave. Additionally, departments should consider alternative schedules for essential employees to promote social distancing.

Remote Work Employees

All employees who are not designated as on campus essential employees will be required to work remotely, as long as their duties and responsibilities are conducive to such work. Although on campus operations are restricted, remote work will continue. Employees are still required to submit a Temporary Remote Work Acknowledgement form. Please visit the Temporary Remote Work Guidelines webpage for additional resources and guidance.

The Universitys restriction of on campus operations will include significantly reducing the amount of facilities staff available to provide the usual cleaning and sanitation services in University Academic and Research buildings. As a result, we cannot guarantee that facilities will be maintained on a daily basis in a manner that meets with best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For these reasons, and for your own continued health and safety, the University must insist that all employees not designated as on campus essential work remotely at all possible times. If there are additional measures you need in order accomplish remote work, please advise your department head or chair.

Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)

Employees whose job responsibilities do not support remote work and who are not considered to be on campus essential employees, or are unable to work remotely due to childcare or other COVID-19 related reasons, will be granted up to 80 hours (prorated for part-time employees) of Emergency Sick Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). Employees are required to submit the Emergency Paid Sick Leave  form to initiate the paid leave. Once a salaried non-essential employee (Faculty, USPS, and A&P) has exhausted their 80-hour entitlement, they will qualify for paid administrative leave through April 30, 2020. If the University restricts on campus operations beyond April 30, leave statuses will be reevaluated at that time.

How Should Departments Prepare?

Departments should prepare immediately for a shutdown of nonessential campus operations. Supervisors must work with employees who are able to work remotely to ensure they have access to all the equipment, files, resources, etc. that they need to perform their work from home. Most of this planning has already occurred, but access to buildings will be limited to those that are designated as essential. Supervisors must keep in mind social distancing when coordinating the pick-up of items that employees may need.

Departmental Mail and Packages

Departments should continue to process their mail to ensure the timely deposit of checks and processing of vendor invoices/payments. Campus mail will continue to be delivered to departmental mailrooms on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If a department would like to pick up mail at Postal Services (800 West Madison Street), please send an email to postal@fsu.edu  with the full name of the departmental representative authorized to pick up mail for the department. This person must be prepared to show their current University issued identification (FSUCard).

Packages received by Postal Services will be held for department pick up. If you are working remotely from home, you may ship ordered items to your home address with appropriate departmental approval and documentation. Click here for more information.

Resources

There is simply not enough that can be said to commend the campus community for the exceptional resiliency shown during these uncertain times.

You must register for Orientation no later than May 1st and will receive information about completing your Orientation session at least one week before it begins. Many of the questions listed below will be answered in greater detail as part of your Virtual Orientation. 

Below are answers to some common questions to get you started with your preparations to become a Seminole this summer. You will also find a very helpful list of resources for students at this link. 

Admissions & Accelerated Credit 
I have not paid my admissions deposit and I know I have until May 1 to decide if I want to enroll at FSU. With everything that is going on, can I have more time to decide?  We understand that some students and families may need more time before making a final decision on what college to attend by the traditional May 1 deposit deadline. If that is you, please email us at admissions@fsu.edu  and let us know that you need more time. We will be glad to give you more time to make this important decision. Please know that the earlier you can decide, the better we can plan for your arrival on campus or extend invitations to other students.

I am not sure my high school will end before the Summer term starts. What should I do? The June Summer term is scheduled to begin Monday, June 22. We recognize that some high schools might need to extend their academic year into June and possibly beyond. If your high school term extends beyond our June 22 start date, we will work with you either to adjust your Summer term start date or switch your admission to our Fall term which begins August 24.

I may not be able to get my official high school transcript showing my high school graduation before the Summer term starts. Is that a problem? We are aware of this possibility. This will not be a problem and it will not keep you from starting classes in the Summer. Just get the final transcript to us as soon as it becomes available.

I wont have my AP, IB, or Cambridge results before Summer starts. How do I know what classes to take? During Orientation, you should speak with your advisor about the credit you think you will earn. Your advisor will help you select classes that will not conflict with the credit you might earn via exam results.

Will campus be open for the Fall term or will it be online? At this time, the Fall 2020 term is scheduled to begin on August 24 as normal. In the event it becomes necessary to make a change, we will notify all students immediately.

What about my immunizations and health insurance requirements? FSU is aware of the challenges students may be experiencing obtaining immunizations in light of the current novel coronavirus pandemic. University Health Services will provide temporary deferments to allow for class registration. Deferments are approved on a case-by-case basis. If you are unable to meet your immunization requirement, please contact the UHS health compliance staff. The University requires that students have health insurance, but if you have specific concerns or questions, please contact the UHS health compliance staff. 

Summer Classes 
Do I need anything special to take online courses? You will need a computer with speakers and internet access at a minimum. A web camera, either as part of the computer or as an add-on, is preferred. Additional information about computer specifics are available if you have questions. You can learn more about the technical requirements and the essential online tools and applications you need in the Student Guide to Learning Online and this Tips for Learning Online. 

I am not sure that I have everything I need to take online courses. Is there someone I can contact about my situation? If you have a question about your hardware or software, please contact The ITS Service Desk which can provide assistance or referrals to additional support services. If you do not have a computer or internet availability, please contact Case Management Services at casemanagement@fsu.edu . 

How many classes will I be expected to take? The typical course load for a summer term is two courses or 6 semester hours, but you may take up to 9 semester hours. Your advisor during Orientation can help you decide how many hours to take. 

What type of classes will be available? Summer course offerings will be very similar to previous years. Seats in many popular summer classes have been reserved for incoming students and you can discuss options with your advisor during Orientation. Most students focus on pre-requisites for their major and General Education courses to get started, and these will be widely available.

Will I be able to meet with an academic advisor to help me pick the right classes? You will have an opportunity to meet with an academic advisor during Orientation. They will help you choose and enroll in appropriate summer classes.

After I register for classes, can I make changes to my schedule? Changing your schedule after you have selected your courses is known as Drop/Add. You have until the end of the first week of classes to adjust your schedule by adding or dropping a course. This process will be explained as part of Orientation.

How do I get my textbooks or other required class materials? All books and other class materials may be purchased through the FSU bookstore  and shipped to your house. 

I have special learning needs. Is there someone I can contact about my situation? Students can apply for learning accommodation services through the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS). You may apply for services at any time during the semester, but the OAS will require at least seven (7) days to process your application and schedule the intake meeting. The application is available online.

Do I need proof of immunizations and health insurance to start in the summer? Yes. FSU is aware of the challenges students may be experiencing in obtaining immunizations in light of the current novel coronavirus pandemic. University Health Services will still be adherent to the Universitys policies and procedures regarding immunizations but will provide temporary waivers to allow for class registration until students return to campus in order to accommodate for the difficulties you may be currently encountering in obtaining immunizations. The University requires that students have health insurance, but if you have specific concerns or questions, please contact the UHS health compliance staff.

I am thinking about taking a math class but am not sure which one will be best for me.  FSU uses the online ALEKS math placement test, which is administered online. If you need to take the test, you will receive registration information via email. You must take the test before attending Orientation.

I am thinking about taking a language class. Is there anything special I need to do? For those students who have initiated foreign language study prior to entering Florida State University (specifically in high school where no college credit was awarded), selection of the appropriate language course level is extremely important. For that reason, a mandatory (no cost) placement test is required for all students who plan to continue study in either French, German, or Spanish and have not already received college credit for that language. Students who are studying a new language which they did not study in high school, and for which they have no other experience, are not required to take such a test but would enroll in the 1120 level of the language of interest. Please go here for more information about language placement testing. 

Are online courses harder than face to face courses? Online courses are not more difficult than face-to-face courses. The difference is how they are designed to support your learning. Instructors in online courses utilize many technologies and strategies to support your learning and connect you with fellow students. These strategies may be different than what you are used to experiencing in an in-person class. FSU faculty are committed to providing quality learning opportunities, regardless of delivery method.

How often do online classes meet? Classes will be either synchronous (taught live) or asynchronous (online with no scheduled meeting time). Heres how to tell the difference:

Classes with specific days/time listed: These are synchronous classes. The class will meet virtually at those times via Zoom or other technologies. The registration system will not allow you to enroll in remote, synchronous classes with overlapping times. 

Classes with days/time listed as TBA: These are asynchronous classes. The class will not meet virtually at a specific time and will use other teaching methods like recorded videos so coursework can be done at your convenience. 

 Will the online courses be pass/fail or graded? Summer online courses will receive letter grades. For more information on the FSU grading policy go here. 

Tuition, Fees, & Financial Aid 
How much will my classes cost? Tuition and Fees are assessed per credit hour, so your cost will vary depending upon the number of hours and the type of courses you take. For in-state residents, most courses will cost $215.55 per semester hour, so for six semester hours the approximate cost will be $1293. For out-of-state residents, most courses will cost $721.10 per semester hour, so for six semester hours the approximate cost will be $4,327. You will know your exact cost after you register for your classes. Additional information regarding tuition and fees may be seen here.

There are fees associated with some of my classes and not others. Why is this? Some courses are assessed additional costs for online fees, labs, materials and supplies, and general cost recovery. Most online classes have a distance learning fee per credit hour in addition to regular tuition and fees. This supports the additional staff and technologies required to create and teach the online class. Traditional, face-to-face courses being taught remotely do not have a distance learning fee. For a full list of these courses and costs, download the Additional Cost file here .

Is financial aid available for the Summer? Yes. To receive Financial Aid for the Summer, you must submit the 2019-2020 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and register for at least 6 semester hours of credit.  If you have specific questions, we ask that you reach out to the Office of Financial Aid via email at financialaid@fsu.edu . 

I qualified for a Bright Futures Scholarship from the state of Florida. Can I receive it this Summer? Yes. Both the Academic Scholars and Medallion scholarship will be available to you although the book stipend for the Academic Scholars is only available in the Fall and Spring.

I have a financial aid award for the Summer. How will I get my money and when? Disbursement of summer financial aid to students enrolled in session C will begin on 6/16/2020 for federal grant and loan awards. Bright Futures awards will be disbursed to eligible students at the end of drop add on 6/30/2020 and every week thereafter. Additional information related to financial aid may be viewed on our website. In order to get your money, you must enroll in Direct Deposit. 

When I have finished registering for my classes, when and how do I pay for them? If you receive financial aid like Bright Futures, scholarships or other aid, this will be posted to your account automatically based on the disbursement schedule. You can check your balance in the Campus Solution system and pay your balance. You learn more about this during Orientation.

Housing & Dining 
Will University Housing be available? There will not be University Housing available for the Summer C term. Your first opportunity to live on campus will be in the fall semester. If you havent already done so, complete your fall contract on the housing portal. More information can be found on the University Housing website.

I submitted a contract for on-campus housing for the summer. Will I get a refund? Yes, if you have already contracted for housing for Summer C, your deposit will be credited to your student account.  

I purchased an on-campus dining plan for the summer. Will I get a refund? Meal plan charges will not yet have been posted to your account. You will not be charged for this.

Success in Online Classes 
How do I get started with online learning at FSU? Learning online is a different experience from a traditional, face-to-face classroom. You will need access to technology to connect with your instructor, as well as good organization and time-management skills. The Student Guide to Learning Online provides steps to help you get setup and ready to learn online.

What technology do I need for online classes? You will need a computer with speakers and internet access at a minimum. A web camera, either as part of the computer or as an add-on, may be required for some courses. Access to Canvas, Office 365, and many other programs is available either free or at significantly reduced costs for FSU students. You can learn more about the technical requirements and the essential online tools and applications you need in the Student Guide to Learning Online.

What do I do if I dont have access to a computer or internet? Students experiencing financial hardship related to acquiring the appropriate technology, should contact Case Management Services at casemanagement@fsu.edu . For free and discounted WiFi, check out the ITS Free and Discounted WiFi Options page.

What is the difference between remote and online classes? Classes will be offered online (a course specially designed for online learning) or remote (traditional lecture or discussion-based classes offered through online platforms). You can search for remote offerings in MyFSUsClass Search using the Physical Location field.

Classes will be either synchronous (taught live) or asynchronous (online with no scheduled meeting time). Heres how to tell the difference: 

Classes with specific days/time listed: These are synchronous classes. The class will meet virtually at those times via Zoom or other technologies. The registration system will not allow you to enroll in remote, synchronous classes with overlapping times.

Classes with days/time listed as TBA: These are asynchronous classes. The class will not meet virtually at a specific time and will use other teaching methods like recorded videos so coursework can be done at your convenience.

How can I get help with my classes? FSU has a multitude of resources to help you be successful in your classes, whether online or face-to-face. You will learn about these during Orientation. In the meantime, you might want to look at the websites of the Academic Center for Excellence, FSU Libraries, Reading Writing Center, and the Johnston Digital Studio. There you may schedule online appointments for tutoring or other academic support services for students.

Getting Connected at FSU 
Where do I go to learn about virtual events and activities that are happening? There are many ways to engage with the FSU community during Summer C, from online fitness classes and dialogues to International Coffee Hour, gaming competitions and student live tweeting events.

Florida State University,15-Apr-2020,"As our highest priority remains the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, Florida State University will continue to deliver classes remotely during Summer Session C, which runs June 22 through July 31, 2020. This extension of online instruction includes the FSU Panama City campus.

Along with classes remaining online through the end of the summer semester, FSU will cancel or postpone all in-person events consisting of 10 people or more to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus. This cancellation of on-campus events includes all summer camps and activities normally held at the university. This policy shall be in effect until Aug. 2, 2020, and will be under continual review.

In addition, University Housing will not be available for the Summer C term for first-time students or those who left campus earlier this spring. If a student has already contracted for housing for Summer C, their deposit will be credited to their student account.

For many students, Summer C will be their first semester in college. While it is disappointing that we cannot offer in-person classes or housing at this time, FSU is diligently working to support all students and ensure they receive a top-notch education.

Knowing that many students will be first-time FSU students, either as freshmen or transfers, we have prepared an extensive list of Frequently Asked Questions to help address questions and concerns. We also will have a similar guide specialized for graduate students and post-docs posted soon on The Graduate Schools webpage at gradschool.fsu.edu. We want to help every FSU student succeed!

Florida State will continue to closely monitor and evaluate information and guidance provided by state and federal agencies. This is an unprecedented situation, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to make decisions that keep our university community safe.

Florida State University,16-Apr-2020,"Editors note: Names of the 7,000 graduates will be read aloud by their college in separate videos to be posted at commencement.fsu.edu on May 2. Graduates names will not be read aloud during the virtual ceremony as doing so would extend the program by several hours.

Graduates and families invited to participate remotely while practicing social distancing

Florida State University will stream a virtual commencement ceremony for its spring graduates Saturday, May 2.

President John Thrasher will preside over the ceremony, which will be streamed on the universitys website, Facebook and YouTube channels. The ceremony will begin at 2 p.m. ET.

We were all heartbroken when the coronavirus pandemic forced us to cancel spring commencement at the Tucker Center, Thrasher said. We still want to recognize our students on graduation day and award the academic degrees that they earned through years of study and hard work. Hopefully, this virtual ceremony will give our graduates and their loved ones an opportunity to participate in a meaningful shared experience.

The virtual ceremony will incorporate many of the traditional customs associated with the usual on-campus commencement exercises, such as an opening processional to Pomp and Circumstance, the playing of the National Anthem, the Pledge of Allegiance, the official conferring of graduate and undergraduate academic degrees, and the turning of tassels on the graduates caps.

Thrasher will be joined at the virtual ceremony by a handful of university administrators in full academic regalia. Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Sally McRorie, Dean of Undergraduate Studies Karen Laughlin, Dean of the Graduate School Mark Riley, and Dean of the Jim Moran College of Entrepreneurship Susan Fiorito will participate while observing social distancing guidelines.

Ed Burr, chair of the FSU Board of Trustees, and 2019-2020 Student Body President Evan Steinberg will deliver brief remarks via video.

The virtual ceremony will also include a commencement address by Mark Zeigler, a teaching professor from the FSU School of Communication.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of traditional spring commencement ceremonies scheduled at Florida State and at other institutions across the nation. FSU normally hosts four separate commencement ceremonies at the end of the spring semester to accommodate its graduates and their guests.

Several changes have been made to shorten the ceremony and ensure the health and safety of the participants. No graduates or guests will be present. Graduates and their family members and friends should remain at home and not come to campus.

Graduates names will not be individually announced during the virtual ceremony due to time constraints. Names will briefly appear at the end of the virtual ceremony and can be found in the digital commencement program that will be posted online at commencement.fsu.edu prior to the ceremony.

Florida State will award degrees to 6,973 graduates this semester: 5,628 bachelors degrees, 1,134 masters degrees and 211 doctorates. These totals include graduates at FSU Panama City and the universitys campus in the Republic of Panama. The university will recognize students who have earned academic honors as well as student-veterans and members of the Garnet and Gold Scholar Society.

The College of Medicine, which will graduate 114 new medical doctors, has scheduled a virtual commencement ceremony for 10 a.m. Saturday, May 16. The ceremony will be livestreamed at med.fsu.edu. The College of Law will award 159 juris doctor degrees, 33 juris masters degrees and five LL.M. degrees at a ceremony to be held at a later date.

A campus celebration for the spring 2020 graduates will be held at a future date after public health officials determine it is safe to resume large social gatherings. Plans will be announced well in advance to allow sufficient time to make travel arrangements.

When its safe to do so, we hope our spring graduates will come back to campus so we can celebrate together, Thrasher said. In the meantime, we hope they will participate in this virtual ceremony and share their commencement photos and videos with the university community via social media.

The virtual spring commencement ceremony will be streamed at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 2, via the following websites and social media platforms:

live.wfsu.org 
YouTube.com/floridastate 
Facebook.com/floridastate 

The virtual ceremony will also be telecast in the Tallahassee area at 6:30 p.m. May 2, on Comcast cable channel 4.

It will be archived online for future viewing on-demand at www.learningforlife.fsu.edu/fsu-graduation/

Florida State University,27-Apr-2020,"Florida State University is open and operational. The Governors Safer-at-Home order remains in effect and on-campus operations continue to be restricted to essential functions only.

Effective May 1, 2020, employees who are unable to perform their work remotely and have exhausted Emergency Paid Sick Leave and Emergency Family and Medical Leave, if applicable, should begin using their personal leave (annual, sick or compensatory). If personal leave has been exhausted, employees should record leave without pay. In the event that the Governor lifts the current Safer-at-Home order, additional guidance will be issued at that time regarding what operations will be permitted to resume on campus.

The following instructions remain in place for other employees as follows:

On-campus essential employees should continue reporting to work as instructed by their supervisors.
All employees who are able to work remotely should continue to do so. Managers must ensure that employees who are working remotely have sufficient, meaningful work to perform. Managers should work with employees to supplement leave on timesheets if there is not sufficient work available to fulfill the normal work schedule. For guidance on assisting employees with remote work, please visit the Human Resources COVID-19 FAQs question Im not sure what remote work options are available to me. What should I do?.
The University continues to monitor the dynamic COVID-19 situation. As new information becomes available, we are committed to keeping the campus community informed as quickly and accurately as possible. Thank you for your patience, dedication, and adaptability during this time.

For additional assistance, contact the Office of Human Resources.

Florida State University,30-Apr-2020,Florida State University administrators are aware of the plans announced Wednesday by Gov. Ron DeSantis. FSU is evaluating and anticipates providing updated guidance for employees in the next 24 hours.,30,fl,4
Florida State University,5-May-2020,"On April 29, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order 20-112   and unveiled the first step of a phased approach to re-opening the state. Phase 1 became effective May 4, 2020. If local governments allow, restaurants and retail businesses are allowed to operate at 25% capacity, and hospitals will reinstate elective procedures with the exception of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. Schools will continue with distance learning for the remainder of the school year throughout the state. High-risk individuals are encouraged to continue to shelter in place.

Effective today, employees who would like to return to campus to work or who have been unable to perform their work remotely, may return (based on the availability of work) with supervisory approval. Although on-campus operations remain restricted, departments may allow employees to return to their work location as long as no more than 25% of staff are present at one time. Employees who are able to work remotely may continue to do so. It is still strongly encouraged that employees who do return to campus continue to practice social distancing. Faculty will continue to hold classes online through Summer C. The amount of people present on campus will be restricted to 25% to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Deans, Directors, and Department Heads, in conjunction with managers and supervisors, are responsible for coordinating work schedules and ensuring that no more than 25% of staff are present in each location. We anticipate this status will remain in effect through May 29, 2020. Should more information become available before then, updated guidance will be provided accordingly.

Instructions regarding the resumption of on-campus research activities, to include the limited return of staff beginning on May 6, will be provided by Vice President Ostrander during the 7th Research Continuity Zoom Meeting today at 1:30 p.m.

Exemptions for Returning to Campus
Individuals who have recently traveled outside of the Tallahassee area should not return to campus until they have been COVID-19 symptom free at their normal place of residence for 14 days. Individuals who have experienced COVID-19 symptoms  within the last two weeks should not return to their work location until they have been symptom free for 14 days. Symptoms of COVID-19 include:

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Remote Work Employees
The majority of University business functions will still be performed remotely. Employees are not prohibited from coming to campus and may report to work to perform their job duties with supervisory approval. Employees who are able to perform their duties from a remote location should continue to do so. Since Leon County Schools will remain closed until the end of the school year, employees may continue to care for minor children while working from home. However, minor children are not permitted on campus.

Social Distancing
Employees who report to campus should continue to practice the CDC Guidelines for Social Distancing . Flexible or rotating schedules for on-campus employees are appropriate to reduce the amount of people sharing physical space. Continue to refrain from conducting in-person meetings with groups of people. In accordance with the Governors recommendations, employees are encouraged to wear a cloth face covering  when able, especially in situations where social distancing may be difficult.

High-Risk Employees
Special consideration should be given to employees who are 65 and older, and/or have underlying health issues that may increase the severity of infection should they contract COVID-19. The Governor advised that high-risk individuals stay home if they are able, avoid crowds, and practice social distancing when they have to be out. For high-risk employees that do not want to report to campus and are also unable to perform their duties remotely, we ask that supervisors consider approving sick or annual leave, unless operational functions would be severely impacted. Consult with Human Resources for additional guidance.

Administrative Leave
Employees who have been unable to perform their work remotely can come to campus based on the availability of work. April 30, 2020, was the last day for eligible employees to receive Administrative Leave. These employees must report to campus to perform their job duties or work with their supervisor and Department Head to arrange a flexible schedule.

Building Safety
Due to a reduced number of faculty, staff, and students present, facilities staff who provide the usual cleaning and sanitation services also have a limited presence on campus. As a result, we cannot guarantee that facilities will be maintained on a daily basis in a manner that meets with best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, buildings will remain locked and require card access for entry. Visitors are not permitted while on-campus operations are restricted.

Preparing for Phase 2
An announcement that Florida has advanced to Phase 2 will not automatically trigger a move to Phase 2 by the University. Once Phase 2 is announced, the University will review the plan and continue to assess the COVID-19 situation to determine if further guidance should be issued at that time. We anticipate requiring an in-person presence for all departments beginning in Phase 2. Departments should begin preparing for Phase 2 by developing a plan and schedule for employees to physically return with no more than 50% on campus at any given time.

Departments should develop rotating schedules for staff. Examples include:

Departments may alternate their presence in the department on a daily or half-day basis.
Departments may rotate on-campus presence weekly.
Departments may allow employees to come to their work location as needed to perform their job duties by checking in with the supervisor first to ensure a reduced footprint is maintained.

Florida State University,8-May-2020,"Executive Order 20-112   does not mandate the use of masks or cloth face coverings. However, the state has recommended that businesses follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance  to plan, prepare, and respond to COVID-19. Employees who report to campus should continue to practice the CDC Guidelines for Social Distancing . Employees should avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more and refrain from in-person meetings if alternatives for collaboration exist. The use of a face covering is an important preventive measure but is not a substitute for social distancing. In situations where close contact is difficult or unavoidable, such as when moving through shared spaces like hallways and elevators, employees should wear a face covering (cloth or disposable).

Deans, Directors, and Department Heads may mandate the use of face coverings when the nature of the work being performed requires it. If departments do mandate the use of face coverings, they should provide them for the employees who are required to wear them. The Environmental Health & Safety Office has already provided recommended specifications for cloth and disposable face coverings to Procurement to aid in their purchasing.

The CDC requires that cloth face coverings must:
Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Include multiple layers of fabric
Allow for breathing without restriction
Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape
If you are not a healthcare worker, do not request a face mask such as the N95 respirator. N95 respirators require special fit testing and individuals must be screened by a medical professional before use.

Please work with Procurement (procurement@fsu.edu ) on the purchasing of masks, face coverings or other Personal Protective Equipment.

Florida State University,12-May-2020,"_More than 12,500 Florida State University students will receive emergency federal funding provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to assist them with unexpected costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law to provide economic relief from COVID-19. It authorized the U.S. Department of Education to provide funding for universities and colleges to award in the form of emergency financial aid grants to eligible students.

FSU received $29.3 million from the CARES Act, of which $14.6 million is designated for emergency grants to students. The university will use the remaining funds to pay for other unexpected expenses due to COVID-19.

To be eligible for FSUÕs first wave of CARES Act funding distribution, students must have been enrolled in the Spring 2020 semester, submitted their federal financial aid application (FAFSA) for the 2019-2020 academic year, and must not have already received emergency relief funding from the university.

 In the first wave, students will receive grants between $400 and $600, totaling $6.24 million. The group includes students who have no expected family contribution, Pell grant recipients, and graduate and professional students with need greater than $1,000.

 FSU confirmed studentsÕ financial need based on their federal financial aid application on file with the university.

Students eligible to receive CARES Act funding were notified by email on May 11 and should receive funding as soon as May 13.  

The university will distribute additional CARES Act awards in the future. More information will be available at https://financialaid.fsu.edu/cares-act as those decisions are finalized.

Hundreds of students already have received financial assistance through FSUÕs Seminole Emergency Funds, which were created to quickly address a variety of needs. To date, 657 students have received an average award of $607.71. For more information on the Seminole Emergency Funds, visit https://foundation.fsu.edu/fnd-emergency.

Texas State University,30-Jan-2020," In response to the Novel Coronavirus outbreak, Texas State University has cancelled a planned summer 2020 Education Abroad trip to China. The cancellation is in accordance with the Texas State University System travel policy which stipulates that graduate and undergraduate students are not permitted to undertake official travel to regions designated Advisory Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or 4 (Do Not Travel) by the United States Department of State. China has been designated a Travel Advisory Level 3, and Hubei Province in China as Level 4.

 Currently, no Texas State students are on official Education Abroad trips in China.

 Texas State students are encouraged to stay informed on current United States Department of State travel advisories and to monitor Centers for Disease Control advisories.

 As the Vice President of Student Affairs Office shared in a university-wide email on January 24, the outbreak is being closely monitored by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization. The Texas State Student Health Center is also monitoring the situation and will follow any guidance provided by the CDC or state/local health department as the situation evolves.

Texas State University,2-Mar-2020,"Dear Texas State Community,

As news continues to evolve about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is understandable there may be concern on our campuses and in our community. I am providing this update to inform you about the precautionary measures being taken at Texas State University. I also want to stress that this is a time for all of us to demonstrate compassion, civility, and personal responsibility as we make the best decisions for our community.

Currently, no cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the Texas State community. However, it is critical to prepare as the situation evolves and more cases are identified in the United States and around the world. The Presidents Cabinet, our Chief Medical Officer Emilio Carranco, M.D., and the universitys Emergency Management Committee will continue to closely monitor the situation and follow federal and state guidelines as we take appropriate precautions.

Stay Informed:

Moving forward, all official university-wide communication about COVID-19 will come via email from Dr. Carranco via the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA) office with the subject line: Coronavirus (COVID19) University Update. The Student Health Center has created a webpage to provide the latest COVID-19 information for our Texas State community. 

Travel:

 University-approved travel (including study abroad) is prohibited to areas designated Advisory Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or 4 (Do Not Travel) by the United States Department of State, in accordance with The Texas State University System travel policy. We recommend you consult the U.S. Department of State travel advisories, especially as Spring Break is approaching, and take necessary precautions.

 Students, faculty, and staff returning from Level 3 designated areas are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. For those not able to quarantine at home, the university has designated a facility as an isolation area. Those returning from Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for 14 days. Dr. Carranco is working with all returning individuals to guide them through the self-quarantine and self-monitoring processes. 

  Non-official or personal travel to Level 3 and 4 restricted areas is strongly discouraged. Students, faculty, and staff who choose to visit Level 3 and 4 areas will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return. Those traveling to Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for signs of illness. This is for the protection of everyone in our community.

 The university will continue to monitor U. S. Department of State travel advisories and remain in close contact with students, faculty, and staff in study abroad and non-study abroad programs.

Protecting yourself and our community:

 We all have a responsibility to maintain the health and wellbeing of our community by following recommended respiratory hygiene practices and not exposing others to contagious illnesses.  If you feel sick, stay home from classes or work. Students who are ill and need to be absent from class should contact the Dean of Students office at (512) 245-2124. Faculty and staff should notify their supervisors. In addition, we urge you to follow these prevention guidelines to limit exposure to illness.

 As we focus on our Texas State community, it is also important to remember everyone around the world impacted by COVID-19. Avoid stereotyping or stigmatizing any individuals or groups and follow our Bobcat values, including treating all with respect and dignity.

 We will continue to monitor this situation and provide you with periodic updates. The health and wellbeing of every member of our Texas State family remains our top priority, and we will continue to take all necessary precautions.

 

Sincerely,

 

Denise M. Trauth

Texas State University,5-Mar-2020," The City of San Marcos in coordination with Hays County, Texas State University, Congressman Lloyd Doggetts office, local school districts, regional and state agencies, met Wednesday, Mar. 4 to coordinate and discuss efforts underway to address Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

 While COVID-19 is not an immediate threat to our community as no cases of the virus have been confirmed in Hays County at this time, we are partnering with county-wide organizations and state public health officials to monitor trends and prepare our organizations and residents, said Rachel Ingle, the Citys Emergency Management Coordinator. 

 From todays Hays County press release, Hays County Local Health Department Epidemiologist Eric Schneider explained how the public can take preventative measures to protect themselves and their families against illness. Essentially, they are the same healthy behaviors that can prevent a flu outbreak:

 Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds several times a day, including between your fingers and underneath your nails. Handwashing is considered the best way to remove germs and dirt, and hand sanitizers should be used only when handwashing is not available. The hand sanitizers should be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective. 
Avoid handshaking and high-fives;
 Avoid touching your face  especially your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Stay home when you feel sick;
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue then put the tissue in the trash, or use the crook of your elbow if a tissue isnt available;
 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household disinfectant cleaning spray or wipe. Clean cell and desk phones, computer keyboards, door handles, and work surfaces often.
Face masks are not considered an effective way to prevent someone from catching a virus unless you have close, frequent contact with a sick person; however, they are an option for sick people to use to keep from spreading the virus;
Avoid travel to areas that have been designated high-risk areas because of multiple verified cases of COVID-19.
 The public should note that Coronaviruses are not new  some are responsible for common colds and some for more serious infections like SARS  but this particular strain of the virus is new which is why it is often referred to as Novel Coronavirus. Its formal name is Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) since 2019 was the year it was discovered.

As of March 5, no cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Hays County, and only a few individuals who believe they may have been exposed to a confirmed case are in self-quarantine and are being monitored as a precaution to protect our community, Schneider said. While we are anticipating cases to eventually show up in Hays County, the first line of defense against an outbreak or community spreading is to follow good health practices whether you are healthy or feeling sick.

 Contact your healthcare provider or the Hays County Local Health Department at 512-393-5520 if you have any questions about COVID-19 or if you are concerned that you have been exposed.  The Hays County Health Department has a monitoring protocol in place which will be explained to you if warranted.  If you are experiencing symptoms, you may be directed to your local hospital emergency room.

 For additional qualified information about COVID-19, visit the Texas Department of State Health Services or the Centers for Disease Control. For media inquiries, contact communicationsinfo@sanmarcostx.gov.",561,tex,3
Texas State University,6-Mar-2020,"
Dear University Community,

 As new cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerge and our university community prepares for spring break, I want to share some expanded travel restrictions and important updates to safeguard our faculty, staff, and students.

 As a reminder, we have launched a COVID-19 webpage as a source for critical and updated information.  Please check your Texas State email and the website to stay informed.

Situation Update

 As of this date, no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported on our San Marcos or Round Rock Campuses, or in Hays County or Williamson County.

Education Abroad Programs

 Effective immediately, all Education Abroad programs for spring break and summer are being cancelled.  We will continue to assess future programs as the situation evolves. The university is working to provide alternate options for students registered for the cancelled Education Abroad trips.  

 If you enrolled in an Education Abroad program that is being cancelled and you have questions, please call the Education Abroad Office at 512-245-1967 for assistance.

Students in Education Abroad programs in countries with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designated Travel Warning Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) have already been recalled and required to self-isolate for 14 days. 

Faculty, Staff, and Student International Travel

 University-affiliated international travel by faculty, staff, and students to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 is restricted. Approval for official university international travel for faculty, staff, and students will be evaluated on an individual case basis at the Presidents Cabinet level. 

 Faculty, staff, and students who choose to travel for personal reasons to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 will be required to self-isolate for 14 days before returning to a Texas State campus.  If a countrys warning level increases to a CDC Level 2 or 3 during the visit, the faculty, staff member, or student will also be required to self-isolate before returning to campus.  Check CDC Travel Warnings for the  latest information.

Class/Work Absence Due to Illness

 Providing a healthy, safe working, and learning environment is a priority.  It is essential that faculty, staff or students who have a potentially contagious illness stay home and not go to class or work.  Persons who appear ill and have symptoms such as cough, fever, and sneezing will be asked to leave the workplace or classroom.  Students who miss class due to illness should contact the Dean of Students office (phone: 512-245-2124) and work with their professors to discuss how to manage course work while absent.  Faculty and staff who miss work due to illness should follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.

Self-Isolation Requirements

 Faculty, staff or students required to self-isolate must follow the CDCs guidance for effective and safe isolation (How to Self-Isolate).  Self-isolation may be required by a public health authority or a medical provider.  A medical note verifying the need for isolation must be provided upon return to school or work.  Faculty or staff required by a public health authority or a medical provider to self-isolate will follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.

Personal Health and Safety

 As COVID-19 continues to spread both in the U.S. and abroad, it is important that you carefully consider where you are travelling.  Avoid areas where there is evidence of COVID-19 spreading.  Practice effective prevention measures such as staying away from those that are sick, washing your hands frequently, and staying home if you are ill.  If we work together and follow the guidance provided, we can help protect our Bobcat community.  For the latest information on COVID-19 and the universitys response measures, please check TXST COVID-19. .

Health Advisory: Novel Coronavirus and Recent Travel to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
Division of Student Affairs | January 24, 2020

The outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a new Coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) in China is being closely monitored by the CDC and World Health Organization. Cases of the illness have been reported in several other countries, including at least two confirmed cases in the U.S. Risk to the U.S. population is considered low at this time. However, any person that develops fever and signs of a respiratory illness (cough or shortness of breath) and has traveled to Wuhan, or Hubei Province, in China during the previous 14 days should seek medical care. Early symptoms could include chills, body aches, runny nose, sore throat or headache. Healthcare providers should be contacted prior to the visit to alert them to the respiratory symptoms and recent travel to China. Precautions should be taken to reduce the possible transmission of infection by covering coughs or sneezes, wearing a surgical mask, limiting contact with others and washing hands frequently. The Student Health Center is monitoring the situation and will follow any guidance provided by the CDC or state/local health department as the situation evolves.

Texas State University,18-Mar-2020,"Dear Texas State Community,

 COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States but there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Texas State campuses at this time.  The university has implemented a variety of measures to decrease the risk of exposure to our community.  International and domestic travel have been restricted.  We have increased infection control.  We are implementing social distancing. For a list of cancelled events, click here. We are sharing information about prevention, proper self-isolation, and safely seeking medical care.  Slowing the spread of COVID-19 requires that we all do our part by staying home if sick, practicing social distancing and following the instructions of our healthcare providers.

 Travel is a significant concern, especially as spring break ends.  I want to remind our campus community about the following travel policies:

 Persons returning from countries with a CDC Level 2 or 3 Travel Health Notice are required to self-isolate for 14 days before coming to a Texas State campus.  International travelers should send an email to healthcenter@txstate.edu with information about travel destination(s) and dates of travel so that we can monitor your health and provide you with medical documentation.  Information on how to self-isolate can be found at Steps for Isolating.  
 Persons traveling within the United States, especially to areas with community transmission such as Washington, California and New York state, should self-monitor and social distance for 14 days.  Temperature should be checked in the morning and afternoon daily.  Signs of illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath should be assessed daily.  Social distancing should be practiced by avoiding crowds and maintaining some distance with others while at home or work as much as  possible.  If an illness develops during the self-monitoring period, stay home and consult with your healthcare provider by phone. 
The Student Health Center is introducing Telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our patients and staff.  All patients requesting an appointment for evaluation of a respiratory illness will  have  a Telehealth visit with a medical provider first.  The medical provider may be able to provide care and treatment without a personal visit or may determine that the patient needs to come to the Health Center for further evaluation and testing.  COVID-19 testing is still limited and can only be conducted if criteria are met for testing.  Faculty, staff and students are eligible for COVID-19 testing if within the last 14 days they had:  1) direct contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or 2) recent international or domestic travel to an area with community transmission of COVID-19 and develop fever (> 100F), cough and shortness of breath.  To request an appointment, call the Student Health Center at 512-245-2161.  For more information about COVID-19, check the CDC website at Coronavirus 2019.

We  have a significant challenge ahead of us and many are understandably concerned.  Lets turn that concern into action.  Lets look out for each other and do our part!

Texas State University,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

 This is a difficult time for all of us, and it requires me to share information that I know will have a tremendous impact on our Texas State University family. To protect our students, faculty, and staff from the ongoing spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), the decision has been made to move courses to remote or alternative delivery beginning March 30 through the end of the spring semester.  

 Members of my Cabinet, other key university administrators, and I considered every aspect of this unprecedented decision and what it would mean for our students, but in the end, out of the utmost concern for everyones safety and health we reached this conclusion.

 Ensuring students can easily access their remote course material is our primary focus. All undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to complete the courses for which they are currently enrolled.  We will work to find solutions for students without off-campus access to a computer or Wi-Fi. Students who have questions or need support can contact the IT Assistant Center (ITAC).

In  accordance with national and state recommendations on social distancing, we request our students living in residence halls or in Bobcat Village Apartments return home or make other off-campus living arrangements for the remainder of the spring semester. We realize moving out of a residence hall is not an option for everyone, and are committed to being flexible for special considerations. Those who need to remain on campus will have limited access to services and facilities, such as the  LBJ Student Center and dining options. Clearly, there will be fewer opportunities for interaction due to the need for social distancing and thus the cancellation of university events and activities. The Department of Housing and Residential Life will communicate directly with on-campus residents about how to apply for an exception to remain on-campus, establish a time to retrieve belongings and move out, and the process for receiving a financial credit for housing costs.

For  Bobcats planning to graduate in May, I know you are concerned about spring commencement ceremonies. We are moving spring ceremonies to August 6 and 8 to coincide with summer commencement. An updated schedule of those ceremonies will be available soon here.  I am so proud of our students graduating in May, and look forward to celebrating that achievement with you and your families in August. It is important to remember if you are eligible to graduate at the end of this spring semester, you will still receive your degree and a diploma even if you are not able to participate in the rescheduled commencement ceremonies.

 Understandably, these developments will generate many questions from our students regarding course completion and credit, access to technology you need to learn and work remotely, and housing options. Our Texas State faculty and staff are prepared to make the transition as smooth as possible and are here to help you navigate the process. We will continue to share detailed information as we respond to COVID-19. To stay informed, check your university email often, and visit the COVID-19 webpage for the most recent updates and helpful FAQs.

 I am extremely grateful for our Texas State staff and faculty who have worked tirelessly to support our university community, and who will help us overcome the challenges ahead. I know their work is done out of dedication to and love for our Bobcat students.

 These are extraordinary times that call on the best of our Bobcat spirit, grit, compassion, and determination. I am proud to be a part of this amazing community, and your safety and well-being will continue to be my highest priority.


Be well Bobcats.

 

Sincerely,

Denise M. Trauth

Texas State University,23-Mar-2020,"
Dear Colleagues,

Every day, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 bring new challenges and decisions for us to face professionally and personally. I have seen you all meet these difficult times with perseverance, creativity, hard work, and sincere care and empathy for our students. I have never been prouder. 

To  enable Texas State University employees to comply with shelter-in-place or other restrictions that may be issued by local or state officials, we are providing the following guidance regarding managing your work schedule.  

We  recognize these shelter-in-place restrictions may eventually affect many, if not all, of our employees and students.  Texas State is committed to providing flexibility and appropriate work options that not only answer the needs of our employees, but ensure the continued operation of the university.  These extraordinary times require us to provide additional support to our students as they adapt to their changing learning and living environment. It is critical that the students on our campuses and those working remotely have access to the services and facilities they need to be successful. 

The  Presidents Cabinet has reviewed the essential offices previously identified for energy conservation and weather emergencies and adjusted the list for this situation. To meet the universitys needs, we have determined that offices identified as essential to university operations (listed at the end of this email) must have at least one full-time employee in the office on the San Marcos Campus, and as applicable, on the Round Rock Campus, during the normal 40-hour work week. The appropriate cabinet member may determine if more individuals are needed to perform the necessary work responsibilities.

All  other employees not physically on one of the campuses are expected to work remotely for 40 hours per week.  The expectation is that anyone working remotely is reachable, available, and demonstrating work outcomes. These individuals must submit the Remote and Telecommuting Work Agreement and have it approved by their supervisor. I encourage you to review the Staff and Faculty section here on the COVID-19 webpage for important information on working remotely.

We  understand that some employees for various reasons may not be able to work remotely from home. In those cases, they should plan to come to their office on our campuses and follow the work schedule as approved by their supervisor while maintaining the recommended social distancing protocol. Supervisors can also approve flexible work hours (e.g., early mornings, late evenings, and/or weekends) to accommodate our employees professional and personal needs. Temporary staff and student employees, including those on assistantships and work-study appointments, may also be extended the option to perform work from home. 

As a  reminder, university mail services will continue to operate for the remainder of the semester on the spring break schedule outlined here in the Campus Services and Support section of the COVID-19 FAQs.

 Thank you for your continued patience as we work to find the best solutions to keep our Texas State community safe and operational. I appreciate each and every one of you.

Sincerely,

The  majority of Texas State faculty and staff are working remotely, and essential personnel on the San Marcos Campus and the Round Rock Campus are following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) social distancing guidelines. Public universities are considered an essential function of state government and are required to remain open with limited on-campus staffing. Texas State President Denise Trauth provided information to employees via email on March 24 regarding university essential offices and functions.

Beginning  March 30, Texas State courses are moving to remote or alternative delivery through the end of the spring semester.

In accordance  with national recommendations on social distancing, students living in university residence halls have been asked to return home for the rest of the semester. For students who are unable to make other living arrangements, Texas State is providing special considerations. Those who remain on campus out of necessity will have limited access to services and facilities.

Texas State University,26-Mar-2020," Last night,  Hays County joined Williamson, Travis, and Bexar counties in issuing a Stay-at-Home order for residents.

 Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of state government and must remain open with essential staffing while stay-at-home orders are in place. We will continue to provide services to the more than 38,000 students enrolled in courses and to our students who continue to live on the San Marcos campus.

 Texas State has been preparing for this possibility by adjusting our remote work and telecommuting policies, encouraging flexible work schedules, revising our list of essential university offices, and working to support our employees who will be working on-site and remotely during this time.

I  encourage you to read the shelter-in-place information posted on the Faculty and Staff COVID-19 FAQ page which is being continuously updated as new information is available.  Employees may simply show their university-issued photo identification if asked why they are not sheltering in place. An essential employee card that you can print yourself is also available on the FAQ website.

Texas State University,26-Mar-2020,"Dear Students, 

 Hays County Judge Ruben Becerra has issued a Stay at Home Order for Hays County, including San Marcos, that goes into effect at 11 p.m. tonight, March 26. The order includes a curfew from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m., except for essential workers whose employment requires it. Exceptions are made for essential services and businesses. We encourage you to read the statement from Hays County. The full order is available here. Williamson County, which includes our Round Rock Campus, is also under a similar Stay At Home order.

 Texas State University supports these orders for protecting the health and wellness of our university community and the larger communities we call home. Its imperative that everyone in the Bobcat family comply for the health and safety of our entire region.

 The COVID-19 webpage Frequently Asked Questions have been updated in light of the order, including the following helpful information:

 University employees are still permitted to travel to and from campus for performing their essential work duties.
The library will remain open with modified hours with many online support services to all faculty and students. Students can still go to the library when remote courses begin Monday.
 Additionally, students who are living on campus may continue to use the library and other university facilities as an extension of their home environment, while carefully following appropriate social distancing and other prevention measures.
We will continue to provide limited on-campus dining options and shuttle services, as well as other on-campus services. Visit Campus Services and Support in the FAQs to learn more. 
 By working together, making smart choices, and complying with local and federal guidelines on prevention and mitigation, we can slow the spread of the virus.",285,tex,3
Texas State University,26-Mar-2020," Dear Colleagues,
 
 As we prepare to welcome back our students to the completion of the spring semester through remote and alternate delivery methods, I want to thank you all for your leadership during this time of unprecedented challenge.  I am very proud of the dedication you have shown to our students and each other as we have made difficult decisions to protect our community.  Now as the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more apparent, we must prepare for the reality that the events attendant to the virus will have an impact on our financial future.
 
I  strongly believe that we are doing the right thing by changing our traditional campus life to allow students to complete their courses from the safety of their homes.  The health of our students, faculty, and staff will continue to be my highest priority.  We know that these decisions will result in a loss of already budgeted funds, and it is in this context that we also must prepare for the additional financial losses we could experience in the coming weeks and months.
 
We  anticipate that our summer enrollment will be significantly less than in previous years, and that fall enrollment could also be negatively impacted.  It is prudent that we act now to conserve our resources for the future.  By acting quickly, we hope to be able to continue to provide the best possible educational environment for our students and to protect our employees.  
 
 Therefore, I have asked my Cabinet to implement the following changes to our budgets. We will temporarily delay all new personnel actions including the posting of new positions and hiring to fill vacancies.  Certain exceptions will be allowed, such as the Vice President for Student Affairs, which I consider a critical position.  Requests for exceptions will be reviewed by the appropriate Cabinet member and require my approval.  

 For the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends on August 31, 2020, I am restricting expenditures from operating budgets to 50 percent of the remaining balances.  The remaining 50 percent of the funds will be placed into savings accounts in your own budgets to provide a safety net in case these funds are needed in the next fiscal year .  
 
 Currently, all university sponsored travel is cancelled.  This policy will remain in effect until health experts indicate it is safe to travel.  We know that many faculty members are planning to submit papers and proposals for delivery at academic conferences.  Assuming the lifting of shelter-in-place restrictions, faculty members can make submissions for conferences beginning with the next academic year.  Other travelers must receive an exception given by the appropriate Cabinet member . 
 
 Since it is imperative for everyone to exercise tight fiscal controls on expenditures, additional cost savings measures in the area of facility construction have been identified and these include the delay of any renovations, improvement projects, or optional facility projects until the next fiscal year.  However, continued enhanced cleaning and routine facility repairs will be conducted as needed.  
 

I  know that you will have many questions regarding how these changes will be implemented, and I have asked Provost Gene Bourgeois and Vice President for Finance and Support Services Eric Algoe to provide further details in the coming days.  
 
 These changes will undoubtedly cause hardships and difficulty across our campuses, and I sincerely hope that many of the cost-saving measures will prove to be unnecessary in the months to come.  However, we would be remiss in our responsibilities as leaders if we do not act now.  The extraordinary challenges created by COVID-19 demand unprecedented fiscal discipline.  I will continue to keep you updated as we address this evolving situation .

 Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of state government and must remain open with essential staffing. Public transportation is also exempted from the Hays County Stay at Home Work Safe order issued March 25, 2020, as it does provide some individuals with their only access to health care, food, and other essential services.  Operating under the Stay at Home Work Safe order, Texas State continues to provide services to the more than 38,000 students enrolled in remote courses, some of whom do not have the option to move off campus and remain in our residence halls, or require the use of university facilities.   

 Bobcat Shuttle riders must comply with social distancing and other practices the university has implemented to make riding the bus as safe as possible.

Texas State University leadership is making important decisions to prioritize the health and well-being of the Bobcat Community, while continuing the essential work of running a university. 

Since these declarations may result in eligibility for COVID-19 federal funds, Texas State made changes to the e-NPO screen to track costs and seek reimbursements upon availability of funds. On each e-NPO document, select Yes or No indicating whether the expense is related to COVID-19.  Note: The form will not allow you to list both types of expenses on the same e-NPO document.

I know this is not the way any of us imagined the second half of our spring semester, but it is  what these extraordinary times require. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we have made difficult decisions to keep our campuses safe, and to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.

No matter where you are today, know that our Bobcat community remains strong, and all of  us at Texas State University are invested in your success as we adapt to a new learning environment.  

As we begin classes under stay-at-home orders from Hays County, Williamson County, and  surrounding counties, I want to emphasize that Texas State is considered an essential government agency and remains open with limited staffing to serve you. Many of our employees are working remotely, while others are practicing social distancing to keep essential offices operating on our campuses. Adhering to the stay-at-home orders is critical for the health and safety of our entire region and I encourage you to read our COVID-19 FAQs for updates and information on available services while the orders are in place.

I am very proud of how our dedicated faculty and staff have met the challenge of moving  over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery over the last two weeks. They faced this task with innovation, hard work, and determination to serve you well during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that you can easily access your remote course material and finish the semester strong is our primary focus. If you have questions or need support, please contact the IT Assistance Center (ITAC).

Not only are courses available remotely, but several of the universitys other support services such as counseling and academic advising can now be accessed online. Please take care of yourself during these stressful times and reach out to the Counseling Center if you need additional support. 

As we begin to adapt and find some comfort in our new normal, continue to keep yourself and others safe by following the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including social distancing and hygiene, as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For students who do need to physically come to our San Marcos Campus or Round Rock Campus, we have taken measures to ensure the environment is as safe as possible for you.

In my 17 years as president of Texas State, weve never experienced anything like this -- but I have also never been prouder. This challenging situation has amplified our fundamental Bobcat values of compassion, service, perseverance, and dedication. I am humbled by the actions of our health professions faculty and staff who have donated their time and equipment, including loaning ventilators to area hospitals, to help the greater cause. Our Student Affairs and Housing and Residential Life staff are working hard to help 4,000 students move from residence halls safely, or find a way to stay if they didnt have a suitable housing alternative. The Student Health Center transformed its health care delivery to include a telehealth to keep students well. Our alumni have reached out to offer encouragement and support to the university and to our students. Through kindness and hard work, our university family is making a difference, and I look forward to sharing more of these uplifting stories in the upcoming days and weeks.

Most importantly, I am impressed by each of you. I know there is apprehension and uncertainty along with disappointment for what you are missing, but I am confident in your resilience and tenacity. We are here to give you the support you need to navigate these next two months. And, for those of you who are seniors, I cant wait to celebrate commencement with you in August.

Together, we will make the best of this situation, and give new meaning to Bobcat Strong.

Stay safe and well.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to each of you for all your work over the last few weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

For more than a century, our university community has been united by the belief  that through our love of learning and our hard work, we can do great things. There is no better example than the many ways that faculty and staff are meeting these challenging times with creativity, cooperation, and a deep commitment to our students.

Every division, department, college, and program -- on both campuses -- have  moved quickly to adapt our operations in the face of great difficulty and ever-changing circumstances. 

Once we announced the decision to transition to remote instruction, staff in  several parts of the university immediately established a comprehensive set of workshops and consultations to ensure faculty were effectively supported for the transition. Faculty responded quickly, converting over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery. Academic departments, schools, and colleges are also providing training and other support services for faculty, and adopting new tools and technology to shift to remote instruction. Our IT personnel have provided support, troubleshooting, training, and new resources to help make the transition as smooth as possible.

University-wide, departments and programs are being creative and finding ways  to share their services remotely and stay connected with our students. The Student Health Center launched telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our students, faculty, and staff. Our custodians have gone above and beyond to disinfect some of the most high-traffic areas of our campuses to promote our health and wellness. Many of you have been go-to sources of information and expertise for reporters, students, and fellow academics regarding the pandemic and its impact on society. I also applaud the work of Academic Affairs, planning the logistics of moving more than 5,000 soon-to-be graduates from our May commencement ceremonies into August ceremonies. There are countless stories to tell about the hard work that has taken place here -- stories we plan to share far and wide in the coming weeks.

While all this work has been happening behind-the-scenes, everyone in our Bobcat  community has juggled the needs of their loved ones, families, friends, and children. Many of you have children who are out of school, or parents and family members who are elderly or have preexisting medical conditions. All of this brings added fear and anxiety into our Bobcat community. I want to take a moment to recognize how difficult it has been for everyone, and thank you for your contributions during this trying time. Youve worked hard to stay student-centered and I am incredibly grateful for your support and dedication.

Its also important to recognize the critical work of people outside our university but integral in our community -- healthcare workers, civil service employees, sanitation workers, first responders, journalists, grocery workers, nonprofit workers and volunteers, military personnel, utility workers, and mail carriers. Many people in our university community have loved ones who have worked around-the-clock in these essential roles. We owe them a debt of gratitude as well.

Today, I also sent a message to all of our students to reiterate we are here to support them as they navigate the rest of this semester, and to remind them of services that remain available thanks to the hard work and creativity of our staff and faculty.

The  university has shared several messages with you over the last week pertaining to what the recent stay-at-home orders mean for university operations, how public universities are required to remain open with limited on-campus staffing, and staffing for essential offices. If you have any questions, I encourage you to speak with your supervisor. 

While  many of you are continuing your daily work remotely, we know there are employees whose jobs and responsibilities require them to be on-campus. To express our gratitude, we are providing a free to-go lunch daily on both campuses. Look for an email from Dining Services for all the details on how to enjoy a delicious and convenient meal every day that you are on campus.

In closing, please know I share this message of thanks on behalf of the entire Presidents Cabinet. We are all moving into uncharted territory together, but because of the caliber of our faculty and staff, I know that we will continue to provide a top-tier education and student experience, while living up to our values. Thats what makes Texas State so special.

 

Sincerely,

 

Denise M. Trauth

Texas State University,27-Mar-2020,"
 Today, the university learned that a  faculty member in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19.  The faculty member became ill during spring break on 3/17/20 while away from the San Marcos university campus. Subsequently, the individual was seen by a primary care provider who later confirmed a positive COVID-19 test result.  The faculty member, who lives in Austin, is recovering well and a full recovery is expected.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials.  

The faculty member was on campus on March 9th and 11th before the universitys spring break.  The faculty member was completely asymptomatic while on campus.  After consulting with the local public health authority, it has been determined that the risk of transmission to others on March 9th and 11th was very low.  Since the faculty member has not returned to campus since March 11th, and it is past the 14-day incubation period, the public health authority is not recommending any specific measures be taken by the university at this time.  

As COVID-19 continues to spread across  our country, it is important that everyone follow local directives for social distancing or shelter-in-place, and adhere to CDC guidance on prevention measures such as staying away from those who are sick, washing hands frequently - especially before touching your face or eating, and staying home if ill.  These are difficult times and I hope all are healthy and safe. Lets keep doing our part to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Texas State University,27-Mar-2020,"Bobcats, we know you are excited to register for summer and fall 2020 courses. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we are delaying the start of summer and fall registration by one week to April 6.

In this ever-changing environment, we want to be sure we have enough time to make decisions that are best for your safety, your education and your future. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we plan for the future.

Registration for Summer and Fall 2020 begins at 7:00 am on April 6, 2020.

Time tickets are assigned based on classification (e.g., senior, junior) but also divided into time slots based on overall hours earned as of Monday, March 2, 2020.  Time Ticket Information.  To find out what times you qualify for, log in to Texas State Self Service.

Reminders:

Check if you have  holds that will prevent you from registering.
Contact your advising center to make sure you are taking the right classes.

If you receive a Registration Error, learn how to respond to it so you are able to register.",184,tex,3
Texas State University,31-Mar-2020,"As part of  the transition to remote instruction for the spring 2020 semester, Texas State University will make a temporary change to the final grades policy. This change will provide students with the option to request modification of final course grades to the EP (emergency pass) grades. The modification request may only be utilized for courses in which the student earned a passing grade. See the University Registrars definition of grades: https://www.registrar.txstate.edu/our-services/grades.html.

The decision  to allow this flexibility is in direct response to the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19. The universitys remote courses will continue to maintain the highest quality standards. Students are expected to participate in class activities, assessments, and assignments throughout the remainder of the semester. As usual, faculty members will assign final grades to students using the criteria and performance standards outlined for the course. 

Once final  spring 2020 semester grades are posted, students will have until Monday, May 25, 2020 to submit a written modification request to their professor(s) requesting an EP grade. Upon approval, the professor will make the grade change. To be considered, all requests must be made in writing to the professor by the stated deadline. The modification request option is limited to spring 2020 courses only. Students make requests on a course-by-course basis.

Students are  encouraged to consider the consequences of an EP grade, including those for prerequisite course requirements, GPA calculations, GPA minimums for certain programs, academic standing, admission to other programs or universities, financial aid, veterans benefits, scholarships, and other academic matters. Students should contact their academic advisor or academic program coordinator for specific questions. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to consult with their graduate advisor about the impacts of an EP grade before seeking a modification request.

Faculty members  are encouraged to be flexible but have the authority to make their own decisions on these requests. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/.

Students may appeal  a faculty members decision using the procedures outlined for the department, school, or college in which the course is taught. The appeal process is applicable for all grades, including those under review by this temporary change to the final grades policy.

I realize this has not  been an easy transition and thank you for your patience and understanding as we assess options and make decisions in the best interest of the university community.",410,tex,3
Texas State University,1-Apr-2020,"Laboratory-based  science is an important component of our research mission at Texas State University.  Circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic now require us to work together to temporarily restrict access to laboratories on the Texas State campuses for the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students, and to comply with the stay-at-home directives now in place throughout Central Texas.  On March 27 we shared some initial guidance, and now we are providing information on implementing the restriction. 

The Stay-at-Home/Work  Safe order issue by Hays County and Williamson County prevents individuals from leaving their homes except for purposes of essential activities or to perform or obtain services from an essential business, essential governmental function, or critical infrastructure.  Regarding universities, there is language allowing for essential activities that include performing critical research, or performing essential administrative functions.  Based on these orders all university research laboratories at Texas State are restricted from access except for individuals performing essential tasks.

Understandably there are questions as to what constitutes essential research activities. First, all research at Texas State is important so that alone is not the benchmark for defining essential.  Also, it is true that a pause in routine research activity will have consequences regarding collection of data, publication of research results, and other usual benchmarks of progress.  So, while very unfortunate, a disruption of these types of outcomes is not synonymous with essential in the present context.   

It is impossible to provide a definition of essential that will cover the unique circumstances  for all research activities at Texas State.  One example of performing an essential function is an individual who enters a research laboratory for a brief visit to assure that there are no issues related to the equipment or other components of the facility.  This is very different from going into the facility to conduct experiments and collect data which, in general, would not be considered an essential activity.  In rare cases, a more ongoing activity may be approved as essential (see below).

For the duration of the stay-at-home orders and other precautions in place related to the  coronavirus outbreak, the goal is to have an intentional change in activity from a business as usual mode to focusing only on critical functions in the laboratory. 

So, without trying to be fully inclusive or exclusive, research laboratory access is limited to  a very small number of personnel who maintain essential research-related actions that include:

performing a brief walk-through of the laboratory to make sure that everything is OK.
activity that if discontinued immediately would generate significant data and sample loss.
activity that if discontinued would pose a safety hazard.
activity that keeps critical equipment and infrastructure in facilities and laboratories safe or avoids catastrophic loss.
activity that maintains critical samples, reagents, and materials.
activity that maintains animal populations.
activity that maintains critically-needed plant populations, tissue cultures, bacteria, archaea, and other living organisms.
COVID-19 related activity that has a timeline for deployment that could address the crisis.
activity in support of essential human subjects research.
Also, as we have indicated in previous communications, students cannot be compelled to participate in research laboratory-based activities, even those identified as essential.  In no case may there be academic or professional retribution against students who decide not to participate in such activities during this time.

Please act immediately to transition laboratories to restricted access.  The restricted access mode should  be fully in place by Monday, April 6.  If any essential activity is planned beyond intermittent brief walk-throughs, you will need approval of the planned activity from Dr. Michael Blanda, Assistant Vice President for Research, who will review requests in conjunction with the Chief Research Officer.  Please contact Dr. Blanda via email at blanda@txstate.edu.

Thank you for your understanding and leadership during these unprecedented circumstances.",626,tex,4
Texas State University,1-Apr-2020,"I  hope everyone is doing well and adapting to remote and alternative course delivery for the spring semester. Texas State University is here to support our current and future Bobcats during this time of disruption. Im pleased to announce today that we are providing emergency financial aid and adjusting the delivery of Summer I courses to better meet your needs during the COVID-19 crisis.

To  make summer 2020 courses at Texas State as accessible as possible while ensuring the continued safety of our students, faculty, and staff, we will move scheduled class sections that start meeting at any point in June to online/remote delivery, and return to face-to-face and online classroom delivery for the Summer II session (July 6 - August 5). Please note that the decision regarding the Summer II session could change according to public health advice and conditions.

Making the  decision now to move Summer I to online/remote delivery gives you the ability to plan accordingly for the future during these still uncertain times, and allows students to continue toward reaching their educational goals.

I want to be  clear: Summer courses are not canceled, only moved to online/remote delivery for the Summer I session.

Registration for the Summer and Fall 2020 semesters will open on April 6, 2020.

Here is what you need to know about moving Summer I courses to online/remote delivery:

Texas State University,3-Apr-2020,"Let me begin by  acknowledging the tremendous efforts by our faculty, staff, and students in making the first week of remote instruction a success.  As we end this historic week, I wanted to answer several questions, highlight resources, and provide reassurance that the university is here to support you every step of the way.

Academic Freedom

Texas State University  affirms its commitment to academic freedom and will take steps to ensure intellectual independence, free investigation, and unfettered communication by the academic community.  President Trauth and I reaffirmed this commitment at our monthly PAAG meeting with Faculty Senate a few days ago.  Through our core values, Texas State protects and celebrates academic freedom in an atmosphere of integrity, respect, civility, and compassion.  Faculty Senates Academic Freedom Committee provides more information on this fundamental tenet in higher education: https://www.txstate.edu/facultysenate/committees/freedom.html.

Academic Integrity

With the sudden transition  to remote instruction, many faculty are concerned about ensuring academic integrity in the new environment.  Fortunately, the university has several options for gaining more information, including the video, Prompt Preparation for 100% Online Instruction and the University Honor Code, a 15-minute guide to proactively influence academic integrity in an online course.  In conjunction with the Honor Code Council, Faculty Development will offer a workshop and Q&A period, Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, on Wednesday, April 8, 2020 from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. via Zoom.  Go here to learn more and sign up for this interactive session: https://signup.txstate.edu/sessions/6035-4-8-2020-their-cheating-hearts-tips-for-maintaining-academic-integrity-while-teaching-remotely. 

Classroom Recordings

Faculty members have asked  about posting the recordings of online class sessions where student participation occurred.  These recordings reflect the teaching and learning process, so instructors often post them for students to watch or re-watch.  If access to the recordings is securely limited to other students in the same class section, student privacy protections do not limit or prevent access and do not require obtaining a written consent.  Faculty may post these recordings in TRACS or Canvas class sites that are protected by student identification and authentication features.  The recordings may not be distributed by anyone, including students, to third-parties without obtaining written consent from the instructor, students, and other participants.

Community of Practice

Every Friday at 12:00 noon Faculty Development is hosting Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty members to visit, exchange ideas, and find ways to take care of each other, ourselves, and our students as we navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning.  Topics are based on faculty suggestions.  The topic for Friday, April 3, 2020 is We Made It! This come-and-go Zoom session is time to share what is working in your classes and to hear ideas on best practices for surviving and thriving in this new learning environment.  This lunchtime gathering will be informal, informative, and fun. Join here on Fridays through May 8, 2020 at 12:00 noon: https://txstate.zoom.us/meeting/register/vJclcumrrz4iVcPlJrf-D7D2np1OYGrZqw

Copyright

Faculty own the coursework  they create, and the university has a license to use it for education and marketing purposes.  If you wish to restrict use of class materials and lectures, including recordings, written instructions should be provided to students.  See more information on copyright provisions and a suggested written statement to students (section 03.01) in AA/PPS 02.03.01, Commercial Use of Class Notes and Materials.  Additional information on copyright and remote teaching is available from the universitys Copyright Office and the librarys remote course support webpage. 

Finding Time to Read, Write, and Think

If faculty are trying to carve out  space for thinking, reading, writing, and other deep work, join Faculty Developments new program, Write Watchers. The group will meet via Zoom every Tuesday, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon, beginning on April 7, 2020.  In a Write Watcher session, each participant sets goals at the beginning and then reflects on what was accomplished at the end. In between, microphones are muted and faculty do deep work, with other supportive faculty working alongside them.  To join, follow this Zoom link on Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m.:https://txstate.zoom.us/my/writewatchers.

Zoom-bombing

A few faculty members have  reported instances of Zoom-bombing, where an uninvited person accesses and disrupts a Zoom class session, often using inappropriate language and graphics. Visit ITACs helpful resource on how to lockdown Zoom sessions to avoid unwanted visitors: https://itac.txstate.edu/support/online-meetings/lockdown.html.  Remember the first rule of Zoom: Dont give up control of your screen. 

Next week, I will provide updates  on other questions, including those related to EP grades, professional development requirements for faculty teaching online this summer, the employee assistance program, student evaluations of teaching, and the tenure clock for tenure-track faculty. Until then, I hope you and your loved ones are well.

Texas State University,3-Apr-2020,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

Today the university learned that a student in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19 on March 30, 2020.  The student came back to campus with a parent to move out of the residence hall on March 27, 2020.  The student was asymptomatic at that time and did not have close contact with anyone other than the parent.  The student has had only mild symptoms thus far and we hope for a quick and complete recovery.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials. 

The  Department of Housing and Residential Life developed a phased move-out process as a social distancing measure to reduce the risk of close or prolonged contact between persons during the move-out process.  Since the student was asymptomatic and had no close contact with anyone on campus besides the mother, the risk of exposure to others was very low.  It has been determined that no particular actions are necessary at this time.  However, this notice is being sent to comply with the requirements of the Clery Act.

Under  the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), institutions are required to immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation occurring on the campus that involves an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees. The Clery Act includes the outbreak of a serious illness as a significant emergency. Although this specific case does not rise to the level of significant emergency, the university is erring on the side of caution and acting in the spirit of the Clery Act.  Consistent with guidance from the Department of Education, Texas State will carefully analyze any subsequent or additional COVID-19 incidents on a case-by-case basis and will issue additional reports only if other significant factors call for a follow-up notification.

Sincerely,

Emilio Carranco, M.D., M.S.

Texas State University,8-Apr-2020,"Dear Round Rock Students, 

 You may be aware that Williamson County, including our Round Rock Campus, is under a Stay-At-Home order through 11:59 p.m. on April 30, 2020. The order was issued by Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell and is intended to help control the spread of COVID-19 by keeping people isolated at home. I encourage you to read the statement from Williamson County and the full order. 

 Texas State University supports this order for protecting the health and wellness of our university community and the larger communities we call home. Its imperative that everyone in the Bobcat family comply with the directive for the health and safety of our entire region.

 While this order is in effect, students should not come to the Round Rock Campus. As you know, courses are being provided by remote or alternative delivery through the remainder of the spring semester. If you have questions about your individual program, contact your faculty supervisor for specific information. The university is working with accrediting and certification authorities to address program academic guidelines moving forward and will provide updates when available. 

Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of government and will continue to operate with limited staffing during the Stay-At-Home order to serve our students. Many of our employees are working remotely and are reachable via email to address your questions and concerns.  I encourage you to visit the Texas State COVID-19 webpage for information and updates.

Texas State University,10-Apr-2020,"As we end our second week of remote instruction, this message provides responses to feedback and questions received by my office on matters related to Texas States COVID-19 response. This weeks roundup begins with four decisions that were made after consulting the Faculty Senate and academic leadership.

EP Grades
The university has implemented a one-time process for spring 2020 that allows students to request that a final passing grade be changed to Emergency Pass, or EP, upon approval of the instructor of record. Students are responsible for submitting written modification requests to faculty by Monday, May 25, at 5:00 p.m. and for assessing the impact of EP grades on their GPAs, program requirements, financial aid eligibility, and other academic factors. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/. Faculty are encouraged to check with their chair or director for any questions regarding EP grades. Information resources include the provosts March 31, 2020 email and FAQ for students.

Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online
The Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL), along with staff in Information Technology (ITAC) and Faculty Development, will support faculty re-designing courses for distance learning for the summer I term. AA/PPS No. 02.03.20 Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program. By mid-April, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from ODEL about how to access the program.

Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in professional development for online instruction. For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program. Questions may be directed to the Office of Distance and Extended Learning at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceed@txstate.edu. 

Student Evaluations of Teaching
Weve received questions about the effect of remote instruction and other changes on student evaluations of teaching for spring 2020 courses. Faculty will have the discretion to include or exclude spring 2020 results in their annual evaluation documents and tenure and promotion files, without prejudice. Faculty, chairs, directors, personnel committees, and other evaluators are encouraged to review spring 2020 student evaluation of teaching results for the purposes of professional growth. This is an opportune time to reinforce a long-term and holistic assessment of teaching effectiveness via peer observations, student learning outcomes, artifacts of learning, philosophy of teaching statements, syllabi review, and other means.

Tenure Clock for Tenure-Track Faculty
The COVID-19 pandemic has created circumstances that may impact productivity of tenure-track faculty who have a mandatory and limited probationary period before the tenure and promotion decision. These circumstances may warrant a request to toll the tenure clock. See section 03.01.g of AA/PPS, 04.02.20, Tenure and Promotion Review for more information. The policy is being updated to reflect these circumstances, as well.

Tenure-track faculty are advised to consult with their chair, director, and others before making a request to toll the tenure clock. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure and promotion review is scheduled for the next academic year (FY21) may make a request no later than May 31, 2020. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure review occurs in FY22 or later have until May 31, 2021 to make a request. The request memo originates with the faculty member and requires approval by the chair/director, dean, provost, and vice chancellor for academic and health affairs at the Texas State University System. Contact Tammy Sharp, director, faculty and academic resources, for more information: tsharp@txstate.edu or 512.245.2475.

Academic Integrity
 In response to strong faculty interest, Texas State held a workshop on academic integrity in remote instruction earlier this week. See Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, including an extensive Q&A session, here: https://mediaflo.txstate.edu/hapi/v1/contents/permalinks/Dm43NrZi/view. Closed captioning is enabled for the video.

Community of Practice
 Over the past few weeks, faculty have sought ways to stay connected, move projects forward, and strengthen professional relationships. Make plans to join Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty to exchange ideas about ways to navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning and Write Watchers to carve out time and space for thinking, reading, writing, and other completing deep work.

Employee Assistance Program  Bobcat Balance
 The university offers a comprehensive set of employee assistance services through the Bobcat Balance program. All faculty, staff and graduate student employees in benefits-eligible positions, along with members of their households, are eligible to use the program. The program includes resources and services related to personal finances, child care, elder care, legal matters, health and wellness, and other areas. Please explore this valuable employee benefit.

Supporting Students During Uncertain Times
 Many students feel especially vulnerable at this time. Beyond changes to instruction, some students have moved back home, lost jobs, or are caring for young children and family members. The College Transition Collaborative provides advice on communicating with students with clarity and compassion. Texas States Counseling Center has a COVID-19 resource page, including a webinar on April 17, 2020 to support student resilience and success.

 Next Friday, I will provide updates on questions and decisions that emerge during our third week of remote instruction. Keep up the outstanding work! I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy.

Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online

 AA/PPS No. 02.03.20  Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program.  Soon, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from the Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL) about how to access the program.  Other participants are welcome, including those who completed the program in the past.  Questions may be directed to ODEL at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceedu@txstate.edu.

 Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in the professional development program.  For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program.  Some faculty scheduled to teach during Summer I may not yet have a netID.  These faculty are still required to meet the requirement and will need guest accounts in Canvas until their net IDs arrive.  Their names, along with a request to add them to Canvas as a guest user, may be sent to distanceed@txstate.edu.

Texas State University,23-Apr-2020,"Faculty and Staff,

 While social distancing, hand-washing and staying home if sick remain the most important strategies for slowing the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  Based on this CDC recommendation, Texas State University is encouraging faculty, staff and students working on campus whose work makes it difficult to maintain social distancing to use cloth facemasks.  Employees can purchase their own cloth facemask through a variety of online retailers or in the TSUS marketplace, or find many easy do-it-yourself mask-making guides online such as those provided by the CDC at Cloth Face Coverings.  Surgical masks or respirators should be reserved for medical professionals, public safety officials and laboratory environments.

 The university has secured approximately 2,000 cloth facemasks for employees who cannot obtain one from other sources, and will provide up to two cloth facemasks upon request.  Facemasks may be picked up at the University Distribution Center located at 305 River Ridge Parkway in San Marcos, Texas or can be delivered by requesting them using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form.  When using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form, select Other for Item Needed and enter Facemask in the next field to identify the item needed.  In the Number of Cartons Needed field, enter the names and employee ID numbers of up to 5 employees in the same office.  For those wanting to pick up facemasks, please call the University Distribution Center at 512-245-2294 to get a time for pick up between 8am -12 pm or 1pm - 5pm. 

 Asymptomatic persons infected with COVID-19 can unknowingly spread infection.  Facemasks can help reduce the risk of spreading infection to others.  It is important to review these Facemask Use and Care guidelines to learn how to properly use, store and clean re-usable cloth facemasks.  Improper use of a face mask reduces its safety benefits and increases the risk of exposure.  If deemed appropriate, department supervisors may want to review this information with their employees.

Texas State University,23-Apr-2020," Texas State University announces the Bobcat Cares program to provide funds directly to currently enrolled and eligible students with COVID-19 related expenses, emergency grants to all students enrolled in summer courses, pro-rated refunds of certain spring semester charges, and a new scholarship to cover fee and tuition costs for the fall 2020 semester.  

 The $30 million in student assistance includes over $15 million in federal emergency funding from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the CARES Act. The CARES allocation will help Texas State students deal with the financial burden caused by the COVID-19 crisis and assist with the costs of attending college by providing money directly to them.

For many of our students, the financial insecurity brought on by COVID-19 is an overwhelming burden, said Texas State University President Denise Trauth. I want to thank the members of our Texas Congressional delegation for their support of the CARES Act and the help it is providing our students. Our goal is to get this money to them as quickly as possible to help meet their immediate needs so they can focus on continuing their education at Texas State.

 Currently enrolled full-time and part-time students can apply to the university for funding to offset expenses incurred related to housing, food, and technology and course materials. Beginning April 27, students can complete a brief online application showing their need for the funds. The emergency grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, and the funding is not tied to existing financial aid programs such as the Pell grant. The money will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.

 In addition to the CARES Act funds, Texas State has identified $5 million to provide all students enrolled in funded courses during Summer I and/or Summer II classes a one-time emergency grant equal to $50 per credit hour up to $600 across both summer sessions. The grant funding will be in the form of a credit to student accounts to reduce the cost of summer courses.

 For students currently enrolled in the spring semester, the university is issuing more than $10 million in pro-rated refunds and credits for on-campus housing for those who moved from university residence halls to slow the spread of the coronavirus, parking fees, and dining. In addition, students employed through the Federal and State Work Study programs who have been unable to work onsite or remotely due to the COVID-19 situation will receive emergency grants.

 To support students enrolling in the fall 2020 semester, the university created the new Bobcats to Bobcats scholarship fund with a goal of providing $1 million to help students pay for tuition and fees as they continue their education.

I want our students and their families to know their safety is our top priority, and we are just as committed to helping them gain financial security in these very uncertain times. Texas State will do everything in our power to support our students during this difficult time so that they can continue to pursue the education and careers they desire, Trauth said.",519,tex,4
Texas State University,24-Apr-2020,"As we close the fourth week of remote instruction, I want to highlight the positive innovations that continue to result from Texas State Universitys strategic and values-based response to COVID-19.  Thank you for your significant commitment to ensuring a healthy and successful spring semester for all.

Bobcat Cares

 On Thursday, April 23, 2020, President Denise M. Trauth announced the launch of Bobcat Cares to help ease the financial strain many Texas State University students are experiencing.  This program provides funds directly to eligible students with COVID-19 related expenses, emergency grants to all 
students enrolled in summer courses, pro-rated refunds of certain spring semester charges, and a new scholarship to assist with fee and tuition costs for the fall 2020 semester.

 Students may apply for the Bobcat Cares funding beginning April 27, 2020.  The emergency grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19 and will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.

Texas State University,1-May-2020," In preparation to resume in-person teaching for classes held during the second summer session beginning July 6 and the fall 2020 semester, Texas State University has established several pandemic and post-pandemic work groups to address areas related to safety, learning and university operations.

 During the current spring semester in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Texas State transitioned more than 5,200 courses to remote delivery on March 30, and approximately 5,000 students moved from the San Marcos Campus. The university has remained open with essential staffing through the spring semester, supporting students virtually and on campuses. More than 80 percent of faculty and staff are working remotely to sustain university operations.  Summer I classes (June 1-July 1) will continue to be delivered remotely with plans for students returning to the university on July 6 for the summer II session.

 As we anticipate returning to face-to-face instruction for summer II classes and the fall semester, we are working to adapt university operations to ensure we have a safe, healthy learning and working environment for our students, faculty and staff, said Texas State President Denise Trauth. When we return to in-person instruction, we are preparing to operate in a very different environment. I have established five work groups to create a university-wide plan that will drive the actions we will take to mitigate risks, deliver quality education, and protect our university community.

 In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, uncertainty abounds. Texas State University is committed to entering the unchartered waters wisely. Together, we have the knowledge, creativity, and ingenuity to face challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis and come out of this situation stronger and better than ever,  Trauth said.

Recommendations from the work groups will be reviewed by the Presidents Cabinet by June 15 with a university plan ready for implementation July 1.",302,tex,5
Texas State University,1-May-2020,"

Throughout it all, I have been inspired by the numerous displays of cooperation, transparency, and innovation as we swiftly adapted to the challenges of COVID-19.  Among other initiatives, the university continues to implement plans that bolster student success, enhance the teaching and learning environment, and prepare all of us for a resilient and safe future.

Bobcat Cares

Texas State University,11-May-2020,"Dear Bobcats,

 When the decision was made to move classes to remote delivery after spring break to protect our Texas State University community from the spread of the coronavirus, we also decided to postpone spring commencement to August 6 and 8, 2020, to coincide with August 7, 2020, summer ceremonies.

 The commencement feasibility work group, which included student representatives, faculty senators, a dean representative, the registrar, the commencement coordinator, the associate vice president for academic affairs, and the chief medical officer, has searched for the safest options to hold commencement events for more than 6,000 graduates and their families and friends over three days of ceremonies. After exhausting every possible scenario, we have made the hard decision that it will not be possible to hold in-person commencement ceremonies in August 2020 for spring and summer graduates while adhering to the required social distancing measures. Instead, we will share virtual commencement ceremonies on August 6, 7, and 8, 2020.

 As President, Commencement is my favorite time of year. Like many of you, I am disappointed that we cannot come together in person to celebrate this special occasion. However, I take comfort in knowing that we are doing the right thing to protect our Bobcat family and the greater San Marcos community.

 I know this may feel like a diminished experience, but by no means does it lessen the accomplishments of our graduates. Commencement is important because it is the ceremony to celebrate and formally recognize the degrees you have earned as graduates of Texas State University.  No matter what form commencement takes, those degrees are yours now, and for the rest of your lives.

 Planning is underway to ensure we have a very special experience to honor our graduates during a virtual commencement. We want to honor our brave students who persevered and graduated despite the disruption caused by the pandemic.

 To our graduates, I offer you a sincere and heartfelt congratulations. Your dedication and tenacity have shown the world what it means to be a Bobcat.

Sincerely,

Denise M. Trauth

Texas State University,18-May-2020,"
Dear Texas State University Community,

 In my May 1, 2020 email to the Texas State University community about our preparation to resume in-person teaching for summer II classes and the fall semester, I outlined several work groups established to create a plan that protects the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff as they return to live, learn, and work on our campuses.

 These work groups are comprised of more than 120 faculty, staff, and students representing a broad range of departments, expertise, professions, and voices. It is this diversity in thought and experience that will ensure our return to in-person instruction will address the safety and educational needs of our community. 

 I originally established five work groups, but that number has grown to eight to make our effort even more comprehensive. At the end of this email, you will find an explanation of each work group and a list of the members assigned to the group.

 The work group chairs will deliver preliminary recommendations to the Presidents Cabinet on May 22, 2020. Following that presentation, we will update the university community on their recommendations and lay out the process for implementing their recommendations. 

 There has never been a more serious charge for our Texas State community. I appreciate the diligence and dedication I have seen from the work groups as they approach this challenging task. Together, we will navigate the details of returning to classes and to our campuses with the upmost safety.

University of Central Florida,21-May-2020,"As we are all adjusting to the different realities of COVID-19, my attention has been on ensuring that UCF’s mission of serving our students, scholars and state continues unabated.

In navigating the uncertainties of the pandemic and focusing on achieving operational excellence across the institution, strong and consistent leadership of our academic enterprise will be crucial to our success. This will provide us stability during a time when change and uncertainty have become a new normal.

To help us move forward, I have asked Dr. Michael Johnson to serve as our interim provost and vice president for Academic Affairs for the next two years, anticipating that we would launch a national search no earlier than Fall 2021.

Dr. Johnson’s strong institutional knowledge has been invaluable as I have transitioned to UCF. He is a leader of the highest integrity who has earned the respect of those across campus during his 30-year tenure here.

As we continue to navigate the year ahead, Dr. Johnson will be an instrumental partner in creating positive change, strengthening our academic and research programs and providing leadership to enterprise-level initiatives that will make us more effective and transparent, such as the redesign of our budget model. Dr. Johnson also will help ensure that voices across the university — particularly those of our faculty — are more involved in decision-making.

Our institutional planning requires our best collective thinking to engage in creative and compelling ways that will help UCF emerge stronger.

I am appreciative of the teams across the university that have come together to help with our plans to move forward during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the active engagement from the Faculty Senate earlier this week, and the groups, such as departments’ Human Resources advisors, who have shared their questions and have provided guidance to our planning efforts.

As we plan for the slow return of faculty, staff and eventually our students to campus, in all of our decisions, we will continue to prioritize our community’s health and well-being and provide more opportunities for your input and questions before we share our plans with the Florida Board of Governors next month. We also will continue sharing more information on UCF’s evolving practices and protocols both via email and on the university’s coronavirus website.

Additional Leadership Updates
We will soon begin our national searches for our chief financial officer and chief operations officer, as well as a third national search for a new chief information officer coinciding with Dr. Joel Hartman’s retirement on July 1.

For all three searches, I am committed to an inclusive process with representation from across the university, including faculty, staff, students and administrators. I also hope to engage community leaders, alumni and partners who have expertise in these administrative areas.

A Culture of Inclusion and Diversity
Closely aligned with decisions on leadership and strengthening our operations is a focus on UCF’s culture, specifically our strong commitment to inclusion and diversity.

One of the reasons I was attracted to UCF is because of the great pride we take in the depth and breadth of the diversity among our employees and student body, which is approaching majority minority, as well as our Hispanic-serving designation.

One thing already is clear to me: We must have an executive at the highest level who is focused on how we can become more inclusive and diverse across our entire campus, including in our leadership roles, and in our connections to the community. I am working closely with our Interim Chief Equity, Inclusion and Diversity Officer Dr. Kent Butler to review the results of our recent campus climate survey and develop a high-level plan for investing in UCF’s inclusion and diversity initiatives.

As we continue to move forward, I will be sharing more information with you about our next steps for our open leadership searches and opportunities for us to engage digitally — all of which are geared toward helping UCF become even more exceptional in our academics, operations and service.

Thank you for your commitment to working together to “Charge On” through an unusual summer and in planning for a different type of fall.

All the best,

Alexander N. Cartwright, Ph.D.
President",696,fl,5
University of Central Florida,20-May-2020,"COVID-19 has impacted all of us in some way. The disruptions shut down most of our research operations in March, and I know you have been eagerly awaiting word on when you can get back. I appreciate your patience.

Since April, I have been working with a dedicated team of faculty researchers, administrators and others to put together a plan for you to return to your laboratories. The task force’s main objective was to keep everyone as safe as possible, while increasing research activity in a phased approach. We also adopted several principles to keep us focused on your needs. The phased approach enhances safety and also gives the university the flexibility to scale up or down as changes in the pandemic necessitate.

If you can conduct your research remotely, please continue to do so. For others, we will begin the phased return to laboratories tomorrow, Thursday, May 21.

There will be several things you need to do before you can walk into your lab. In addition to wearing face coverings while on campus, observing physical distancing and washing hands often, there are six steps to getting access and keeping access during this time.

The Basics
Everyone in your research lab must wear face coverings while on campus. This includes getting to and from your lab, inside your lab (in addition to any face coverings your research requires that you wear) and in any shared common spaces, including elevators. If your research team includes students, they too, must wear face coverings and remain 6 feet apart from each other, while also regularly washing hands after completing each task, and after touching doors and shared surfaces.

Limited Supplies
As you can imagine, personal protective equipment is in high demand. If you have the necessary face coverings for your team and cleaning supplies to ensure your lab is disinfected, we ask that you use those supplies first.

If you do not have what you need, please call 407-882-7111. UCF’s Department of Emergency Management, with support from Resource Management, is working to source PPE, track requests and disburse items based on need.

Because safety is our priority, you may not enter your lab until you can secure these basic items. With these supplies in hand, you can move onto the six steps to access your lab.

Six Steps for Lab Access
Receive authorization from your Associate Dean of Research to gain access to your lab. Authorization is based on the research activity tiers. Currently, limited activities in Tiers 1-4 have been authorized.
Complete required training. This includes any outstanding EHS training, as well as new training prepared specifically for COVID-19. Log in through EHS portal.
Plan and prepare written safety procedures for your lab, including how you will clean and disinfect areas. The procedures must be clearly displayed in the lab using the COVID-19 Laboratory Restart form.
Schedule no more than 1 person per 200-square-feet at any given time, unless there are different safety requirements. The same is true for personnel using any office space linked to your lab.
Keep a copy of the weekly schedule of all lab personnel to help track any potential exposure, should that become necessary.
All people entering the lab must complete daily check-in and check-out forms.
Human Subject Research
We did not forget about all of our researchers working with human subjects. Your work is equally important, but presents additional challenges amid this pandemic.

All research involving face-to-face interaction that could not be done via a different mechanism such as phone, Skype or Zoom was halted on April 10 because of the increased risk to the researchers and subjects. The temporary IRB protocol revisions are still in effect for now.

The task force is working with the Institutional Review Board to create an approach tailored to your needs. More information about the next steps will be coming soon.

We know these requirements may seem daunting, but they are necessary to help enhance your safety and the safety of those around you.

We trust that everyone will comply with these new requirements, but we are aware that there may be a few who decide to ignore or fail to follow the rules. We also understand that some of you may be uncomfortable speaking up in those circumstances. The Integrity Line at 1-855-877-6049 or ucfintegrityline.com offers an opportunity to share your concerns anonymously.

Please continue to pay attention to your email for additional updates from the Office of Research. Additional emails about broader return to campus plans, including policies about safety during COVID-19 and enforcement, will be coming soon.

You can find all the information pertaining to this announcement for lab researchers at corona.research.ucf.edu.

Rest assured we didn’t create this system to make life difficult. Restarting research is a unique challenge for all of us, and there are bound to be hiccups. I ask you for your continued patience as we move through this process. We created this system to keep you safe and let us all get back to one of our core missions at UCF — conducting research that makes an impact. Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions.

Thanks again for your patience, understanding and cooperation during these trying times.

University of Central Florida,13-May-2020,"As businesses and other entities across the state begin bringing back employees, UCF soon will as well, with a phased-in approach for faculty and staff returning to campus.

Since last month, teams from across the university have been working on what our return to the workplace, research labs, classrooms and campus life would look like. In all of our planning, we are prioritizing the safety of our entire campus community and following guidance from public health officials and Governor DeSantis’ plan for reopening Florida.

These measures will begin later this month for researchers who require access to their labs. They will receive detailed direction from the Office of Research with updates on how they and others will be able to operate in labs across campus and in the Central Florida Research Park. While it is critical that our research enterprise continues, we must do so safely with new procedures and physical distancing practices.

Over the next two weeks, campus leadership and supervisors will receive additional guidance for how we will pilot a slow return to work across campus beginning June 1. Working with your supervisor, individuals who are at a higher risk, have dependent-care responsibilities or can effectively work remotely can continue to do so.

More information about safety precautions, including educational trainings, wearing facial coverings, physical distancing, encouraging virtual meetings and increased cleanings of frequently touched surfaces, will be shared soon.

As we phase in our return to campus, we will remain vigilant through the summer and into the fall. Together, we will continue to adjust our practices based upon the latest available guidance from local and state officials, always with the goal of creating a safe environment for everyone at UCF.

Our teams continue to plan for how and when we will welcome back our students into classrooms, residence halls and campus activities and are working closely with the Florida Board of Governors. We hope to share decisions about the fall semester in June.

Leadership Updates
When I became president, I knew that managing the challenges from COVID-19 would be my No. 1 priority. I also believe that UCF’s long-term stability and success come from having strong leaders at every level of the university who empower everyone to perform to their highest potential.
We have been fortunate to have interim leaders who have helped the institution through the transitions of the past two years. It is time to begin building a permanent cabinet that will guide UCF’s future. The pandemic has proven it is more important than ever to focus on greater efficiencies and effectiveness in everything we do.

That is why we will be launching national searches for a chief financial officer and chief operations officer. Both will be critical to ensuring our operational excellence and helping us to strategically invest in the university’s academic enterprise moving forward.
More information about both searches will be shared soon. In the meantime, I am grateful to our interim CFO Joe Trubacz and interim COO Misty Shepherd for their continued leadership. I also appreciate the dedication and hard work of the people in each of their areas who have led UCF’s financial and administrative operations through a turbulent time.

Our people drive our greatness. The optimism and energy with which you face challenges demonstrate our strong commitment to our mission – even as the ways we work, teach and conduct our research change. I know UCF is full of talented and creative people who will continue to “Charge On” to new heights, building our future together.

All the best,

If you select Option 2, you will choose a move-out appointment time in the Housing Portal beginning the week of May 4. We will send an additional email when the move-out appointments are available in the Housing Portal. Move-out appointments will take place from May 21 through June 17.

 

Step 3: Move out
Option 1: Moving Company (May 6 – 20)
Suddath will work during your scheduled appointment time to pack, store, ship or discard items as per your agreement with them. Suddath is not able to donate belongings on your behalf.

At the scheduled time, UCF DHRL staff will give Suddath access to the contracted room(s).
DHRL staff will be on-site in offices during the time Suddath staff is packing belongings.
Suddath staff will hold a video conference with the student during packing to ensure identification of the correct belongings.
All Suddath employees will be clearly identified via uniform and are Level 2 background checked, which means they have passed a state and national fingerprint-based check that considers disqualifying offenses for employees in positions of trust. UCF will not assume any costs or liability for lost or damaged items.
The average cost per resident will range between $200 and $265, excluding long-term storage fees and shipping distances. Charges will vary based on selected services.
Option 2: Move Out Appointment (May 21 – June 17)
You will return to campus during your scheduled appointment date and time to move your belongings out.

Appointments are 2 hours in length.
To maintain appropriate social distancing, you may bring no more than 2 additional individuals to assist.
Appointments are limited by building or floor to adhere with social distancing guidelines.
Safety measures will include stanchions and tape on ground for proper distancing.
We strongly recommend you bring your own masks and gloves.
Key return and express check-out will be a touch-free process.
You will only have access to your room on the day of your move out appointment.
DHRL staff will be on-site in offices during move out appointment times.
Dumpsters and donation locations will be available in all communities.
Thank you for your cooperation as we work through these unprecedented times. We wish you continued health and success. For questions, please respond to this email at housing@ucf.edu.",609,fl,4
University of Central Florida,29-Apr-2020,"The past weeks have been difficult for all of us. COVID-19 has changed the ways that we work and live. Yesterday, President Cartwright wrote to us about some of the financial challenges the university is addressing. While UCF continues to plan next steps with everyone’s health and safety in mind, I want to address the personal hardships that many of you are facing now and offer some help.

I am thrilled to announce that our family of UCF employees answered the call for help and donated over 100,000 hours of personally accrued leave time to support our coworkers who have exhausted their own leave and are unable to work because of COVID-19.

Our faculty, who are working now to finish grading for the semester, have asked for a few more days to complete their donations. We are very happy to hear that there are more employees who want to help and have extended the donation window to May 11. We continue to gratefully accept donations at https://www.ucf.edu/lp/knights-care-leave-share/.

Many of us are working remotely and will continue to do so until further notice and pending conversations with our supervisors. Unfortunately, many UCF employees cannot work right now for a number of reasons including jobs that cannot be performed remotely, caring for children whose schools are closed, or the direct impact of a COVID-19 illness. For many of these employees, Emergency Paid Sick Leave will run out tomorrow, April 30.

For employees unable to work because of caring for a minor at home, I urge you to apply now for Emergency Family and Medical Leave: https://hr.ucf.edu/families-first-coronavirus-response-act/.

For leave-accruing employees who are unable to work because of COVID-19, your colleagues have generously provided for your support. Once you have exhausted your personally accrued leave, please request leave share at: https://www.ucf.edu/lp/knights-care-leave-share/

We are counting on supervisors and HR liaisons to help employees understand what leave they might be eligible to receive. HR has created a resource to help with this: https://hr.ucf.edu/files/COVID19-Leave-Options-at-a-Glance.pdf. Of course, your points of contacts in UCF Human Resources are always available to assist.

Finally, I want to remind you that UCF offers an excellent Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides a multitude of free resources, including information, training, counseling, and other forms of assistance and referrals to all non-student employees. I would encourage anyone wanting to better care for themselves or their family or who is uncertain about where to turn for emotional support to check out the EAP: https://HealthAdvocate.com/members.

As President Cartwright mentioned yesterday, we do not know for sure what the future holds for us as the university awaits future guidance from public health and government officials. We do know, however, that the UCF community will get through this together.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for giving so generously and for working so hard to help each other and to serve our students. You make me proud to be a Knight.

University of Central Florida,29-Apr-2020,"UCF is so proud of the way our students have adapted to learning and studying in new ways, but we recognize that COVID-19 has also led to financial hardships for many.

That’s why we are happy to share that thanks to federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or “CARES” Act, UCF will soon distribute more than $25 million in aid to our eligible students who need it most.

This is an important step in helping eligible students overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic and continue on their paths to academic and career success. The funds are designed to assist with expenses for undergraduate, graduate and MD students related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, such as housing, food, course materials, technology, health care and child care.

Students can apply for the aid here: https://tinyurl.com/UCF-CARES-ACT-Funding. The application window will be open through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, May 19.

Note that students must have submitted a 2019-2020 FAFSA or must submit a FAFSA application in order to be eligible for the funding. The federal legislation requires that students be degree-seeking, enrolled in the term for which they are seeking assistance, and U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens in order to be eligible for the emergency funding. Additionally, UCF Online students are not eligible.

All applications will be considered, but UCF’s focus is on helping eligible students with the most urgent needs. For example, students who have had difficulty paying off-campus rent or who had to purchase equipment to complete their courses online will be prioritized over students who received housing or dining refunds.

Due to the anticipated high volume of applications and the process reviewing applications, we expect that it will be 3-4 weeks before students will receive the money.

We hope that knowing that support could be coming offers some sense of relief.

University of Central Florida,28-Apr-2020,"While the spring semester is ending in ways none of us imagined, I am proud of the resiliency and resolve I have seen in my first weeks as president.

Despite the incredible challenges from COVID-19, you have acted boldly to best serve our students and help our community through building a community of scholarship entirely online, making masks for our heroes and helpers, partnering with Central Florida’s front-line responders to battle the virus and in many other innovative ways.

There is no doubt the past several weeks have been difficult. The pandemic has had devastating effects on universities and communities across the world. While we do not yet know its full impact in Florida or on UCF, the information and data we will learn during the next month will be critical to our decision-making.

Our leadership team is planning for a variety of scenarios for possible impacts to our operations and how and when we could reopen the campus, including what it means for our teaching, research, clinical, student support, athletics and other activities.

These decisions will be made consistent with federal and state guidance with our UCF family’s health and safety top of mind and in coordination with the colleges and administrative units, the UCF Board of Trustees and the Florida Board of Governors.

For now, we are operating under the assumption that face-to-face classes would resume this fall, with social distancing and other protective measures that prioritize the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and campus visitors.

This means we likely will need to think differently about how our learning, research and work environments look and function going forward. We also are planning for other scenarios that involve a later start for face-to-face classes. I expect we will decide on the fall semester in June, and we will share that update with you.

Better Ways of Working Together
The pandemic has also made clear a responsibility for us to find more efficiencies in areas across the university so that we can emerge from these challenges a stronger institution. While our leadership team is closely looking at improvements we can make to the ways we work, it is up to all of us to consider how we can operate more effectively in support of our students and academic mission, especially in the face of financial uncertainties created by COVID-19.

Thanks to the federal CARES Act, UCF has received $51 million to support university operations and students impacted by COVID-19. This is the largest allocation to any Florida university and the fourth-largest in the nation, as the legislation prioritized schools serving the most Pell-eligible students.

Half of those funds will go directly to support our students with the greatest need in the form of emergency aid. The other half will help to offset some of the financial losses we are projecting through the summer. Other actions, like hiring, travel and purchasing freezes we instituted earlier this month, should save us $13 million through this fiscal year.

Together, these efforts will help us offset the financial strains of COVID-19, but we will continue to look for other efficiencies and understand the potential that ongoing financial impacts could require difficult decisions. I do not believe we can simply cut our way to excellence. We must continue to strategically invest in the human capital, initiatives and programs that will make UCF exceptional.

Our success is because of our talented people and a culture of innovation and grit that believes anything is possible — as shown by each of this semester’s graduating students.

This week, I hope you will join me in celebrating these graduates’ achievements during Saturday’s virtual commencement ceremonies, while also reflecting on everything you and our students have accomplished in this extraordinary time.

All the best,

University of Central Florida,27-Apr-2020,"On April 29, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site will open in Lake Nona through a partnership between the UCF College of Medicine, Aventus Health and Tavistock.

The testing is by appointment only for people across the community. Patients must have a test order from a physician. Testing is covered by insurance. Those without insurance can get a free test through federal assistance.

Appointments will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday in the parking lot behind UCF Lake Nona Cancer Center, 6400 Sanger Road, Orlando FL 32827. Appointments may end before 5 p.m. if the 250 daily appointments are filled earlier.

Public health officials stay that more widespread testing is key in getting our community, state and nation back to “normal.” Screening those who show symptoms allows us to identify and treat those who are ill, identify those they came in contact with and tell them they must isolate to stop further spread.

COVID-19 symptoms include:

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
If you wish to be tested, follow these steps:

If you have an order for a test from your healthcare provider: Call Aventus Health directly to schedule a testing appointment at 407-986-0133
If you are a patient at UCF Health — the College of Medicine’s physician practice — or are a UCF employee: Contact UCF Health to obtain an order for a test by calling 407-266-3627
If you need to speak to a physician about getting a test: Get in touch with Aventus Health directly by calling 855-282-4860
After the patient has been screened by a provider, Aventus will reach out to complete all necessary paperwork, including insurance coverage and schedule an appointment for testing. Upon arrival during a scheduled time, individuals will drive through and receive the testing with a swab designated specifically for them. Following the 10-minute test, they’ll receive results in 24 to 48 hours.

The College of Medicine site is the second UCF drive-through testing location. COVID-19 testing continues on the main campus in Garage A.

University of Central Florida,27-Apr-2020,"As we continue to adapt to our “new normal,” UCF understands that many of our students and their families are experiencing hardships.

This is a stressful time for everyone, and we appreciate your patience as university leaders continue to make decisions in the best interests of our students, faculty and staff members, and our larger community.

Last month, UCF’s Board of Trustees approved refunds for on-campus housing for the Spring 2020 semester.

At the same time, UCF leaders sent a letter to off-campus housing managers urging them to be flexible with students in light of hardships caused by COVID-19. UCF continues to advocate on behalf of students, but the decision to offer refunds or terminate off-campus leases ultimately resides with the individual privately-owned properties.

Since sharing these updates, we’ve received many housing-related questions, and we’ve addressing those here.

What resources exist for students experiencing financial hardships?
UCF’s Knights Emergency Fund offers financial assistance to students who are experiencing a distressing situation that significantly impacts academic or personal success. Those in need are urged to contact them to see what assistance is available: https://scs.sdes.ucf.edu/.

In addition, thanks to federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or “CARES” Act, UCF will soon be able to distribute more than $25 million in aid to our students who need it most. These emergency grants can be used for eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care. Additional information, including how to apply for this funding, will be communicated to students this week.

What is “managed housing?”
Managed housing is an agreement where UCF acts as the property manager for privately-owned student housing. Generally, UCF is responsible for facilitating the leases with students, marketing the property to students, providing resident assistants and programs, as well as certain maintenance responsibilities, and in exchange, UCF is paid a fee for managing the property. The private owner is responsible for setting lease rates and the building and program budgets.

Northview, UnionWest and Rosen College Housing are UCF managed housing.

What is “affiliated housing?”
Affiliated housing is a step removed from managed housing. In this situation, private owners engage another private company to manage the student housing. The property manager engages UCF to provide very limited services – such as resident assistants or programming — to the property. UCF also agrees to refer students to affiliated housing in the event the university-owned and managed housing is full. In affiliated housing, UCF does not facilitate any of the leasing arrangements; rather these are the responsibility of the property manager.

Knights Circle and the Pointe at Central are affiliated with UCF.

Are there any other managed or affiliated housing communities?
No. All other housing properties and complexes surrounding UCF are privately-owned apartments that are neither affiliated nor managed by UCF.

Does UCF have the legal ability to require the owners of managed or affiliated housing to refund to students?
No. Because UCF does not own the properties, we can only encourage – not require – the owners to offer financial flexibility to students, and we are actively doing so.

Why do UCF shuttles run to complexes the university doesn’t own?
UCF shuttles run daily to several apartment complexes around the main campus to assist students who may not have adequate transportation to get to classes. Having a shuttle stop at an apartment complex does not mean that complex is managed or affiliated with the university. Rather, shuttles are managed by UCF and funded by the per-credit-hour Transportation Access Fee, and the service is offered by the university as a convenience for students.

When can I move my student out?
At this time, students are discouraged from returning to campus, in line with the state’s “Safer At Home” order, which calls for avoiding non-essential travel and relying on social distancing to stop further spread of COVID-19.

Housing and Residence Life is providing residents with two options for retrieving belongings from their room in the future:

Option 1: We have partnered with a university-approved vendor for residents and their families to directly arrange packing, storing and shipping options. This will take place during the month of May and may be an ideal option for out-of-state students.
Option 2: Residents will sign up for a first come, first served move-out appointment to return to campus and conduct an express check out in alignment with social distancing guidelines. This will take place May through July.
More information about these options will be communicated to residents in the coming days. For now, Housing asks that residents select their preferred option in the Housing Portal.

Will students receive refunds for summer housing?
Summer 2020 rent for students who live on campus has not been billed and will not be billed unless an exemption is granted for students with extenuating circumstances to remain on campus. Because summer rent has not yet been billed, there will not be a refund process.

At this time no decision has been made about refunds for students who live in UnionWest and NorthView.

Please continue to stay safe and prioritize your health and well-being. Continue to check UCF’s coronavirus website for updates, and know students may also receive additional information via email.",874,fl,4
University of Central Florida,24-Apr-2020,"While the Spring 2020 semester is coming to an end in ways none of us could have anticipated, the sense of excitement and accomplishment that comes with the completion of the school year is present.

UCF is proud of our students’ resiliency and resolve in these challenging and uncertain times. Our students truly embody what it means to “Charge On!”

Thanks to federal relief from the “CARES Act,” UCF will be distributing $25.5 million in emergency aid to students with the most urgent need. We will share more information about how to apply for this funding soon, as part of our strong commitment to student success and helping one another through this difficult time.

While the trajectory of COVID-19 remains unknown, for now, let’s take a moment to reflect on the great work accomplished this spring and focus on a successful end to the semester.

Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading
The S/U opt-in period remains open through 11:59 p.m. Monday, April 27.

Given the disruptions of COVID-19, this allows students (except for M.D. students) to select whether they would like a S/U grade or letter grade for each of their Spring 2020 classes. Choices can be made or changed at any time up to next week’s deadline.

Instructions for choosing the S/U option are available here.

Students are reminded to consult with their advisors about their options and whether selecting S/U grading is a wise choice for them. To better understand S/U grading and potential implications, students are also encouraged to review these FAQs for undergraduate and graduate students.

Textbook Information
While UCF Bookstores are not physically open, operations are moving forward with staff available to assist students virtually.
Students with access to their textbooks: Rentals can be shipped back to the bookstore they were rented from free of charge using the appropriate return label.

UCF Main Campus
UCF Downtown
UCF Rosen College
If textbooks were purchased, students can sell them back for cash. The bookstore has partnered with MBS Textbook Exchange for online buyback options.

Students who do not have access to their textbooks: To accommodate students during these challenging times, the rental return deadline has been extended to June 15.

Students enrolled in summer classes: When available, choose a digital format for instant access to textbooks and course materials. Free shipping will be available for new, used and rental textbooks through the bookstore website, but note that shipping times may be longer than usual due to local delivery conditions. Students can find their upcoming semester course materials through my.ucf.edu → Student Self Service → My Class Schedule.

Virtual Commencement
UCF’s Spring 2020 class includes more than 8,600 students who will celebrate with us during virtual commencement ceremonies on May 2.

Former UCF football stars Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin — who currently play for the Seattle Seahawks — will serve as commencement speakers during the virtual ceremonies, which will be hosted on UCF’s Facebook and YouTube pages so that graduates and their families, friends and faculty members can watch.

More information and the time of each college’s ceremony are available here.

What’s Next
Remote instruction will continue for all summer sessions, meaning that the earliest face-to-face classes could resume is in the fall. UCF will announce a decision about fall classes in June.

To help our students registered for summer classes, UCF is waiving the Transportation Access Fee, which will result in savings of $2.5 million for our students. When applicable, the Materials and Supply Fee also will be waived for summer courses. UCF is not considering waiving additional summer fees or providing refunds for Spring 2020 fees at this time.

University of Central Florida,20-Apr-2020,"As the end of a historic semester approaches, I want to tell you how very proud I am of how our faculty have responded to the greatest teaching challenge of our professional lives.

The abrupt shift to remote teaching required a heavy lift in a very short time. In a single week, our faculty, with help from the Division of Digital Learning, moved almost 6,000 face-to-face and blended sections to remote delivery. This transition occurred in the midst of personal struggles with family care, health concerns, working remotely and, for some, personal loss. Add to that the emotional labor of supporting struggling students, and it is a heavy load.

I am grateful for all that you’ve done and how you continue to support our students and one another.

This sudden change has not, of course, been seamless for faculty or for students. Collectively, our students are facing job loss, fear of illness and the future, and the switch to remote classes. For more students than we would like, this is a hard time. The same is true for our colleagues who work for UCF.

As the semester nears an end, I again ask that you treat your students and one another with compassion. Students with technology problems, illness, or anxiety may need your consideration to complete assignments or exams.

Please also take the online “Kognito At-Risk” training to learn more about how to help students at risk. Instructions are at https://hr.ucf.edu/files/Kognito-Course-Completion-Guide.pdf.

Our faculty and staff have worked hard to keep our university running as smoothly as possible through remote teaching and working. Even before my arrival, I have been so impressed by your innovative spirit and commitment to our students — and each other — during these challenges.

Through the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, UCF employees are eligible to receive up to two weeks of paid sick leave. But some members of our UCF family already need extended leaves of absence to take care of themselves or their families, while others are unable to work remotely.

That’s why we are launching the Knights Care Leave Share. Through this program, you are able to donate your annual and sick leave into a UCF-sponsored leave bank for your fellow employees who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and have exhausted all of their personal leave. Eligible recipients will be paid their normal rate.

Leave donations will be accepted through April 24. The program is entirely voluntary. If you would like to and are able to donate your time to your colleagues, you can do so by submitting a donation form. If you need a donation, please ask for help by completing an application.

For Students
Student support functions, such as academic advising, financial aid, counseling and other essential resources, will continue to be offered remotely to help you be successful. UCF Keep Learning is another helpful resource to help students navigate online learning.

Incoming students will attend orientation virtually, and we are working on additional support services to help them thrive at UCF during the period of remote instruction and beyond.

No decision about summer commencement ceremonies has been made at this time.

Housing
In light of continued remote instruction, on-campus summer housing will not be available except for those students with extenuating circumstances who will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

More information will be shared directly with residents soon, and we ask for your patience as we navigate this challenging process.

It remains imperative that residents who didn’t return to campus after Spring Break not return to move out and retrieve their belongings. This is in line with the state’s “Safer At Home” order. We understand the strong desire to do so and will communicate information about moving out at a time when it is safe and prudent to do so.

S/U Grading Opt-In Period
Starting Friday, most students will be able to select whether they would like a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade or a letter grade for each of their Spring 2020 classes. The opt-in period will be open until 11:59 p.m. April 27.

There are important factors to consider when making this decision, but given the possible academic disruptions and hardships students have faced in the wake of COVID-19, this gives them the ability to select the option that works best for them. Students are highly encouraged to consult with their advisors about their options.

To also help students think critically about the impacts of their decision, we’ve put together FAQs for undergraduate and graduate students. Instructions about how to opt-in to S/U grading are available here.

Updates for Employees
As a reminder, remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

UCF HR has been working to adapt to federal, state and university guidance related to COVID-19 and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the federal legislation that took effect on April 1.

UCF will continue to provide paid administrative leave through April 16 to eligible faculty and A&P and USPS employees who are unable to work remotely or on campus.

Use of emergency paid sick leave also has been expanded for all eligible employees who are unable to work due to the governor’s Safer At Home Order that took effect April 3. The expansion allows employees — including OPS — to use emergency paid sick leave if they are unable to work remotely or on campus because of the order. This includes employees whose units do not currently have work they can do.

Employees currently on administrative leave will be eligible to use emergency paid sick leave to cover hours they are unable to work from April 17-30 due to the Safer At Home Order.

Employees have already been granted the total hours of emergency paid sick leave they are eligible to receive and can view their leave balances on their April 10 paychecks via myUCF.

Review the updated HR FAQs. Employees are encouraged to reach out to their HR liaisons with any questions.

Testing Site on Campus
On Monday, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site opened in UCF’s Garage A, providing up to 250 tests a day on weekdays to members of the community with a prescription and appointment.

Students and faculty and staff members who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 are encouraged to reach out to a healthcare provider and inquire about testing. Students should contact Student Health Services at 407-823-2701. Faculty or staff members should call UCF Health at 407-266-3627.

Upon calling, individuals will be given an appointment to be screened for symptoms. Those who qualify for testing will be provided a prescription, which will then be sent to Aventus — the third-party company facilitating the testing — to schedule a time for testing.

Tests are administered efficiently via a drive-through process that takes no more than 10 minutes from the start of the appointment time, and results can be expected within 24-48 hours.

Additional Information
In this period of dynamic change and unprecedented challenge, our students and faculty and staff members keep charging on.

How Will This S/U Option Work?
Faculty members will continue to assign grades as outlined in the syllabi. At the end of the semester, the grades they submit will be converted by the Registrar’s Office to either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, for students selecting this option. For undergraduate students who opt for S/U grading, grades A through C will be marked Satisfactory (S); for graduate students, A through B- will be Satisfactory (S). The grade designation will appear on transcripts with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this spring semester because of the pandemic. Neither S or U grades will affect the GPA. Finally, students who do not choose to opt into the S/U grading need to take no further action.

By now, I hope students are utilizing the online resources available at Keep Learning. For faculty, we have created Keep Teaching and a Faculty Toolkit with other resources.

This is an unprecedented time for all of us at UCF. Please continue to care for one another. And please stay safe.

University of Central Florida,8-Apr-2020,"UCF appreciates everyone’s patience and understanding on dining membership refunds during the continually evolving COVID-19 pandemic. UCF will issue dining membership refunds to eligible students who are no longer on campus and have discontinued use of their dining membership.

Eligible students will receive a prorated refund based on the unused portion of their dining membership for the spring 2020 semester beginning March 16, 2020. The refund will also include unused spring dining dollars.

For students who have been approved to stay on campus, dining memberships will remain active.
For students who did not return to campus on or after Monday, March 16, a partial dining membership refund will be issued. The refund will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals after March 16, plus the total amount of unused spring dining dollars.
For students who returned to campus on or after Monday, March 16, but subsequently left campus early due to COVID-19, a partial refund will be issued. The refund will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from the last date of use after March 16, plus the total amount of unused spring dining dollars.
Refunds will be posted in eligible students’ accounts and will be shown in their myUCF account. Most students have their student account linked to a bank through direct deposit. Students who do not have direct deposit are encouraged to sign up by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, and clicking Direct Deposit.

Students who have not set up direct deposit before refunds are posted will have checks sent to their mailing address on file with UCF. Students are encouraged to verify the address on file is correct, and to update it if it is not. Verify or update your mailing address by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, clicking Student Center, and reviewing the Personal Information section.

Any university balance will be paid prior to the refund being disbursed.

Please understand that this may take some time, given the current state of campus operations and demands on personnel time to address emergency issues associated with the pandemic. UCF will make every effort to issue the available refunds beginning Thursday April 9, following the posting of the credit.",371,fl,4

University of Central Florida,3-Apr-2020,"Due to the extraordinary COVID-19 circumstances, UCF graduate students will have the opportunity to choose satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for eligible Spring 2020 courses. Students will be able to choose this option from April 10 through April 27. After April 27, students may no longer choose a grading system and their choices are final. Transcripts will indicate that the S/U option was made available this semester because of the pandemic.

It is very important that you contact your advisor and/or program director to see whether this choice makes sense for you. Choosing S/U may in some cases impact financial aid and this choice may not meet requirements for your degree.

GRADING SYSTEM AND GPAs
The university uses an alphabetic system to identify student grades and other actions regarding student progress or class attendance, as follows. Refer to the catalog for detailed information.

Grades	Grading Points Per Semester Hour of Credit
A	4.00
A-	3.75
B+	3.25
B	3.00
B-	2.75
C+	2.25
C	2.00
C-	1.75
D+	1.25
D	1.00
D-	.75
F	0.00
NC	No Credit (replaces the use of D+, D and D- in certain cases)
S	Satisfactory (with credit) satisfactory progress
U	Unsatisfactory (no credit) unsatisfactory progress
If you choose to change your letter graded courses to an S/U grade, those selected courses with grades that are equivalent to a A, A-, B+, B or B- grades will be converted to a Satisfactory (S) grade.

If your instructor agrees to give you an Incomplete (I) grade, and you wish to opt in for S/U grading, you must opt in by April 27 for that course. Then, once you complete the course requirements (or fail to complete the course requirements in the time allowed), your earned letter grade will be converted to S/U on your transcript.

Grades of C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F or NC will be converted to an Unsatisfactory (U) grade. Keep in mind that most labs are linked directly to the course. If you are registered for a lab that is graded separately and does not require you to be registered simultaneously to the lecture, then the option will exist.

Grades of S and U do not impact the GPA. A grade of S will result in credit for the course, but it will not be used in the calculation of your GPA. A grade of U will reflect attempted credit that was not earned in the course, but it will not affect the GPA.

Students may select the S/U grading option for most courses that are graded. Keep in mind that most labs are linked directly to the course. If you are registered for a lab that is graded separately and does not require you to be registered simultaneously to the lecture, then the option will exist.

OPTING IN AND WITHDRAWAL
I am considering opting-in for an S/U grade for a class. How should I proceed?
Read through these FAQs, review your graduate program handbook, and schedule an appointment to speak with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director for guidance. Some programs have requirements that limit you to letter grades (e.g., accreditation standards; minimum letter grade requirements) for certain classes. Additionally, some programs have strict rules about dismissal for “U” grades that you should consider as you make this choice.

I am in provisional admission status, on probation or on a conditional retention plan. Can I choose S/U grading?
Yes, but it is important to consider the implications of your choice. If you were admitted provisionally or are currently on probation or a Conditional Retention Plan, you should contact the student services team in Graduate Studies (email gradrcrd@ucf.edu) about your specific situation before opting in.

How does a student opt-in? By what deadline?
Students will opt-in by completing an online request form. When available, students will opt-in using the self-service option in myUCF. Navigate to my.UCF.edu > Student Self Service > Student Center > Other Academic (dropdown menu) > COVID-19 S/U Option. The decision to opt-in should be made in consultation with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director as soon as possible. The S/U opt-in period will begin April 10; the last day to opt-in is April 27.

Can I withdraw from a class instead of opting-in for an S/U?
You can withdraw from a class until Monday, April 20.

What happens if I don’t opt-in for an S/U?
You will receive the letter grade you earn for your class(es).

How does my decision to opt-in for a S/U grading impact my financial aid and/or satisfactory academic progress (SAP)?
Information about the impact of S/U grading on financial aid will be given prior to April 10. Please pay attention to your knights.ucf.edu email for the information.

Will opting-in for S/U grades affect my tuition reimbursement from my employer? What about my scholarship?
It is important that you check with your employer or scholarship award PRIOR to opting in for S/U grading. Some employers and scholarships will only pay if you earn letter grades in your courses.

Is the request form available yet?
The online form is not yet available. It will be available April 10. Students will be notified when this online form is available.

COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND CONTINUED STUDIES
Are there any classes that are not eligible for S/U grading?
Most classes are eligible for the Spring 2020 S/U opt-in policy. There are only a few exemptions that have been approved. Without a special exemption from the university, your faculty advisor or graduate program director cannot prevent you from opting in for S/U grading. Instead, their role is to advise you on what they think are the potential consequences of your choice. You are encouraged to seek their advice, but the ultimate decision is yours.

If I am taking a class that is a pre-requisite, how will an S/U impact my ability to register for the next class?
Some courses require a set letter grade in the pre-requisite for it to count. An S/U grade could negatively impact your academic progress in that degree program. It is important for you to consult with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director to understand the impact of the S/U election on required pre-requisites.

I am a graduate student who is enrolled in an undergraduate class as a pre-requisite for my graduate program and I am expecting a C grade in this class. If I choose the S/U option, will I receive an S or a U?
S/U grading is linked to your status as a graduate student. Thus, any grade of C that you earn, regardless of the level of class you are taking, will be evaluated using the graduate S/U conversion. Any C grade you earn will be converted to a U grade.

How does a U grade impact my GPA or academic standing?
An unsatisfactory (U) grade will not impact your GPA, but it may impact your academic standing. In general, receiving more than 6 credits of U grades can result in dismissal. Some programs have more strict standards, so you should refer to your graduate program handbook for information about how a U grade may impact your academic standing.

How would choosing S/U grading impact me if I’m part of a special population or cohort such as international students, veterans, student athletes, etc?
Please contact the appropriate resource office to anticipate the impact:

Student Athletes	Academic Services for Student Athletes (ASSA)	407-823-5895 or assa@ucf.edu
International Students	UCF Global	407-823-2337
Veterans	Veterans Academic Resource Center (VARC)	407-823-2707 or varc@ucf.edu
Financial Aid	Office of Student Financial Assistance	407-823-2827 or finaid@ucf.edu
I expect to earn a C (or C-/C+) in a class. What should I do?
This may be a difficult decision to make depending on your circumstances, so we recommend that you discuss this with your faculty advisor, graduate program director, college graduate advising office and/or the College of Graduate Studies. Failure to discuss your options with a knowledgeable advisor could result in making a choice that will negatively impact your academic progress in your program.

If I already withdrew, will I be able to reinstate in a course now that the opportunity to earn a U exists?
Students who request a withdrawal reversal already have the ability to do so within 3 business days from the date you withdrew. However, the request to reverse the withdrawal in this case must occur no later than Wednesday, April 22.

If I am graduating this semester, how will S/U affect me in a class I need to pass to graduate? How will it affect my GPA?
Remember that S/U grades do not change your GPA. They only reflect credit earned or not earned. For instance, if you are in your last semester and need specific letter grades to get or keep your GPA above 3.0, then the S/U grade will not be a good choice for you. If your GPA is already above 3.0 and you just need the credits to complete your degree, then the S/U grade might be something to consider. It is important to understand and review your degree audit and situation with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director so that you can make an informed choice.

How will S/U grades this semester be explained when I have my transcript sent to another professional or graduate school?
The back of the transcripts contains a legend detailing grades. Transcripts will indicate that the S/U option was made available this semester because of the pandemic. Additional information will be available at registrar.ucf.edu. If you are a graduate certificate or master’s degree student wishing to apply to another graduate degree program, you should talk with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director for information about how choosing S/U grades may impact your chances of being admitted in other graduate programs or how choosing S/U grades might impact the course transfers to those programs.

How will U grades impact my graduate assistantship?
Graduate assistantship students are expected to maintain good academic standing. Speak with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director if you have questions about how receiving a U grade could impact your funding.

How will U grades impact my university fellowship?
Most university fellowships require students to receive satisfactory grades in all classes (unsatisfactory grades are C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, NC and U). If you have questions about how a U grade could impact your graduate fellowship, email gradfellowship@ucf.edu.

Would I have to use grade forgiveness later if I choose to repeat a course in which I received a U grade?
No. Grade forgiveness is not available to graduate students.

Would repeating a course in which I received a U be considered as a second attempt?
Yes. U grades means that you did not earn credit for the course. If it is a required or core course in your plan of study, it would have to be repeated. If it is an elective course, then you could choose to repeat the elective course or you could pick a different elective from those allowed as part of the degree. You would still need to meet the necessary elective credit hour requirement for your degree plan of study.

Can I appeal my decision to receive an S/U for a class?
Appeals to reverse your request for an S/U will not be allowed.

Please consult with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director before making any decisions regarding your academic plan.",1915,fl,4
University of Central Florida,3-Apr-2020,"This has undoubtedly been a trying time for the UCF community.

COVID-19 is impacting us all in some way, and public health officials are advising that the worst may be yet to come.

Still, I’ve been inspired by the bravery and humanity I’ve seen from so many. From my health care peers working on the frontlines to the restaurant workers and store employees sustaining us to our own faculty and staff helping our students navigate stress and focus on their academic success — there is much to be hopeful about.

Another positive: Next week, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site will open at UCF in partnership with Aventus Biolabs.

Public health officials say that more widespread testing is key in getting the nation back to “normal,” and this is an opportunity for UCF to contribute to that cause.

 

About the Testing Site
Starting Monday, COVID-19 tests will be available to all members of the community with an appointment on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or until appointments are filled. The drive-through tests will be administered in Garage A.

Patients must be screened for symptoms by a healthcare provider before a test can be prescribed to those who qualify.

UCF students can obtain an ordered test from Student Health Services telehealth by calling 407-823-2701. UCF faculty and staff members can obtain their ordered test from their primary care provider or by contacting UCF Health at 407-266-3627. Aventus also can connect anyone with a telehealth provider by calling 855-282-4860.

After the patient has been screened by a provider, Aventus will reach out to complete all necessary paperwork and schedule an appointment for testing. Upon arrival during a scheduled time, individuals will drive through and receive the testing with a swab designated specifically for them. Following the 10-minute test, they’ll receive results in 24 to 48 hours.

UCF Gives Back
The UCF community is making many other contributions to the battle against COVID-19.

Earlier this week, UCF employees came through in a big way, gathering masks, gloves, goggles and other medical equipment from labs and departments and donating them to hospitals. These supplies will help sustain our local hospitals as they manage the expected surge of ill patients in the weeks to come.

The team at Limbitless Solutions also is helping medical workers by creating 3D printed visors, a piece of the disposable face shields these workers desperately need.

Workers like UCF alumna Jessica Goldonowicz DeSalvo, an emergency medicine physician who shared her powerful story about waiting for the “tsunami” of COVID-19 to hit as a way to encourage people to stay home and help reduce further spread of the virus.

There are countless other projects underway by UCF students and faculty and staff members to assist with this pandemic and its impact in a variety of ways. I know our entire community appreciates these efforts.

Each of us can do our part by taking COVID-19 seriously and doing everything in our power to reduce further spread. Continue practicing social distancing and taking personal health precautions, including practicing proper hand-washing and avoiding touching your face and frequently touched surfaces.

University of Central Florida,3-Apr-2020,"The Department of Housing and Residence Life will begin issuing housing refunds for a portion of the spring semester’s rent to residents that were not able to return to campus or have left their rooms, at the direction of the university in response to COVID-19.

Housing rent refunds will be prorated from March 27, 2020 through April 28, 2020. This represents approximately 25% of the spring semester.

If housing costs were paid with a credit card, the refund will go back on the credit card. Any unpaid charges owed to the university will be deducted from your housing refund. Refunds will be posted to eligible students’ accounts and will show in myUCF. If you have a direct deposit account set up, your refund will be deposited there. If not, it is strongly recommended that you enroll in direct deposit. Find instructions on how to set up a direct deposit.

University of Central Florida,31-Mar-2020,"The impact of COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way all of us operate. For some of you, navigating the responsibilities of work while also caring for your families or your own health has made the transition particularly difficult.

On Wednesday, April 1, new federal legislation takes effect that could bring some relief.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) may provide you and other UCF employees with additional benefits. The Act focuses on two areas: emergency paid sick leave and emergency family and medical leave. The Act is effective from April 1 through December 31, 2020 and provides limited leave benefits to eligible employees.

 

Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL)
Beginning April 1, UCF will provide eligible employees with Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL). The EPSL may be used if an employee is unable to work (or work remotely) for one of several COVID-19 related reasons. Eligible full-time employees may be paid for up to 80 hours of EPSL. Eligible part-time employees will receive EPSL based on the average number of hours they work within a two-week period.

Eligible UCF employees will be automatically granted EPSL and can utilize this benefit by indicating the qualifying reason on their timesheet or LAPER in coordination with their department leave practices.

 

Emergency Family and Medical Leave (EFMLA)
In addition, eligible UCF employees can apply for Emergency Family and Medical Leave (EFMLA) if an employee is unable to work (or work remotely) because they are caring for their minor child, if the child’s school or child care provider is closed or unavailable due to the COVID-19 emergency.

The first ten days of emergency FMLA leave will be unpaid, but EPSL or regular accrued leave can be used during this period. After that, eligible employees will receive up to 2/3 of their regular pay for up to 10 weeks, for the number of hours that the employee would normally be scheduled to work. EFMLA claims will count towards the regular, annual FMLA limit of twelve work weeks.

 

Additional Information
Our current circumstances have forced us all to make big adjustments to our routines, including how we teach and work. We are in this together, and we hope these emergency provisions bring some help to those who need it. As a reminder, faculty, A&P, and USPS staff whose circumstances do not qualify for the FFCRA emergency leave provisions, and who are unable to work remotely during the Orange County Stay at Home Order, will be paid administrative leave from March 27 through April 9.

University of Central Florida,31-Mar-2020,"Dear Off-Campus Student Housing Managers, 

As you know, our world has changed drastically in recent weeks due to COVID-19. Businesses have been shuttered and communities ordered to “stay at home” to slow the spread of this virus. We’ve seen big changes at the University of Central Florida, too. As directed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State University System, we’ve shifted all classes online for the spring and at least a portion of the summer semesters. In addition, we’ve intentionally depopulated campus by requesting our students return to their permanent residences. 

UCF has now begun processing refunds for on-campus student housing for a portion of the spring semester, and we also are working to provide relief for students who purchased meal plans. 

Your business is undoubtedly feeling the effects of this pandemic, even as you continue to support UCF and our students. We’re thankful to have you as a valued partner. At the same time, we know that many of our students are struggling as they navigate stress caused by the uncertainty of the pandemic; new virtual coursework; isolation from friends and social activities; and financial hardships from the loss of jobs and internships. We’ve heard from some students whose parents are guarantors on their lease and also now find themselves unexpectedly out of work. 

That’s why we are respectfully asking apartment and housing managers in the UCF area to work with our off-campus students on a case-by-case basis. Please consider granting early lease terminations and flexibility with rent payment plans, security deposits and guarantees. 

For those students who remain on your properties, we ask that you promote social distancing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In accordance with Orange County’s mandatory “Stay at Home” Executive Order, residents are ordered to stay at home as much as possible, with exceptions for trips deemed “essential.” Please discourage gatherings in your community spaces and help prevent parties from being hosted on your property.

Thank you for your consideration of our request and your continued support of UCF and our students. We know that by working together, we will all get through this. 

Sincerely, 

Thad Seymour Jr.

University of Central Florida,27-Mar-2020,"The people of UCF have consistently amazed me with what I’ve come to realize is the defining characteristic of Knight Nation: grit.

Grit, perseverance, determination, resilience. Whatever you call it, we are a community that always finds a way to overcome every obstacle and move forward. And we’ve faced an unprecedented challenge these past few weeks with COVID-19.

I know these are extremely difficult times for everyone. Because we’re not just professionals. We’re parents. We’re caregivers. We’re neighbors.

I just want to say how proud I am of our faculty and staff members, who, at the same time they’re taking care of our students, also are taking care of their families and loved ones.

Remote Working Update
As Wednesday’s UCF Alert said, the period of remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

For everyone’s health and safety, buildings will be locked to all employees, with the exception of those who have been approved by their dean or vice president as being critical to the university’s continued operation. These employees include: first responders, healthcare professionals, supply chain personnel, critical infrastructure support personnel, approved researchers and instructors, and certain contractors.

Employees who have this designation know it and have already had appropriate discussions with their supervisors. Employees who don’t fall into these categories should continue working remotely.

Also starting today through April 9, UCF will provide paid administrative leave to employees who are unable to work on campus and unable to work remotely. This leave applies to faculty, administrative and USPS employees.

We hope this will help with the financial strain the pandemic has caused so many in our campus community whose jobs don’t translate to remote work.

Families First Coronavirus Response Act
Starting April 1, when the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act takes effect, faculty and staff — along with eligible OPS employees — may qualify for emergency leave.

All other faculty, administrative and USPS employees who do not qualify for the federal aid and who cannot work remotely will be provided administrative leave through April 9.

Employees not available for work due to illness or personal time must take sick or annual leave per UCF policy.
UCF HR will share more detailed guidance about the federal legislation and will continue to provide updates directly to departments via each office’s HR liaison.

Ingenuity and Compassion
At Tuesday’s Board of Trustees meeting, I shared the ingenuity of our faculty members and our Division of Digital Learning team. In one week, they helped transition nearly 5,000 face-to-face course sections to remote delivery, and helped our faculty members convert another 700 mixed-mode sections fully online.

In the past week, I’ve also heard many stories of our community’s compassion and creativity. Among the many examples, professors and staff are sewing masks for our healthcare providers and developing free educational podcasts for teachers and families caring for people with disabilities in a new world of virtual learning.

Our lives have been disrupted, and we’ve taken a path none of us could have predicted. But seeing the grit and care shown by our faculty and staff, I’m confident we will get through this, together.

Thank you for all you do and … let’s keep Charging On!",532,fl,3
University of Central Florida,27-Mar-2020,"In response to students’ requests, UCF will offer undergraduates the option to select a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grade or a letter grade for eligible Spring 2020 courses. Students will be able to choose this option from April 10 – 27. Transcripts will indicate that the S/U option was made available this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is critical to understand how S/U grading may affect you. It is imperative to contact your advisor before making a grading decision. In some instances, an S/U grade may impact financial aid, degree program requirements and applications to graduate or professional school.

GRADING SYSTEM AND GPAs
 

What is UCF’s grading system?
UCF uses an alphabetic, plus/minus system to identify student grades and other actions regarding student progress or class attendance as outlined below. Refer to the Undergraduate Catalog for detailed information.

Grades	Grading Points Per Semester Hour of Credit
A	4.00
A-	3.75
B+	3.25
B	3.00
B-	2.75
C+	2.25
C	2.00
C-	1.75
D+	1.25
D	1.00
D-	.75
F	0.00
NC	No Credit (replaces the use of D+, D and D- in certain cases)
S	Satisfactory (with credit) satisfactory progress
U	Unsatisfactory (no credit) unsatisfactory progress
If you choose to select courses for S/U grading, those selected courses with grades that are equivalent to A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+ or C grades will convert to a satisfactory (S) grade. Grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F or NC will convert to an unsatisfactory (U) grade.

How does S/U grading impact GPAs?
Grades of S and U do not impact the GPA. A grade of S will result in credit for the course, but it will not be used in the calculation of the GPA. A grade of U will reflect attempted credit that was not earned in the course, but it will not affect the GPA.

How does an unsatisfactory grade impact my GPA or academic standing? 
A U grade will not impact your GPA, nor does it affect academic standing.

If I am graduating this semester, how will S/U affect me in a class I need to pass to graduate? How will it affect my GPA? 
It is essential to understand and review your degree audit and situation with your department or college advisor.

OPTING IN AND WITHDRAWAL
I am considering opting-in for an S/U grade for a class. How should I proceed? 
Read these FAQs and schedule an appointment to speak with your department or college advisor for guidance.

How do I opt-in to S/U grading? What’s the deadline?
You will complete an online request form using the self-service option in myUCF. Here are the steps you need to take:

Consult with your advisor as soon as possible.
Between April 10 to 27, submit your request for S/U grading. Go to the myUCF portal and select Student Self Service > Student Center > Other Academic (dropdown menu) > COVID-19 S/U Option.
Opt-in no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 27.
When will the request form be available?
The form will be available by April 10. UCF will notify you when it’s available.

What happens if I don’t opt-in for an S/U? 
You will receive the letter grade you earn for your class(es).

Can I withdraw from a class instead of opting-in for an S/U? 
Yes, you can withdraw from a class until Monday, April 20.

If I withdraw from a class, will I have an opportunity to reinstate in a course now that the opportunity to earn a U exists? 
Typically, you must request a withdrawal reversal within three business days from the date you withdrew. For Spring 2020, the request to reverse the withdrawal must occur no later than Wednesday, April 22.

COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND CONTINUED STUDIES
Are there any classes that are not eligible for S/U grading? 
Some classes may not be eligible for S/U grading. Information regarding UCF’s Spring 2020 S/U opt-in policy is forthcoming. You should seek guidance regarding this matter from faculty members and advisors.

 Can I choose an S/U grade for labs?
Most labs are associated with a course. You can select S/U grading if a lab is graded separately and does not require simultaneous registration in a lecture.

If I am taking a prerequisite class, will an S/U grade impact my ability to register for the next course? 
If your degree program requires a grade of a C or higher to advance to the next class, selecting the S/U option for the prerequisite may be inadvisable.

Does S/U grading impact students in special populations or cohorts?
You must contact the program office to determine how S/U grading will affect you.

How will my BHC University Honors status be determined based on Spring 2020 grades?

Good standing will be determined by using the UCF cumulative GPA and UCF Honors cumulative GPA as calculated by UCF after Spring 2020 grades are posted.
Students currently in good standing who achieve less than a 3.2 UCF cumulative GPA and/or a 3.0 cumulative Honors GPA after Spring 2020 grades are posted will receive a warning letter instead of being placed on probation.
Students currently on honors probation who achieve less than a 3.2 UCF term GPA and/or a 3.0 cumulative term GPA after Spring 2020 grades are posted will be placed on extended probation, instead of being removed from university honors.
Students graduating in Spring 2020 are expected to meet honors graduation requirements to graduate with university honors:
3.2 UCF cumulative GPA
3.0 honors cumulative GPA
Satisfactory completion of a minimum of eight BHC Honors courses as outlined on the BHC website 
BHC courses with grades of S will count toward the eight-course requirement.
Will selecting the S/U grading option impact my application to graduate or professional school? 
Please contact the graduate or professional program to which you are applying or the appropriate UCF resource office to discuss the possible impact of an S or U grade on your graduate or professional school application.

Degree program advisor
Pre-Health and Pre-Law Advising at 407-823-0101
College of Graduate Studies at 407-823-2766 (for referrals and advice from comparable programs at UCF)
Will selecting S/U grading impact my financial aid and/or satisfactory academic progress (SAP)? 
S, U and NC grades could help you maintain your current GPA because it won’t change it. S grades may also help you meet the earned hours requirements. However, a U or NC grade would not help you meet the earned hours requirement nor the SAP completion percentage standard.

How will Spring 2020 S/U grades appear on my transcript sent to professional and graduate schools? 
The back of transcripts contains a legend detailing grades. Spring 2020 transcripts will indicate that the S/U grade option was offered this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

How will S/U grades be reviewed by Bright Futures or other scholarships that require a GPA and credit requirement? 
U grades will not negatively impact your GPA, and you will not receive credit. S grades also do not affect your GPA, and you will receive credit for completing the course.

I received a U grade in a class, would I have to use grade forgiveness to repeat it later?
No.

Would repeating a course in which I received a U be considered a second attempt? 
Yes.

Will an S grade meet Gordon Rule Writing, Math, Civic Literacy and State Core requirements? 
Yes.

Can I complete my Gordon Rule classes with a C-?
Yes. But these courses (courses where a C- is earned) are not eligible for the S/U option.

What tools do I use to help me make registration decisions for the Summer 2020, Fall 2020 and Spring 2021?
Continue to use the Pegasus Path, myKnight Audit and mySchedule Builder to make registration decisions.

Can I appeal my decision to receive an S/U for a class? 
Appeals to reverse your request for an S/U will not be allowed. Before you select S/U grading, consult with a faculty member or your academic advisor.",1361,fl,3
University of Central Florida,27-Mar-2020,"This is an unprecedented time for our society and for all of us at UCF, both personally and professionally. We have asked a lot from you, and I am grateful for the way you have worked thoughtfully, creatively, and hard to help our students succeed. Thank you.

I am writing to give an update, but more importantly to acknowledge the critical need to care for our students and one another during these extraordinary circumstances.

This is a very difficult time for many of our students. They are frightened for their health and for their loved ones. Many have lost employment or are worried about how they can continue their education. Some are worried about housing and even finding sufficient food. Balancing family obligations with their education is even more difficult. Please have empathy and compassion for your students. Listen to their fears and concerns. Help them know of your sincere interest in their well-being, and encourage them as much as you can.

Many of us feel the same anxiety about health and loved ones, and for the future. On top of that, the emotional labor of responding to your students’ very real difficulties can take a toll. Please take good care of yourselves and your colleagues. Please let your chairs, deans, Faculty Excellence, and me know what you need. Email me if you need to talk. And if it can be helpful, please remember that you can take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program.

Those of you on the tenure track may freely ask for a tenure clock extension as a result of the turmoil caused by the pandemic. All requests will be granted.

Remote teaching will continue through the spring semester and into Summer A, C and D. A decision has not been made about Summer B. We have sought to alleviate student stress by giving students the option of choosing S/U grading this spring.

I hope that all of you know of the online resources available, such as the Keeping Teaching website for faculty and the Keep Learning website for students, to help. We have also created a Faculty Toolkit with FAQs and other resources. For the most up-to-date information about the coronavirus developments at UCF, along with more general FAQs for employees, see the UCF Coronavirus website.

We are confronted by extraordinary challenges. More are likely to develop. But I have been lifted up by the response of our faculty and staff these past two weeks. I do believe that, working together, we will continue to hold one another close and serve our students well.

Please stay safe.

University of Central Florida,27-Mar-2020,"A plan to refund housing costs was unanimously approved on Thursday by the university’s Board of Trustees in light of the unprecedented need to ask students not to return to campus to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Refunds will go to students with leases in the Apollo, Libra, Lake Claire, Nike, Hercules and Neptune communities, as well as Towers and Rosen housing. The refunds will include students’ housing costs from March 27 through April 28, the end of the spring semester.

The university also is in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest — which are managed by UCF but privately owned. Details are still being worked out, but both are supportive of offering partial refunds for the spring term.

Students still living on campus as of March 27 will not receive refunds.

In addition, UCF continues to advocate on behalf of our students who reside in privately owned student apartments off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to these individual off-campus properties and management companies.

Refunds will be processed beginning next week.

If housing costs were paid with a credit card, the refund will go back on the credit card. If not, refunds will be posted in eligible students’ accounts and will be shown in myUCF. Most students have their student account linked to a bank through direct deposit. Students who do not have direct deposit are encouraged to sign up by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, and clicking Direct Deposit.

Students who haven’t set up direct deposit before refunds are posted will have checks sent to their mailing address on file with UCF. Students are encouraged to verify the address on file is correct, and to update it if it’s not. Verify or update your mailing address by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, clicking Student Center, and reviewing the Personal Information section.

Any unpaid charges owed to the university will be deducted from students’ refunds.",325,fl,3
University of Central Florida,26-Mar-2020,"Yesterday, UCF announced a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading option that students can choose for their classes. This decision was made after consultation with deans and faculty members because we understand the added stress the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on our students.

Most students will be able to select the S/U option on a course-by-course basis.

Choosing this option may not be wise for students in all circumstances. For example, there may be issues associated with financial aid, meeting major requirements, etc. We are developing additional information to help students decide and to help advisors answer student questions before the opt-in period begins in April.

The S/U grades will not affect GPAs. The grade designation will appear on students’ transcripts with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are continuing to work through the details of providing this option—including determining the period for students to opt-in. Students and faculty and staff members can expect to hear more in the coming weeks.

For now, we are happy to share that this will be an option for our students. UCF is committed to student success, and it is critical that UCF supports our students during this challenging time.

University of Central Florida,25-Mar-2020,"Over the past two weeks, we’ve sent you a lot of information, and you may be feeling confused or overwhelmed. But if there’s one thing I hope has been clear in each message, it’s this: We care about you and want you to stay safe.

Like other college students across the country, you’ve been grappling with the stress of juggling new assignments online, or moving back home, or losing a job, or trying to pay rent, or taking care of family members.

You’ve heard these are unprecedented times — and that you need to take this virus seriously to protect yourself, your friends and your loved ones. That’s one reason Orange County enacted its “stay at home” order for the next two weeks beginning Thursday. That means only going out for essential things like trips to the grocery store, and not to friends’ apartments for dinner.

The strain of all of this is wearing. But we want to help you keep going, and help you take care of yourself not just academically but personally. We will emerge from this COVID-19 crisis — and I know the same grit and determination that resonates with all of us in Knight Nation will help us get through the challenging times ahead.

New Updates on Semester Grading
We’ve heard from students who’ve requested a pass-fail grading option because of this semester’s significant disruptions and worked with academic and faculty leaders across campus to best support students during this difficult time. We’ve also heard from many who are concerned about not receiving a letter grade for their work.

That’s why students will have the option to select — for each of their Spring 2020 courses — whether they would like a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade or a letter grade. This option will be available for students in most undergraduate and graduate programs, except medical students.

Details are still being finalized, but we want you to know that most of you will be able to make this choice. There are important factors to consider when making this decision, and we’ll soon be sharing that and more information about how and when you can select your grading preference.

Ultimately, we hope giving you this option will help ease some of the academic stress you’ve faced with the transition to remote learning.

And for those looking for additional resources to help with their new course formats, we have some helpful tips.

Student Support Services
Along with the switch to remote learning, many of our student support services also have moved online.

For any student who needs it, you can schedule a phone or virtual consultation with UCF’s Counseling and Psychological Services by calling 407-823-2811 or visiting their website.

Student Care Services also continues to work remotely with anyone who needs additional academic or personal support during this time. You also can call Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

And you can learn about more virtual student services, including virtual and livestreaming fitness classes, on our UCF Coronavirus website.

Need Groceries?
UCF’s Knights Helping Knights Pantry is offering students to-go bags with up to 10 food and toiletry items for curbside pickup. If you’re interested in this service, please fill out this form to order a bag.

Curbside pickup is available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the loading dock behind the Knights Pantry in parking lot B9.

Commencement
Our graduating seniors and their families will be happy to know that we have continued to explore alternative ways of celebrating this important milestone.

While UCF — like all other state universities — will not be hosting in-person commencement ceremonies this spring, we will be organizing a virtual commencement for our spring graduates. Details are being worked out and will be shared soon.

Additionally, we are looking at ways to recognize this semester’s graduates at a special rescheduled ceremony later this year. More information on that will come later.

Housing and Refunds
Finally, I want to end with an update related to many questions we have received regarding refunds for on-campus students’ housing and meal plans.

This is an area our team has been extensively working on during the past week. Our Board of Trustees tomorrow will be considering options for refunding a portion of spring housing costs for on-campus student residents. This would include residence halls and housing communities on the main campus and at the Rosen College. We are in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest, and both are supportive of offering partial refunds for the spring term.

UCF is advocating on behalf of our students who reside off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to individual off-campus properties and management companies.

We also hope to have more information to share soon with our students who have purchased meal plans about credits that may be available to them for future use.

These and other important updates will continue to be posted to the UCF Coronavirus website. I encourage you to check it frequently for the latest information and resources to help you during this difficult time.

While we all need to continue practicing social distancing, we also must keep reaching out (virtually) and supporting each other. We have an incredible team of faculty members, administrators, student support staff, advisors, counselors and others who are 100 percent committed to helping you.

And I could not be prouder of how our campus community continues to respond in this most challenging time.

Because together we will … Charge On!

University of Central Florida,25-Mar-2020,"All of us care deeply about our students’ well-being and success. Juggling education, jobs and job loss, family responsibilities, and concerns about the future has become a struggle for many of our students. To alleviate student stress, and after consultation with deans and the Faculty Senate leadership, we have developed a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading option that students can choose for their classes. Today, Interim President Seymour announced this option to students. I am writing to explain what this means for you with more specifics to follow in coming days.

Students will be able to elect satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in any course. Faculty members will continue to assign grades as outlined in the syllabi. At the end of the semester, the grades you submit will be converted by the Registrar’s Office to either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, for students selecting this option. The grade designation will appear on their transcript with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this spring semester because of the pandemic.

Choosing this option might not be wise for a student in all circumstances. For example, there may be issues associated with financial aid, meeting major requirements, etc. We are developing information about these matters to help students decide, and to help advisors answer student questions. It will be important for students to discuss the option with advisors. This information will be available to students and advisors before the opt-in period begins.

In brief, this is how opt-in for students will work:

Undergraduate and graduate students may opt in to S/U grading and may choose during a yet-to-be-determined time in April;
Students may choose course-by-course;
S/U grades will have no effect on GPA;
Courses with “S” grades will count toward degree requirements, but not necessarily toward majors (if, for example, a “B” is required in a certain course in an undergraduate major);
For students who opt in to S/U grading:
Undergraduate grades of “A” through “C” will be replaced by “S;” “C-” and below will be replaced by “U;”
Graduate grades of “A” through “B-” will be replaced by “S;” “C+” and below will be replaced by “U.”
In a very few cases, certain courses may be excluded from this opportunity. I am in discussion with deans about this and other finer details. In addition, the M.D. program, which is on a different academic calendar, is excluded from this program.

More details are coming soon about how students can opt in, deadlines, etc., along with information for students about pros and cons.

The opt-in choice for students recognizes the very difficult time that they and all of us face and upholds UCF’s commitment to student success. I deeply appreciate the adjustments you have made in short order to keep advancing teaching and learning at UCF while navigating the personal challenges of your own. More about supporting faculty during this challenging time will come soon. Thank you.

University of Central Florida,25-Mar-2020,"Orange County is mandating an emergency “stay at home” order that takes effect at 11 p.m. Thursday, March 26, for at least two weeks through 11 p.m. Thursday, April 9. This is an expansion of the previously announced curfew in Orange County and is a concerted effort to reduce further spread of COVID-19.

The order applies to all individuals within Orange County, with exceptions for essential workers and essential activities as outlined in the order. Frequently asked questions are addressed here: newsroom.ocfl.net/2020/03/stay-at-home-to-flatten-the-curve-orange-county-issues-stay-at-home-order-effective-march-26-2020-faqs.

UCF has taken strategic actions to depopulate the campus over the past several weeks.

By tonight, students who reside in UCF Housing should have returned to their permanent residences. Those with extenuating circumstances remaining on campus and students in off-campus housing must abide by the order. Students currently off campus should not return to UCF until further notice.

The period of remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

Starting Friday, March 27, only those employees who have been identified as essential; whose job functions require them to report to campus; and whose supervisors have approved them continuing to work on campus should be at UCF. Only essential employees who meet all three of these criteria will have key card access to campus buildings.  If you are unsure about how this applies to you, talk to your supervisor about what the “stay at home” order entails.

Starting Friday, March 27, through April 9, UCF will provide paid administrative leave to employees who are unable to work on campus and unable to work remotely. This leave applies to faculty, administrative and USPS employees. Beginning April 1, when the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act takes effect, faculty and staff—along with eligible OPS employees—may qualify for emergency leave. All other faculty, administrative, and USPS employees who do not qualify for the federal aid and who cannot work remotely will be provided administrative leave. Employees not available for work due to illness or personal time must take sick or annual leave per UCF policy.

More detailed guidance about the federal legislation will be shared soon with employees, supervisors and HR liaisons.

Additionally, the Office of Research had earlier this month identified and approved researchers who could continue to have limited access to their labs. In response to the “stay at home” order, the list will be further reduced to only allow access to personnel critical to maintaining facility operations. Those individuals will be selected by their college deans or directors and approved by the Vice President of Research. More information will be forthcoming.

University of Central Florida,24-Mar-2020,"UCF is continuing to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and is making decisions in the best interests of our students, faculty and staff members, and our larger community.

We understand that this is a stressful time for you, and we care about your well-being. We also appreciate your patience as we make decisions that prioritize everyone’s safety.

Since sharing recent updates related to Housing, we’ve received many questions from our residents and their families. We’re providing some additional clarity and updated information.

Refunds
We understand the financial stress and uncertainty COVID-19 has caused so many of our students and their families.

Because of that, UCF’s Board of Trustees later this week will be considering options for refunding a portion of spring housing costs for student residents. This would include residence halls and housing communities on the main campus and Rosen. We are in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest — which are managed by UCF but privately owned — regarding refunds.

Once these decisions are reached, we will share this information with our students, as well as continued ways the university will support them in this difficult time.

Residents Who Haven’t Returned
Residents who have not returned to campus since UCF moved to remote instruction following spring break should not come back to campus right now.

These residents will receive instructions about completing their move out at a different time. Their belongings are safe, and no new residents will be moved into their spaces.

At this time, public health officials are advising against any non-essential travel, so residents should not be coming to campus to move out of residence halls. Move out for these residents will be scheduled at a time when risks associated with the further spread of COVID-19 are minimized.

Residents Still on Campus With No Summer Agreement
Residents physically remaining on campus with no summer agreement need to vacate their room by 6 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, unless they are granted an exemption.

These residents should visit the Housing Portal in myUCF to sign up for an appointment time and follow the move out instructions below.

Residents Still on Campus With Summer Agreements
Residents physically remaining on campus with a summer agreement still need to vacate their room by 6 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, unless they are granted an exception.

These residents should visit the Housing Portal in myUCF to sign up for an appointment time and follow the move out instructions below.

At this time, Housing does not know the status of residents’ ability to return for campus for the summer. They are encouraged to use their best judgement on whether to take all belongings, especially if it could be a hardship to get them at a later date.

Instructions for Move Out
Move out for the residents remaining on campus has been structured to allow for social distancing best practices to reduce further spread of COVID-19.

Residents must adhere to the two-hour move out time they selected in the Housing Portal. No more than two people should assist, and it’s especially important that residents not bring anyone who is sick or who has a compromised immune system with them.

Once all belongings have been removed, residents should go to the designated location for key drop-off. Key envelopes will be available, and residents should write their name, PID and room number on the envelope; place their room and mailbox keys inside; and drop the envelope in the key box.

After the resident has removed all their belongings and dropped off their keys, they should complete the Express Check Out Form in the Housing Portal to confirm that they have vacated the space.

Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
We are working quickly to review requests for exemptions also submitted through the Housing Portal for international students unable to travel; residents without permanent housing; and those with other hardships. Please know these are being handled on a case-by-case basis.

These residents will hear directly from Housing about whether they are approved to remain. They may be required to consolidate in a different location on campus, and campus services — including housekeeping — will be extremely limited. Residents who have requested an exception may remain in their space until a decision is rendered, and additional time to move out will be given if a request is denied.

More information will be shared as soon as possible, and residents requesting exceptions should stay tuned to their email.

Off-Campus Housing
Students who live in off-campus housing should contact their individual leasing office for more information.

This also applies to residents in affiliated housing at Knights Circle and the Pointe at Central. While UCF provides residence life services at these properties, respective management companies control leases and payment systems.

UCF is advocating on behalf of our students who reside off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to individual properties and management companies.

Thank you for your cooperation as we navigate this evolving event together. We’re committed to making this as smooth of a process as possible, and we’ll continue to share regular updates with you.",847,fl,3
University of Central Florida,20-Mar-2020,"Today, UCF learned that one of our students has tested positive for COVID-19.

The incubation period for COVID-19 is 14 days, and we believe the risk of anyone who came into contact with him developing symptoms at this point is very low. Out of an abundance of caution, his residence hall and classrooms will be decontaminated for everyone’s safety.

The student is recovering away from UCF, and he has our best wishes for good health.

Additionally, a military contractor who works at the Partnership IV Building in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the main campus has tested positive for the coronavirus. Several of his colleagues also have submitted to tests.

While a small number of UCF Institute for Simulation and Training employees work in the same building, they aren’t believed to have come into contact with the military contractor. The UCF employees have already been working remotely and have been advised to monitor their health. Partnership IV will be closed for two weeks following thorough decontamination.

UCF also is aware of other students who have exhibited symptoms and are being tested and observing self-quarantine. While we believe their risk is low, this is a wake-up call that COVID-19 is at UCF and all of us must be vigilant.

This news hits close to home for UCF. But we must understand that as testing becomes more widely available across Central Florida, the number of positive cases will grow.

The realities of this pandemic are why we have moved to remote instruction for all students and remote work for most employees. COVID-19 is something we must all take seriously.

Social distancing is key in reducing further spread of COVID-19. It’s also important to take personal health precautions, such as practicing proper hand-washing and avoiding touching your face and frequently-touched surfaces.

UCF leadership, including Interim President Thad Seymour, Jr., continues to make decisions in consultation with public health officials and state leaders that prioritize the health and safety of everyone at UCF and in our broader community.

We are sharing answers to frequently asked questions, and resources for help if this news is affecting you here.

University of Central Florida,19-Mar-2020,"COVID-19 remains a global pandemic that we all must take seriously.

A new report from the CDC finds that 38 percent of hospitalized cases in the U.S. are 20- to 54-year-olds, further proof that we need everyone in our campus community — and beyond — prioritizing their personal wellness and practicing social distancing.

As we have done since January, UCF will continue to make decisions with the health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff members, and larger community top of mind, and we’ll communicate these updates to you as we have new information to share.

Academic Calendar and Summer Remote Instruction
Students and advisors should have received notice that UCF is postponing registration for the summer and fall semesters to Thursday, March 26. The withdrawal and reinstatement deadlines also have been extended to Friday, March 27.

These dates are reflected in the Academic Calendar.

Additionally, UCF will continue with remote instruction through the Summer A, C and D semesters, which all start on Monday, May 11.

While we don’t yet know the long-term impact of this pandemic, we wanted to make this decision well in advance of the start of those semesters to give our faculty members and students time to adjust their plans.

Additional information about courses will be shared with students by their college.

Housing
Students who live in residence halls were asked not to return to campus following Spring Break, and those remaining are strongly encouraged to return to their permanent residence as soon as possible. Special accommodations will be made for residents with extreme extenuating circumstances.

However, to ensure social distancing, no residents should formally move out immediately.

Instead, Housing will soon share a plan for staggered move-out appointments that prioritize the safety of students, their families, and staff members. More information will be emailed to residents by Housing in the coming days.

Remote Work for Employees
Whether employees are working remotely or reporting to campus to do your jobs, we want you to continue to work.

It is critical that supervisors and employees work together to identify meaningful work. Tasks might be different from normal responsibilities, but everyone must be creative and flexible, while also remaining mindful of social distancing.

Now is a great time to revisit useful training, including online training, that you couldn’t find the time for previously. Or, consider planning out projects, future events and other department priorities ahead of time. For those on campus, a good use of this time could include completing projects that are easier to do while the campus is depopulated.

This is an unprecedented time that requires outside-the-box thinking. Let’s all be creative with how we use this time to best position our respective areas for the future.

Stay Tuned
With this rapidly evolving situation, UCF continues to follow guidance from state and federal officials to make the best decisions.

UCF and the State University System Board of Governors are reviewing all student services and the impact of moving to an online platform. Since this event affects students, faculty, and staff across all of Florida, any operational and financial decisions are being made with the greatest concern to all impacted.

UCF will share more information about potential reimbursements as soon as it becomes available. We ask for continued patience as we all work through this very difficult and ever-changing situation.

As always, we are committed to sharing regular information at ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus. Please continue to check this site frequently for new updates or answers to common questions.

Although I’ve said it before, thank you. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures — and that also means extraordinary care for those around you. Let’s continue to be kind and patient with one another, and together, I know we will Charge On!

Last week, UCF encouraged all residential students to return to their permanent residence and not return to campus while keeping residence halls open as a last resort for residents who cannot leave. Because of Tuesday’s announcement that UCF is moving to remote instruction through the remainder of the spring semester, and in the interest of continued resident safety; it has become apparent that all students will need to vacate their room soon – you should not move at this time. Do not make arrangements to move out without additional guidance from housing and residence life. By the end of the week, residents will receive additional communication and guidance on how to properly move out.

Limited exceptions will be made for residents with the following extenuating circumstances:

International students unable to travel
Residents without permanent housing
Residents with other hardships to be reviewed on a case by case basis
Instructions on requesting an exception for an extenuating circumstance will be provided later this week.

We understand that this is a stressful time and care about your wellbeing. Because safety is priority, it is critical that students do not formally move out of their residence halls at this time. Housing and Residence Life has developed a move out plan that will encourage reduced interactions and social distancing during the process. It is imperative that residents and their families follow the instructions that will be provided at a later time and will include the selection of a move out appointment.

University of Central Florida,19-Mar-2020,"Earlier this week UCF launched practices for learning and working remotely in an effort to depopulate the campus. Public health officials have said that social distancing is critical in reducing further spread of COVID-19.

This is a period of dynamic change and unprecedented challenge. We must all remain flexible and look for creative solutions to navigate through this time.

Guidance for Supervisors and Employees
Remote instruction will continue through at least the spring semester. Faculty and staff who are working remotely should expect to continue to do so for the immediate weeks ahead.

However, UCF remains open, with employees on campus supporting remote learning, campus operations and other essential areas.

Not knowing the future impact of this pandemic, we understand that finding meaningful work that can be completed either on campus or remotely during this stretch of time can seem difficult. Supervisors are encouraged to find ways to fill employees’ time and keep them productive.

Supervisors should consider tasks that keep employees fully occupied while also exercising social distancing.

For example, for employees working on campus, that might be working on projects that are best completed when buildings are unoccupied. For those working remotely, it could be finding new and creative ways to collaborate or work on old or new projects. For all employees, there may be useful web-based training and professional development.

While UCF works on solutions to address issues that have been brought to HR’s attention, we encourage all supervisors and employees to think outside the box about how to continue working during this unique time.

Federal Work-Study
Today, UCF received clarity from the U.S. Department of Education on Federal Work-Study during the coronavirus pandemic. This guidance allows FWS students to be paid using scheduled work hours for the term without reporting to work, effective this pay period.

This is good news for our students who rely on this federal aid.

Because of the circumstances, students are not required to work during this period, but some may have worked or would like to continue working. Supervisors have the flexibility to allow this, and students will be paid regardless.

As always, the hours that students work should be documented on a timesheet and submitted to payroll for normal processing. UCF Human Resources will be communicating directly with departmental payroll processors and authorizers about how to pay students who are unable to work.

Moving Forward
Teams from across UCF are in regular communication and making decisions about the university’s next steps. We understand that the element of unknown in this situation is frustrating.

While answers don’t come easy, we assure you UCF is committed to making decisions with the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff members, and larger community in mind.

We’re also committed to sharing regular updates as soon as they are available at UCF’s coronavirus website",471,fl,3
University of Central Florida,17-Mar-2020,"Today, several additional key precautions were put in place for campus communities across our state to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The Florida Board of Governors, which oversees state universities, has directed UCF, along with the state’s other public universities, to extend our period of remote learning through the end of the spring semester. This important and necessary action will protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff.

UCF’s team of academic leaders and emergency and health officials has been working diligently for several weeks to make sure our campus could quickly respond to the growing threat of COVID-19, including this large-scale move to remote learning.

Fortunately, UCF has been a long-time leader in digital learning with faculty, staff and students who are among the country’s most innovative thinkers and doers.

Still, these circumstances bring unique challenges, and I encourage our students to work directly with their faculty members to help balance new demands and ways of learning for the rest of the semester.

No decisions yet have been made about the summer terms.

Commencement Ceremonies Canceled
Based on additional direction from the Board of Governors today, we will be canceling our commencement ceremonies scheduled for April 30 through May 2.

This is sad and disappointing news, but we recognize that these ceremonies could not move forward given the social distancing requirements. We understand that commencement ceremonies are a major milestone in the lives of our graduates and the loved ones who have supported them on their educational journey.

That’s why we are evaluating options to include the possibility of celebrating our graduates at a future time, and we will share more information as soon as it’s available.

In the meantime, cap and gown costs will be reimbursed by the vendor, Herff Jones. More information about commencement and reimbursements is available on UCF’s coronavirus website.

Remote Working
Faculty and staff who are working remotely should expect to continue to do so for the immediate weeks ahead. We will continue to keep you informed about remote working guidelines as decisions are made about campus operations for the remainder of the spring semester.

I know all of us realize that these decisions, while extremely difficult, must occur to help protect the health of both our campus community and our community as a whole. We are working hard to do all we can to maximize opportunities for learning and working during what is an unprecedented time in our global history.

This continues to be a quickly changing and evolving situation, and I am so thankful for everyone across campus — from our students to our staff to each of our faculty members — who are working together to make our community a place that prioritizes safety and each other’s well-being.

I know we will continue to persevere and to take care of ourselves, our loved ones and our fellow Knights!

Online classes will continue as usual starting March 16; face-to-face classes will be available in an online format on March 18. More information on clinical courses, recitals and other performances, and other activities that do not as easily lend themselves to virtual environments will be coming soon.

The academic affairs team has been providing more information and resources to faculty about how best to move their courses online and what resources need to be provided to students.

Remote instruction will continue through the summer A, C and D semesters. Because courses are being moved online, students should not to come back to campus during this period of remote instruction. Fourteen days is the period in which secondary transmission to others is thought to be highest, and UCF advises against any additional travel during this time.

Residence halls will remain open only as a last resort to on-campus student residents who have no other place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below, and must let Housing know of their plans by responding to the form in the Housing portal.

All UCF campuses will remain open for employees reporting to work. Student employees should contact their supervisors for guidance.

Closures and Cancellations
UCF will suspend all campus events starting Saturday, March 14, through at least the spring semester.

New events should not be scheduled. Cancellations include all UCF Athletics events, UCF Celebrates the Arts, Knight-Thon, meetings of student organizations, admissions tours and other academic and recreational meetings and events.

Travel & Study Abroad
Earlier this week, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, and global travel is restricted. Everyone is expected to monitor their health, limit interactions with others, and upon showing symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider.

Based on guidance from state and federal officials, UCF is prohibiting all employees’ official university domestic and international travel for the next 30 days. The exception is employee travel between UCF campuses, which remains permitted.

Those with planned university travel will receive an email with guidance on canceling their trip. No Travel Approval Petitions will be approved at this time.

More information about work-related travel is available here: ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/faq.

As UCF has previously shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a country that has a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options. Personal domestic and international travel by all students and employees is strongly discouraged during this unique time in an effort to best protect you and those around you.

UCF already has canceled all faculty-led trips, international exchanges and participation in partner programs for students and staff members for the spring and summer semesters.

Protection and Prevention
COVID-19 can be spread among people and animals.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent the virus and no specific treatment.

COVID-19 appears to spread predominantly through coughing and sneezing from infected persons. Individuals in close proximity to such persons, or who contact objects that have been contaminated with the virus, are at risk of illness.

Coronavirus symptoms are generally flu-like and include fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing.

The virus enters our bodies through contact with our eyes, nose and mouth. If your hands become contaminated with the virus, and you touch those areas, you are at risk of becoming ill. Flu-like symptoms — including fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing — are thought to appear within two to 14 days after exposure. Anyone who has traveled in the past 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should visit their healthcare provider immediately.


While the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, everyone can take these simple steps to prevent the spread of germs.

Steps to prevent the spread of germs
These tips are helpful in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19:

Avoid shaking hands.
Wash hands often with soap and water. You should spend at least 10-20 seconds washing. More information about proper hand washing is available at cdc.gov/handwashing.
As much as possible, avoid touching your face — especially your eyes, nose and mouth — with unwashed hands.
Be cautious about what you touch, and wash your hands after touching any public surface. Avoid grasping shared surfaces such as door handles, gas pumps, grocery carts, elevator buttons, etc. with your hands. Use your knuckles or hips or a paper towel or disposable glove.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or sleeve and clean up immediately.
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.
Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer that is greater than 60% alcohol at home and in your car. Use the sanitizer after touching any public object.
Use disinfectant wipes at stores whenever they are available. Wipe both the handle and child seat of grocery carts.
Avoid contact with those who are sick, and avoid others if you are sick.
In addition, flu vaccines are highly recommended, as it is flu season. Flu shots are available for free to students at Student Health Services, and employees can also receive the shot there for a cost.

Hand sanitizer stations are available across campus, and UCF is adding more to high-traffic areas on campus to encourage use during flu season.

University of Central Florida,16-Mar-2020,"Today, UCF launched new practices for learning and working in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across our nation. For many, that means taking what we do online or finding other ways to best serve our students remotely.

It’s certainly unprecedented for our university, and there’s no doubt that this is a challenging and stressful time. But it’s also an illustration of how resilient we are as a campus and a community.

By Wednesday, we will have transitioned our courses to remote learning thanks to the ingenuity of our faculty members and incredible support from our Center for Distributed Learning. Individual departments also are working directly with their students to help them find ways to best fulfill their clinical, internship or other requirements so they’re disrupted as little as possible while following the best guidance from health officials.

New Remote Working Guidelines
Also by Wednesday, we are transitioning to temporary remote work for at least two weeks for our faculty and staff whose jobs can be performed while off campus. New guidelines for remote work are available here, along with forms and processes for employees and supervisors to follow.

Those who are prepared to work remotely can begin doing so immediately, with approval from their supervisor and after completing the HR form.

Following health officials’ guidance, high-risk employees also should work remotely starting as soon as possible. Those at high risk from COVID-19 include persons age 65 or older; those with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes; those who are pregnant; and those with immunodeficiency from medications or medical conditions.

We also know that not all employees’ jobs can be performed remotely. Some employees will be required to remain on campus because they support remote learning, campus operations or other essential areas.

Supervisors should work with each of their employees to determine what, where and how their duties will be performed.

Frequent communication between employees and their supervisors will be key during this time. To help, UCF HR has put together a thorough online FAQ that addresses a variety of issues for the university’s different types of employees. UCF IT also has developed a helpful guide for employees working remotely.
These and other updates on the university’s response will continue to be posted to UCF’s coronavirus website.

Keeping Each Other Safe
In keeping with guidance from our federal and local health officials, we have a responsibility to take actions that will keep not only our campus but our larger community safe. That means intentionally having a smaller number of people on our campus and practicing social distancing, or avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

With that in mind, we have canceled all campus events, including athletics events, through at least March 30. And, we are evaluating other large-scale events scheduled beyond the next two weeks, including commencement. We will be sharing updates with you soon.

UCF also has resources in place to help you navigate through this stressful time. UCF’s Employee Assistance Program, Health Advocate, is available at 877-240-6863 for free, confidential, 24/7 assistance for all employees, including OPS employees in this special circumstance.

Mental health support is available to all students via Counseling and Psychological Services, which can be reached 24/7 by calling 407-823-2811.

Finally, I would like to thank each of you for your patience and flexibility during this extraordinary time. While we are each doing our very best to take care of our students, let’s also remember to continue to prioritize personal safety and the wellbeing of those around us.

And, most of all, let’s keep Charging On!

University of Central Florida,16-Mar-2020,"On Wednesday, March 18, we are moving the bulk of university operations to remote access, in an effort to keep employees safe. In the area of research, the goal is to minimize or limit the number of people in a site at any given time, while allowing research that is absolutely essential or time-sensitive to continue. I am asking each of you who does research or has a lab to ask yourself whether your research MUST be conducted in a face-to-face setting at the current time.

Faculty with a laboratory need to fill out the Laboratory Access Survey immediately. The survey was released Friday, but I understand that not everyone may have seen it. Please find it here.

In that survey, you are asked to identify people critical to maintaining time-sensitive and necessary lab operations. This is not a guarantee every person will have access, but the survey will help the Office of Research create an authorization list. Only individuals identified on the authorization list will be allowed to enter your lab beginning Wednesday. It is likely that each building on campus will be limited to one entry point beginning that day. These procedures are to implement social distancing and for the safety of our faculty, staff, and students. We reserve the right to limit or stop research that is not consistent with these procedures or poses a health threat to personnel.

I ask that you take a hard look at what lab work can be done remotely and move to that by Wednesday. When considering who should get physical access, ask yourself these questions:

Does the work have to be done right now?
What is the minimum number of people I need in the lab to get critical work done?
For safety reasons we envision no more than two people in any lab at any given time, unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as required safety requirements. A section of the survey allows for you to make that case. Remember to consider your graduate students and post-doctoral scholars as you make decisions.

I know times are difficult and it appears things change daily. Please keep checking the UCF Coronavirus website for all updated information. The Office of Research is also posting research-relevant information and sharing documents with the Provost Office to give you as many access points as possible. We also will be distributing additional information from EHS.

I know everyone believes the research he or she is doing is critical. However, in these unusual times, we need to do what is necessary to keep each other safe. Just remember that we are all human and concerned. All of our efforts are meant to help prevent the spread of this disease and keep you, students, staff and our broader community safe.",462,fl,3
University of Central Florida,16-Mar-2020,"As you all may have seen, today, March 16, is the first day that UCF is moving to remote instruction in an effort to promote safety for all of the UCF community. I’m not going to sugar coat this, I know this isn’t an easy adjustment for a lot of us.

This decision wasn’t made without a lot of considerations — it came after long consultations with medical and community experts that have advised us that this is the best way to move forward to keep everyone safe, which is our top priority in these trying times.

That being said, it is crucial that all students remember that spring break is over, and that we do not confuse an online school experience with an extension of spring break festivities. I urge all students to continue to check their Webcourses frequently and stay up to date with how their courses will be adapted to fit this new structure.

In an email to the student body, Vice President of Student Development and Enrollment Services, Dr. Maribeth Ehasz announced that any approved travel for registered student organizations, including travel previously approved by our Student Government allocations, are canceled. Along with this, all events through at least March 30 are canceled. My sincerest apologies to all RSO’s that are affected by this. I know these trips mean a lot to your organizations, and I share your frustrations that these opportunities are being taken away.

I know for many students this can be extremely difficult and I want to take a moment to empathize with each and every one of your current situations. To any student employee, on or off-campus, who relies on a thriving UCF community for work – we will come back stronger. In the meantime, I urge you to seek out any resources you need to help you, like our Knights Pantry.

To all of our incoming Freshmen and lowerclassmen, I know this isn’t your ideal Spring Semester. You may have been looking forward to many events that are now canceled and are missing out on seeing what a beacon of light UCF really is. Please keep in mind that the future of UCF is still bright, and you will have so much more to look forward to.

To all of our upperclassmen, and especially our graduating seniors, I am sorry and I am right there with you. This semester a lot of “lasts” have been taken from us, and I know how heavy a toll this may be taking on the final months of your college experience. I am in awe of your selflessness in handling this pandemic, and I encourage you all to use this time to reflect on everything you have been able to do during your time at UCF – rather than what we may be missing out on.

We are doing a good thing here. We are helping slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and everyone’s safety is our main concern. We need to band together, support each other, and remember that we will overcome this adversity.

That being said, the CDC has recommended canceling all events with a gathering of over 50 people for the next 8 weeks, and I encourage you all to take these recommendations to heart. UCF has taken courageous steps in an attempt to slow the spread of this pandemic, but it is only effective to the level of which you take this matter seriously.

This is not a time to panic, but to listen to the experts and follow their suggestions about social distancing and practicing good hygiene. In terms of UCF and its efforts, please refer back to Dr. Ehasz’s email, and follow the links she provided to be aware of all the resources UCF can provide to you.

There are still a lot of questions that I don’t know the answer to, but Student Government will continue to do our best to keep everyone’s spirits at ease.

I have great confidence in the UCF community and I know that we will get through this together.

As always, especially during these trying times, Go Knights! Charge On!

 

Sincerely,

University of Central Florida,15-Mar-2020,"More information from Human Resources about implementing remote work will be shared tomorrow. This will include a form that employees who will be working remotely will need to complete and send to HR.

In the meantime, those who are prepared to work remotely can begin doing so tomorrow with approval from their supervisor.

Following health officials’ guidance, high-risk employees also should work remotely starting as soon as possible. Those at high risk from COVID-19 include persons age 65 or older; those with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes; pregnancy; and/or immunodeficiency from medications or medical conditions.

With the exception of employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, all others should be ready to work remotely starting Wednesday.

Some employees will be required to be on campus because they support remote learning, campus operations, and other areas. It is supervisors’ responsibility to appropriately determine which employees have duties that don’t allow them to work remotely.

Because of UCF’s strategic depopulation of campus beginning tomorrow, this will leave a smaller number of employees reporting to work. This move aligns with guidelines for social distancing, which means avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

Helpful IT guidance for employees and supervisors about working remotely is available here: https://ucf.service-now.com/ucfit?id=kb_article&sys_id=c00b93061bd704105cd6b912cd4bcbe3. UCF also will continue to share regular updates here: https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus.",229,fl,3

This rapidly spreading global pandemic is not something to shrug off. Social distancing in our community is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as well as serious — and deadly — impacts on communities and families. Social distancing means avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

To be clear, spring break has ended. UCF is taking these unprecedented steps to protect the well-being of everyone:

Online classes will continue as usual starting Monday, and face-to-face classes will be available in an online format starting Wednesday. Students should stay home and not return to campus during this period.
You will be able to access most campus services remotely.
All events through at least March 30 are canceled, mirroring the period of remote instruction.
Personal domestic and international travel by students is strongly discouraged during this unique time.
Any approved travel for registered student organizations, including travel previously approved by Student Government allocations, is canceled.
Social distancing, good hygiene, and avoiding risks related to travel, event attendance or participation in other activities will not only help to keep you safe, but they’ll benefit everyone around you, including loved ones and friends.

UCF will continue to share regular updates here: ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus.

We know the COVID-19 outbreak presents an added layer of stress and worry for members of our UCF community. For support in this time of heightened stress, information about Counseling Services and Student Care Services can be viewed on their websites.

This is a critically important time for all of us to reinforce a community of care on our campus and support one another. And, as Knights, I know that’s what we will do.

On-Campus Housing
Residence halls will remain open only as a last resort to on-campus student residents who have no other place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below and must let Housing know of their plans by responding to the form in the Housing portal.

We are taking these unprecedented steps because of the immediate need for social distancing, which is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 among our campus community and our families. That means avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

Online classes will continue as usual starting Monday; face-to-face classes will be available in an online format on Wednesday.

Employees
All UCF employees are expected to report to work as usual.

In preparation for the potential that some of our employees may need to work remotely, we are directing all campus departments to begin preparing for that possibility as an additional measure to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

We understand that not all employees’ jobs can be performed remotely. Departments should begin identifying tasks that can be done remotely and those that cannot, as well as determining which employees would still need to report to campus.

Thorough, helpful guidance for employees and supervisors about working remotely is available here: https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/faq/. We are developing additional guidance that we will provide early next week. This will include guidance related to employees in high-risk categories, such as pregnant women and those with serious health conditions.

Travel
Earlier this week, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, and global travel is restricted. Everyone is expected to monitor their health, limit interactions with others, and upon showing symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider.

Based on guidance from state and federal officials, UCF is prohibiting all employees’ official university domestic and international travel for the next 30 days. The exception is employee travel between UCF campuses, which remains permitted.

Those with planned university travel will receive an email with guidance on canceling their trip. No Travel Approval Petitions will be approved at this time. More information about work-related travel is available here: https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/faq/.

As UCF has previously shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a country that has a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options.

Personal domestic and international travel by all students and employees is strongly discouraged during this unique time in an effort to best protect you and those around you.

Campus Events and Activities
UCF will suspend all campus events starting Saturday, March 14, through at least Monday, March 30, mirroring the period of remote instruction. Should the period of remote instruction be extended, the suspension of events would automatically be extended for the same time. New events should not be scheduled.

Cancellations include all UCF Athletics events, UCF Celebrates the Arts, Knight-Thon, meetings of student organizations, admissions tours and other academic and recreational meetings and events.

Academic advising offices will remain operational, but advisors will not meet with students in person until further notice. In order to receive advising support, students should call or email their advisor or advising office to schedule an appointment via phone or video conferencing software.

UCF is taking these steps with the safety and wellbeing of our campus community top of mind. It is imperative that you also prioritize your personal safety by practicing good hand hygiene, limiting your contact with others and contacting your healthcare provider immediately in the event you present flu-like symptoms.

This is a dynamic, stressful situation that requires everyone’s continued flexibility and understanding. UCF is committed to regularly sharing information on UCF’s coronavirus website and communicating through email and UCF Alert.",692,fl,3

Keeping our UCF community safe and informed is our top priority. UCF, and all universities in the State University System, are taking precautions to help minimize the risk of the spread of the coronavirus. We know that social distancing is one of the key ways we can help protect the health of our community, and to this end, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel our upcoming events, including UCF Celebrates the Arts.   

Public offerings from the College of Arts and Humanities, including concerts, recitals, lectures, exhibitions, theatre performances, etc., are cancelled or postponed at least through the end of the Spring 2020 semester. UCF Celebrates the Arts 2020, planned for April 7-19 at Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, is also cancelled.

While this news is disappointing, our primary concern is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, employees and community. We did not make this decision lightly, as we recognize the preparation already invested into these events and the educational value of the students’ presentations. However, this altered schedule allows everyone to focus on individual health and the welfare of the community at-large.

While all UCF campuses will remain open with employees reporting to work, we are advising our students to stay at home and not return to campus during that time.

These are unprecedented steps that significantly impact how we learn, teach and operate. But as the number of Florida cases of COVID-19 continues to increase, the safety and wellbeing of our campus community must be our No. 1 priority, especially as students and faculty prepare to return from spring break.

Teams of university officials — everyone from emergency management and health officials to academic and student support leaders — are working together to quickly finalize more details so that we can share them with you by the end of this week.

The most up-to-date information always will be available on UCF’s coronavirus website and pushed to the entire campus community through email and UCF Alert.

Online Instruction and Research
Our academic affairs team, for example, has been providing more information and resources to faculty about how best to move their courses online and what resources need to be provided to students.

While all current online courses will continue as usual, courses in other modalities, including face-to-face, will be canceled Monday and Tuesday. All faculty are expected to have their courses available to students online by Wednesday, March 18. More information on clinical courses, recitals and other performances, and other activities that do not as easily lend themselves to virtual environments will be coming soon.

The Office of Research also will continue to provide guidance directly to faculty researchers regarding their ongoing work and labs over the next two weeks.

Housing
While we have advised students not to return to campus for two weeks beginning Monday, residence halls will remain open only for on-campus student residents who do not have an alternative place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below.

Housing will be reaching out to students who live on campus with further information and instructions for those who will be returning.

Travel
As UCF has previously shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a country that has a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options.

Those who have traveled to CDC Level 2 countries or taken a cruise should monitor their health, limit interactions with others for 14 days after returning to the U.S., and immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider upon showing symptoms.

UCF already has canceled all faculty-led trips, international exchanges and participation in partner programs for students and staff members for the spring and summer semesters.

Colleagues:

The Board of Governors, to minimize health risks from COVID-19, has directed state universities to move courses to remote delivery and advise students not to return to campus following spring break. Today, UCF advised students to remain away from campus for two weeks starting Monday, March 16. Under current plans, which are fluid, students are to return on Monday, March 30. Faculty and other employees are to report to work as usual (unless the travel restrictions apply).

All current online courses will continue as usual. Courses in other modalities, including face-to-face, will be canceled Monday and Tuesday. Faculty teaching other modalities must take steps to make them available to students online by Wednesday, March 18. Online teaching will be required for at least two weeks.

This has been a rapidly evolving situation, and today’s information is different from what you received only yesterday. Because of that, we ask and expect that you will frequently check your email and the UCF Coronavirus website for updates.

Meanwhile, beginning immediately, the following is required:

● Take steps to move your face-to-face and other courses to fully online delivery by Wednesday, March 18, using the resources below. Explore the resources, experiment with options, and seek help as needed from the Webcourses@ucf support team (https://cdl.ucf.edu/support/webcourses).

● Review the new “Keep Teaching” website, which offers options to help you move courses online as easily as possible. Resources include self-paced training on online course essentials.

● Watch the “Getting Started” workshop video. A recorded session will be available on the “Keep Teaching” website before the end of this week. If it is not posted when you access “Keep Teaching,” please continue checking as the site is periodically updated.

● Consider joining additional workshops next week that will allow faculty to ask questions. While these sessions will be offered live at the Faculty Multimedia Center (Main Campus, CB1-202), faculty are encouraged to follow social distancing guidelines and attend remotely:
— Tuesday, March 17, 3-4 p.m.
— Wednesday, March 18, 2-3 p.m.
— Thursday, March 19, 10-11 a.m.
— Friday, March 20, 2-3 p.m.

No registration is required. Each workshop will be live-streamed on the “Keep Teaching” website and recorded for review. Additional workshops will be scheduled as needed.

● Consider “open lab” assistance. The Webcourses@ucf support team will be on-site in the Faculty Multimedia Center (CB1-202) for individual walk-in support this week and next. For remote support sessions, please set an appointment.

We will continue to keep you informed of new developments. Remember, for the latest updates (not only about teaching), see UCF’s Coronavirus website.

I appreciate your flexibility during this difficult time and ask that you please be creative over the next two weeks in providing a high-quality experience. Finally, please have compassion for students for whom this will be a challenge.

University of Central Florida,11-Mar-2020,"While no cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported at UCF, the university continues monitoring the virus’ spread and evaluating the many impacts it may have on our campus community.

UCF is developing plans for modified operations should Coronavirus more directly impact the university. Campus is not expected to close. Essential campus operations would continue, with remote work and online class options should conditions require.

University officials continue to meet regularly on prevention efforts and planning for UCF using updated guidance from our state and federal health partners. Keeping our campus community safe and informed is our top priority.

Information and other resources will continue to be shared on UCF’s Coronavirus website, which will be updated as COVID-19 evolves or more directly impacts the university.

University Travel
In keeping with federal guidance, UCF has added Azerbaijan, China, Hong Kong, Italy, Iran, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Turkmenistan to its restricted destinations. All study abroad and university travel to these countries has been canceled, and we anticipate more countries will be added to this list as the virus spreads.

Because of that and out an abundance of caution, UCF is canceling all study abroad trips planned through the summer semester.

If you have returned from one of these countries in the past two weeks — or will soon be returning from one of these countries, please immediately contact Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

Event Guidance
While the campus’ operations remain normal, we are closely monitoring state guidance as it relates to event cancelations. We encourage you to consider alternatives to face-to-face meetings, such as livestreaming, for in-person events.

Other factors to consider based on the CDC’s guidance are:

Necessity of event;
attendance size and whether a significant number of participants are expected to travel to or from the region for this event;
the age and health of expected attendees, particularly older individuals; and
financial impact of cancelation and contract obligations.
Questions about the necessity of events should be directed to your dean or vice president.

As public health guidance evolves, the university may postpone or cancel upcoming events in prioritizing health and wellbeing. University officials also are reviewing existing upcoming events that have registered using the SAFE form and may be reaching out to event organizers with additional questions or guidance.

Courses and Academic Activities
While there are no immediate plans to move all courses online because of COVID-19, the university has been making plans if it is necessary to do so.

Faculty are receiving instructions and resources for shifting their coursework online. If this were to occur, the university community would immediately be notified of the change. Students would be expected to work directly with their faculty members to continue their studies.

Finally, we appreciate our campus community’s commitment to supporting each other during this time.

We understand that this situation can be stressful and these decisions have far-reaching impacts. We also know that we must do what is in the best interest of keeping all Knights safe, and we’ll continue to share precautionary measures and updates with you.

What types of changes can I make to my protocol that do not require IRB approval?

In general, changes that:

a) Are temporary in nature in order to limit subject exposure to the virus. This means that when this crisis is over, you will return to all pre-crisis procedures.
i) Change on interaction methods, such as changes from face-to-face to over the phone or some other similar devices.
ii) Please remember that this change can only be implemented if it presents no greater risk to participants. For example, if your study was taking place in person to avoid the risk by direct observations of the research subjects, a change to over the phone would not be permitted without a formal review by the IRB in the form of a modification.
b) Do not add any additional risk to any subjects or study staff.
c) You should make a note in your study records regarding the above mentioned minor temporary change(s) that were made along with the justification in case you are ever audited.

What type of changes “must” be approved by the IRB prior to implementing them?

In general, changes that:

a) Are not being made as a direct result of the COVID-19 crisis, no matter how minor.
b) Are greater-than-minimal risk changes that are a result of the COVID 19 crisis.
c) Are on the protocol that is a greater-than-minimal risk study.

What if the greater-than-minimal risk revision can’t wait for IRB approval?

If it is in the best interest of the subject, and will minimize or prevent transmission of COVID 19, then make the change, however:
a) You should immediately notify the IRB by email.
b) You should make a note the change(s) in your study records with the justification.
c) You must submit the revision of protocol with the change(s) to the IRB as soon as possible, noting that the revision was implemented because of an emergency, including the justification for that emergent change(s).

What if there is a desire or need to keep a temporary COVID-19-related change a permanent change?

a) If the change is consistent with item #2 above, then initiate the change and submit the revision.
b) When you submit the revision, please include in the description of the revision that the change was already implemented, and the reason it was implemented “emergently”.

What if you decide to suspend your study until the COVID-19 crisis is over?

a) There is no need to inform the IRB. However,
i) If your study is a greater-than-minimal risk study that involves some type of patient care, you must ensure your suspension does not increase any risk to those study subjects.
ii) If possible, make sure you contact any study subject who will be affected by this suspension (ie a study visit will be canceled, etc.)
b) You should make a note in your study records of this temporary suspension along with the justification and any actions taken in case you are ever audited.

If you have any additional questions, contact IRB. Please be patient as we anticipate a large volume of requests at this time.",646,fl,3
University of Central Florida,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues:

UCF continues to prepare for potential impacts on our courses from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Now is the time to make the necessary plans for your courses in case of widespread illness or even the need to move all classes fully online. We are writing to let all faculty know that we expect you to take the actions outlined below.

Adjust course policies related to attendance so that ill students, or students who have been advised to self-quarantine, do not feel compelled to attend. This may require changes in the syllabus that would then need to be shared with students on Webcourses@UCF (Canvas). Also, please be considerate about student needs to make up work or complete it remotely.
Plan now for how to move your face-to-face courses to online delivery using the resources below. Explore the resources, experiment with options (including trying from home), and seek help as needed from the Webcourses@ucf support team. You may also choose to move online before it is required; notify your chair or director by email if you do so. (But if you plan to use Zoom, please wait until it is available.) The following resources are in place to help:
● The new “Keep Teaching” website offers options to help you move courses online as simply as possible. Resources include a self-paced training video on online course essentials.

● The Center for Distributed Learning will conduct four workshops next week to help faculty move courses online:
— Tuesday, March 17, 3-4 p.m.
— Wednesday, March 18, 2-3 p.m.
— Thursday, March 19, 10-11 a.m.
— Friday, March 20, 2-3 p.m.
These sessions will be in the Faculty Multimedia Center (Main Campus, CB1-202). No registration is required. Each workshop will be live-streamed on the “Keep Teaching” website and recorded for review.

● The Webcourses@ucf support team can help schedule a custom training workshop for you, your program, department or college.

We will continue to keep you informed of new developments. For the latest updates (not only about teaching), see UCF’s Coronavirus website.

The news is flooded with updates about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, and we want to assure you we are continuing to monitor the situation. For the latest information and instructions visit UCF’s website dedicated to this issue. Our first priority is your safety and that of our campus community. We know you likely have concerns about the impact the outbreak may have on your research work.

Now is a good time to evaluate how your work in the lab or in the field may be impacted should conditions necessitate. Think weeks, not days. What research is essential and must be completed in the lab? Can your work be done remotely? How many people truly need access to the lab and how often? Are there special safety concerns? These are some of the questions you should be asking to prepare your mitigation plan.

Should face-to-face classes and events be canceled, access to campus and your labs may become limited, and you want to position yourself in the best way to weather disruptions with the least possible impact. The Office of Research is working hand-in-hand with university leadership to plan logistics as necessitated by the outbreak. We are also in communication with sponsor agencies to understand and communicate their responses.

Here is what you can count on from UCF. We will maintain power and telecommunications functions. UCF is closely working with the Florida Department of Health, the CDC, and other local and national agencies. We will communicate through the dedicated website https://www.ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/ and email.

What should you do now?
• If you have any changes for contacts in your labs, update your emergency information with EHS through the EHSA Login tab.
• Identify who is essential personnel in your lab.
• Figure out what work can be done remotely.
• Identify procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention.
• Assess and prioritize critical laboratory activities.
• Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed, or delayed.
• Identify personnel able to safely perform essential activities.
• Ensure that you have access to contact information for your critical staff.
• Cross-train research staff to fill in for others who may be out sick or unable to come to work.
o Ensure staff have the appropriate/required training.
o Consider documenting critical step-by-step instructions.
• Coordinate with colleagues who have similar research activities to identify ways to ensure coverage of critical activities.
• Review contingency plans and emergency procedures with researchers and staff.
• Maintain a sufficient inventory of critical supplies that may be impacted by global shipping delays.
• Consider installing remote control monitoring devices for critical equipment (-80C freezers, liquid nitrogen storage dewars, incubators). Contact EHS if you need help with these devices.
• Identify work that can be done from home or remotely, such as data analysis.
• Test and update remote work technologies such as VPN and Zoom conferencing.
• Remind staff to stay home when they are not feeling well.
• Consider avoiding in-person meetings. Use remote options such as Zoom conferencing.

Keep in mind that if an outbreak is extensive across the nation, there will be many challenges that could impact your research work.
• People who work in your laboratory may be out sick or unable to come to work.
• Orders for critical supplies may be delayed.
• Processing of visas by the federal government may be delayed, resulting in delayed appointments.
• Core facilities and other fee-for-service resources may not be available.
• Repairs performed by facilities and other service providers may be delayed.
• Decontamination of your workspace may be necessary in the event of a local illness.

All of us are following the rapidly evolving news about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Although we hope that UCF will continue running as normal, the university is committed to being prepared. We must consider the possibility of students, staff, and faculty falling ill or being placed in isolation, and even the possibility of canceling face-to-face classes. Before spring break begins, I want to inform you about planning that is underway to allow us to continue to serve our students well.

UCF’s top priority is the personal safety of our faculty, students and staff. On Tuesday, UCF launched a website that provides prevention and health tips, helpful resources, FAQs, and regular updates about the Coronavirus and its effects. Urgent information is frequently distributed through UCF Alerts, so please be sure your information is current in myUCF. A Coronavirus information module has also been added to the UCF Mobile App.

We have not yet been significantly affected by COVID-19, and we do not know whether this will rise to a level that requires UCF to implement any significant response. However, this is the time to make contingency plans. University-wide plans are being developed (e.g., travel, working from home, etc.). Here is some of the planning underway for academic matters: 

One step is important in the short run: Please consider relaxing attendance policies so that ill students do not feel compelled to come to class. It will be important to take this step before we know it is needed and to protect our entire community.
If conditions require, we will move all possible courses online. UCF’s Center for Distributed Learning is developing a comprehensive website with tools and resources that will allow you to quickly shift online if this becomes necessary. This information will be shared with you after spring break. In the meantime, please think creatively about how to teach your courses if classes cannot meet in person.
We are also examining solutions for research laboratories if these conditions occur.
More detailed plans will follow. Thank you for taking the steps needed to provide students with the exceptional education they deserve.",353,fl,3

Protection and Prevention

COVID-19 symptoms are generally flu-like and include fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing. Symptoms are thought to appear within two to 14 days after exposure, and a person can be contagious but not symptomatic.

While the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, everyone can take these simple steps to prevent the spread of germs:

Wash hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. More information about proper hand washing is available here: cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue or your elbow and dispose of tissue immediately.
Avoid contact with those who are sick, and avoid others if you are sick.
If you’re feeling sick, stay home. Do not risk your health or the well-being of others by trying to “tough it out.”
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.
Avoid grasping shared surfaces such as door handles, gas pumps, grocery carts, elevator buttons, etc. with your hands. Use your knuckles or hips or a paper towel or disposable glove.
Avoid shaking hands.
Flu vaccines are highly recommended, as it is flu season. Flu shots are available for free to students at Student Health Services, and employees can also receive the shot there for a cost.

Hand sanitizer stations are available across campus, and UCF is adding more to high-traffic areas on campus to encourage use during flu season.

Berkeley,18-May-2020,"We are writing today to share news about budget-related implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we have shared previously, the loss in current and projected revenues to the campus is significant; combined with actual and projected increased expenses, the total impact will likely be in the range of $210-300 million.

While there has been progress in finding new ways to generate revenue for the campus and our philanthropic gains have been significant, it is clear we will need to take actions within our control to cut expenses in order to reduce the pandemic-related impact to the campus budget. The largest portion of our budget, approximately 68 percent, is personnel costs. Of those costs, the merit increases for non-represented staff and annual cost-of-living increases for represented staff and faculty (range adjustments) account for $50 million annually on our campus alone.

UC President Janet Napolitano will propose to the Board of Regents this week that there be a systemwide freeze on the salaries of non-represented staff and faculty for fiscal year 2021. This does not apply to retention, promotion, and other faculty advancement cases with July 1, 2020 effective dates. This also does not apply to equity increases for staff, but they will be granted on a limited basis and must be approved by the Finance Committee. The process for requesting approval will be released in the coming days. In addition, President Napolitano will propose that she and the 10 campus chancellors each take a 10 percent pay cut. Finally, UCOP is initiating discussions with union leaders to convey the gravity of the system’s financial circumstances. Here is a link to the UCOP announcement and Frequently Asked Questions page.

We realize that this news comes at a time when many of you have health and financial concerns for yourself and your loved ones, are struggling with being separated from friends and family, and are experiencing the fragility and uncertainty that has become all too real during this pandemic. We regret that this announcement will present an additional unwelcome burden.

Please be assured that we will continue to look at all other means of budget relief that do not adversely impact our employees. We are deeply grateful for the many and varied contributions of our UC Berkeley faculty and staff, especially during these very challenging times, and we will continue to support you in any way that we are able.",397,cal,5

Graduation 2020
Meet the top graduate, and more

But graduating in 2020 is anything but typical. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, we face both the dangers wrought by the virus as well as the massive societal and economic upheaval that is accompanying its spread. These are sobering reminders that we are not the sole authors of the stories of our lives. We share that credit with a capricious collaborator called circumstance.

In the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, the protagonist, Frodo, laments that a great evil has come to Middle Earth and wrenched him away from his tranquil existence. “I wish it need not have happened in my time,” he sighs.

His friend and mentor, the wizard Gandalf, responds with tenderness and wisdom: “So do I, and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”

“
The pandemic and its effects have been thrust upon us all, and the only thing in our power is how we choose to respond.”

– – Chancellor Carol Christ

This, of course, is the test that lies before you, your peers, your loved ones, even me: The pandemic and its effects have been thrust upon us all, and the only thing in our power is how we choose to respond. We can let these weighty circumstances hold us down, or we can decide to pick ourselves back up, to adapt, to push onward. Trials such as this are opportunities to cultivate habits of mind that will serve us for all time: courage, ingenuity, resilience, patience, humility, grace, and gratitude.

Already, these traits have been on full display as your class has navigated the monumental transformations of the last several weeks. Some of you kept up your studies even as you took on the role of full-time teacher to younger siblings, as you cared for elder relatives, as you struggled through the suddenly dire challenges of a poor internet connection, or as you woke at 5 a.m. for class in a different time zone. Given the circumstances, your efforts to reach this day are nothing short of heroic. The Class of 2020 will go down in the history books as one that achieved greatness in the face of unprecedented turmoil.

This very celebration, the Blockeley commencement, is a testament to how you have sought out light within darkness. When our campus decided to postpone an in-person spring commencement ceremony, Bjorn Lustic – on a break from his studies at Cal – saw a social media post jokingly asking for someone to build a campus in Minecraft so that students could receive their diplomas digitally.

Well, he thought … why not try? Recruiting a friend and their siblings, Bjorn got to work on the re-creation of California Memorial Stadium that we’re standing in today. As the group shared their progress, excitement grew, and soon hundreds of Berkeley students and alumni were working hand-in-virtual-hand to construct the entire campus from the ground up.

Ultimately, they created something exquisite, detailed, and beautiful. More than that, though, they gave Cal students who had been scattered across the globe a way to vividly experience Berkeley. They offered these students a chance to reconnect with the places they cherished: the magnificent beaux arts buildings like Doe Library and Wheeler Hall, the bustling student union, shaded bridges across Strawberry Creek, a sunlit memorial glade, the stately campanile towering over it all.


A message to the class of 2020 from Chancellor Carol Christ. (UC Berkeley video by Stephen McNally)
In his book In Search of Lost Time, the author Marcel Proust finds that memories are often triggered by our senses, by what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. A bite of a madeleine cookie brings rushing back to Proust childhood trips to see his aunt, who would give him a piece of her own madeleine on Sunday mornings before Mass. Other experiences are reawakened within him when he sees steeples on the rural horizon, or feels uneven paving stones beneath his feet.

Returning to campus – whether virtually today, or in person at a later date – stirs up these kinds of memories within each of us. Walking around Berkeley, or Blockeley, you encounter the backdrop of your college career. The episodes that spring to mind are both shared and deeply personal, for each of us fills in the details, and colors in the figures, according to our own experience. As you pass Moffitt, you may recollect certain moments with friends as you studied late into the evening, or walking by Haas Pavilion, remember the roar of the crowd as you cheered for the Golden Bears in a game against Stanford. Perhaps you’ll recall the way a partner smiled on a first date in a Bancroft cafe; or think back to the crunch of your own footsteps on a quiet walk through Tilden Park on a moonlit evening.

“
This very celebration, the Blockeley commencement, is a testament to how you have sought out light within darkness.

For the poet William Wordsworth, memories like these are powerful sources of pleasure that can carry a person through the most troubled of times. His poem “Tintern Abbey”, describing a visit to a countryside on the banks of the River Wye after many years away, is in some ways a somber reflection on the loss of youth and the passage of time. Yet he finds that memories of his life are also emotional bastions, the bearers of “tranquil restoration” in moments of turmoil. He claims: “I have owed to them, / In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, / Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart.”

Though your college career is reaching its end, I hope you will carry Berkeley with you – in the connections you’ve made, in the lessons you’ve learned, in the memories you feel in the blood and along the heart. I hope that this institution can remain a source of peace, calm, and hope for you in troubled times – and a place to which you will return often, both in person and in your mind’s eye.

Members of the class of 2020, as you enter a society that is facing unprecedented tumult, these places of solace will have even more meaning for you. Find in them the strength that will allow you to face a world that has been torn apart, and to re-envision and reshape it into one that is more just and more beautiful.

May the education you have received at Berkeley serve not just your lives but your society well. May your years ahead be richly rewarding and fulfilling, and may you enjoy much happiness. We are immensely proud of what you have done, and even more, of who you will become.

Spring commencement is one of UC Berkeley’s happiest events. But this year, along came COVID-19. Campus buildings emptied, lights went off, doors locked and students, staff and faculty disappeared. So did hopes for the massive Saturday, May 16 ceremony in California Memorial Stadium, and the rest of this month’s graduation festivities.

But Berkeley’s newest graduates will hardly be forgotten. Starting this Friday night, lights will be turned on — blue and gold ones, shining from campus landmarks — for sheltered-in-place students to see on social media. On Saturday, Chancellor Carol Christ will email video congratulations to all grads. And any well-wisher can visit a special website that day to post photo, video and written tributes to the Class of 2020.

The graduates’ most amazing gift, however, will be from a team of more than 100 of their peers. At 2 p.m. on Saturday, they can attend a virtual, mock commencement ceremony in the stadium — complete with “Pomp and Circumstance,” the chancellor, the conferring of degrees, “Hail to California” and flying mortarboards. It will happen within Blockeley University, a fantastical recreation of the campus built by Berkeley students and alumni using Minecraft, a video game many of them first played as tweens.

A two-day Blockeley Music Festival will follow, starting at 4 p.m. on Saturday, with 40 artists performing on a Blockeley University stage. Donations to the event will go to Off Their Plate, a COVID-19-related grassroots effort that’s reviving restaurant jobs while providing meals to health care workers.

All the festivities will be livestreamed on Twitch. Those with Minecraft accounts can join in-game from anywhere in the world by entering a Blockeley server ip address in the Minecraft multiplayer tab. They’ll be able to move about, even fly, through campus, where more than 100 buildings have been painstakingly reinvented, as have tiny details, from the Campanile’s falcon chicks to Kiwibots to boba shops to campus banners for the current “150 Years of Women at Berkeley” observance.

“Our priority, for the graduating class this year, was to provide a sense of closure, especially now that we’re in such a weird time that brought an abrupt end to senior year,” said Bjorn Lustic, who invented Blockeley University after seeing a March 15 Facebook post suggesting a virtual graduation in Memorial Stadium built on a Minecraft platform.

“For me,” added Nick Pickett, a graduating senior on the Blockeley University team, “working on this has definitely been a coping mechanism (during the pandemic), a way for me to express my love for Cal and to celebrate my graduation, my four years here.”

At the simulated event, Christ and Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher will appear in-game to give speeches, along with speakers Lustic and fellow builder Nga Nguyen; Lydia Winters, head of brand vision and strategy for the global Minecraft franchise; Justin Kan, co-founder of live video platforms Justin.tv and Twitch; and Min-Liang-Tan, co-founder of gaming hardware company Razer Inc.

“If you had asked me a month ago what Minecraft was, … I would’ve told you it was the art of working in a mine,” said Christ. “Now that our students have constructed the incredible Blockeley campus, I know better! It will be an honor to participate in the once-in-a-lifetime ceremony on Saturday.”

Fisher quipped that, the first time he saw his avatar, he thought it bore “an uncanny resemblance” to himself. He said he’s impressed at how the student team has built in six weeks a campus that was “slowly pieced together over the course of about 150 years.”

“When I heard they pulled data from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to generate the terrain with pinpoint accuracy,” he added, “I thought, ‘I might need to see if our campus architect is hiring.’”

Students revive favorite middle school game
Many of Blockeley University’s student builders are old pros at Minecraft, a so-called “sandbox game” that lets players control their own fun, or objectives. A cognitive science major on leave from Berkeley this semester, Lustic first played in 2010, as a Marin County 8th grader.

“It’s a freeing thing, and unique,” he says of Minecraft, admitting it became such a creative and social outlet for him in high school that his parents would yell, “Why are you staying up so late? You have school tomorrow!” “Yeah,” he said, “it was an obsession.”

He didn’t have time for Minecraft at Berkeley, with his studies and Cal Men’s Crew schedule. But when COVID-19 hit, courses went online and in-person graduation ceremonies were dropped, Lustic said he decided to build Memorial Stadium with friend Hunter Hall, a current Berkeley student, just to produce “a little ceremony, maybe having Minecraft avatars walking across (a stage).”

In no time, their siblings and about a dozen others had joined in. The stadium was built in three days, said Lustic, “and then I-House, then the law school, then the Campanile, and then all these buildings were popping up, and we thought maybe doing the campus was feasible.”

Pickett, from San Diego, started playing Minecraft at 13 — “I grew up on Legos, and this is like Legos, but infinite,” he said — but stopped after 10th grade. In college, as a tuba player in the Cal Band, he said his band member roommates threw the occasional Minecraft party, but that he didn’t return to the game until he saw photos posted of what Lustic and the earliest crew members were building.

“About a week after they finished Memorial Stadium,” he said, “I saw a photo of North Tunnel, …which is an emotional place, a second home for us (in the Cal Band)” while waiting to rush onto the football field. He said the tunnel built in Minecraft looked “very off, and I was kind of distraught. …I joined the builders’ group then and there.”

Two weeks later, “we knew we wouldn’t finish the entire campus on time,” said Pickett. A call was put out for more builders, “and I started a Discord (group-chatting platform) to coordinate and organize everyone into a more complex structure,” said Pickett, who was put in charge of making sure various buildings got done on schedule.

Today’s massive team of Blockeley University builders “is a ball screaming down a hill at a little over 100 (people),” he said.

Most of them are STEM majors — the group took a poll – and only a handful are women, like freshman Nga Nguyen, a Minecraft player since she was 12. “It’s 100% still a thing with my peers,” she said. “It’s a great way to spend time with friends, while simultaneously relieving the stress of impending adulthood.”

Nguyen, a chemical biology major from Southern California, said she’s built or helped construct Dwinelle, Sproul, Bowles, Lewis and Mulford halls, the stadium, International House, Maxwell Family Field, the law and business schools, Foothill residence hall, the Genetic and Plant Biology building and Doe Library.

She’ll also be a guest speaker at the virtual ceremony, proud to be one of the few women builders of Blockeley University and to have accomplished this at Berkeley as it celebrates the outstanding women in its 150-year history.

Elliot Choi, a senior majoring in economics and data science who oversees many of Blockeley University’s different project teams, was introduced to Minecraft about 10 years ago by a cousin. At the time, an account cost about $12, compared to around $27 today.

Graduating senior Nick Pickett, a Cal Band tuba player who designed the North Tunnel at California Memorial Stadium for Blockeley University, says that most of the project’s 100 or so builders have never met in person. “The second this whole (COVID-19) thing resolves, we’re all (going to have to meet) in Berkeley,” he said. (Photo by Carmen Adams)

“My dad is a software engineer; he helped my friends and me set up our own Minecraft server, which regularly had 60 to 70 players, which was pretty high for back then,” said Choi, who is from West Hills, California. “I also was able to set up a donation system to keep upgrading the server. I made about $1,200 in my second year of running it.”

In high school, he said, “I don’t think it was as much of a craze as it is right now, and most people weren’t very open about playing it.”

When he saw a Facebook post about a Minecraft commencement at Berkeley, “I thought it was a joke and forgot about it for a week,” he said. “Then Bjorn and Hunter’s mutual friend added me to a group chat with Bjorn. I joined Bjorn’s server and did most of the bleachers and walls of Memorial Stadium … and the shell of I-House, because I spent a lot of time in the dining hall there.” Choi coined the word “Blockeley” in mid-March and helped transfer the burgeoning files from Lustic’s server to a more stable web hosting service.

President of Golden Records, an electronic music industry club at Berkeley, Choi also thought up this weekend’s Minecraft music festival. He reached out to alumnus Johan Yang, of Beauz, a DJ/music producer duo, “and from there it really took off. We started getting interest from A-list artists around the world, and currently, we’ve reached a point where we’ve had to make a waitlist.”

Virtual, but heartfelt, tributes across campus
Berkeley’s graduates are spending a lot of time online this month, not only wrapping up remaining coursework, but checking out video tributes and participating in Zoom events created for them by their academic schools, units, departments and organizations as they shelter at home.

The College of Environmental Design (CED), for example, will launch on May 17 a virtual yearbook where its grads can create a personal profile they can share, and that alumni can see, for recruiting efforts. It also will include speeches, student essays and CED’s annual CIRCUS showcase of exemplary student work. A printable version will be designed by Berkeley landscape architecture professor Richard Hindle.

A virtual celebration for engineering graduates and their families and friends is on May 19. The self-guided event will include recorded video remarks from the College of Engineering’s dean and department chairs, as well as personalized slides for each graduate.

This Saturday, Cal Athletics will stream the “Cal Athletics Senior Celebration: A Recognition of Student-Athlete Success,” with guest speakers Christ, Director of Athletics Jim Knowlton, Rugby Head Coach Jack Clark and rugby student-athlete Robert Paylor, a graduating senior who suffered a spinal cord injury at a game in 2017 and is one of five recipients of the 2020 National Association of Academic and Student-Athlete Development Professionals’ Wilma Rudolph Student-Athlete Achievement Award.

A tradition at Cal Performances’ end-of-school-year celebration for its student workers will continue this Sunday. Each year, graduates on the 40-member Front of House team — students who take tickets and help guests at events — receive leis made of performance-related items, like tickets, caution tape, program notes, ear plugs, glow sticks and headliners’ photos.

This year, the leis are being delivered to grads, so they can wear them at the event, to be held virtually, and 2020 pandemic-era supplies — hand sanitizer and a mask — were woven in.

Right now, staying close and connected to others is tough, but Berkeley’s graduation events all contain a healthy dose of heart, in hopes of keeping and deepening graduates’ ties to the campus and each other while sheltered at home, no matter where they are worldwide.

Even at quirky, yet ethereal Blockeley University, it’s impossible not to be pulled into the emotionality of the landscapes. Students have dreamed them up, depicting what they love about Berkeley and its landmarks — on blue sky mornings, at fiery sunsets, on starry nights and even in the Bay Area’s thick fog — and the little things, like a llama on Memorial Glade, where students occasionally are treated to visits from therapy llamas, to fight academic stress before finals.

Lustic, who took this semester off, feeling lost, said the project, which grew beyond anything he’d imagined and introduced him — albeit virtually — to dozens of new students and alumni, helped him “finally understand that Berkeley has so much to offer.”

“Forming this Blockeley community really invigorated me and showed me the minds of my peers at Cal,” he said. “I don’t know where else you meet these kinds of kids. It makes me want to come back, for sure.”",2435,cal,5
Berkeley,12-May-2020,"Last Tuesday, our campus participated in #GivingTuesdayNow, a global day of giving that was launched to help support those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We write today to offer an update on the success of that drive, to share other campus efforts to support vulnerable members of our community, and to encourage students in need to apply for aid if you have not already done so. Please visit the COVID-19 emergency relief fund portal to identify and apply for all of the funding for which you may be eligible.

Student Emergency Fund

As we reported last week, Kathy Kwan – a generous UC Berkeley alumna – kicked off our #GivingTuesdayNow drive by committing $1 million to emergency financial support for Berkeley students. She also challenged other alumni, parents, donors, and community members to build upon her generosity by raising an additional $1 million for the Student Emergency Fund.

Since Tuesday, we have heard from many donors inspired by Kathy’s challenge, and we are pleased to announce that more than 2,000 individuals have stepped up to support the fund, which offers direct financial support to Berkeley undergraduate and graduate students experiencing unforeseen difficulties and who are disparately impacted during this time. Our fundraising efforts will continue as we continue our work to meet Kathy’s challenge.

Through our Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, we have awarded undergraduate and graduate students $547,000 in Financial Aid and Scholarships and emergency funding since the crisis began, as well as an additional $120,000 in emergency grants for graduate students from the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant.

Basic Needs Fund

Our community has also come together to support our Bear Pantry and Diaper Bank, located in our student family housing facilities, with $80,000 in donations from the Graduate Assembly and $5,000 from the philanthropic Section Club. Additionally, the campus has supported the Bear Pantry and Diaper Bank with $10,000 as well as food donations. Finally, the Offices of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and the Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion led an effort with Cabinet colleagues in repurposing a total of $63,750 to the Basic Needs Fund, recognizing that staff are among those disparately impacted and suffering multiple challenges right now.

Support for International Students

While not eligible for significant federal and state aid, we know that our international students are nonetheless going through a very challenging period. These students are vital to the vibrancy of our community, and the Berkeley International Office is currently reviewing over 200 applications from international students for emergency student aid. The office will aim to distribute campus funds to international students in the next several weeks.

Support for Graduate Students

Through our Graduate Division, we increased summer funding for graduate students by $600,000. This block grant funding was given to departments to allocate to students. Additionally, the Graduate Division allocated an additional $200,000 in funding to support COVID-19-related basic needs relief, including for graduate student parents. They also increased the number of subsidized back-up care hours that student parents can use for the rest of the school year.

Technology Assistance

The Student Technology Fund (STF) created an emergency response Technology Access Program that, with the support of $280,000 in students’ Student Technology Fees, enabled it to distribute 470 laptops and 200 mobile Wi-Fi hotspots with paid unlimited data plans for six months. STF is funding this program’s expansion in the 2020-21 academic year with an additional $490,000, and has granted $100,000 to Moffitt Library’s electronic lending program, and $228,000 to secure ZoomPro accounts and ZoomPro IT support for all students. STF and others have also supported the launch of the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund portal.

Federal CARES Act Funding for Students

Finally, as mentioned in previous messages, the campus secured $15.2 million in direct-to-student aid through the CARES Act (the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security federal relief bill). These cash grants will help undergraduate and graduate students pay for course materials, technology, food, housing, healthcare and child care expenses they incur as a result of social distancing and remote instruction. The campus has awarded $9.6 million of the $11.2 million set aside for eligible undergraduates. The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, the Graduate Division, and the Graduate Assembly are working closely on awarding CARES Act funding to graduate students and anticipate that $4 million in awards will be distributed to graduate students beginning at the end of May.  Although undocumented students are not eligible to receive CARES Act funding, UC Berkeley is committed to providing equivalent awards to undocumented students who qualify for in-state tuition under AB540. We have awarded over $327,000 in CARES-equivalent funding to undergraduates who filed a California Dream Act Application.

Commitment to our Community

As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout, UC Berkeley leadership remains committed to supporting the members of our community in any way we can. We are thrilled by the ways in which our alumni and donors have heeded this call, too, and thank them for their generosity. We look forward to working with all of our students, staff and faculty to better understand your needs, support you through this challenging period, and ultimately emerge stronger on the other side.",863,cal,5
Berkeley,12-May-2020,"There are two major budget concerns Chancellor Carol Christ has for UC Berkeley. One, the short-term loss of revenue caused by empty residence halls, canceled performance events and empty athletic fields.

Two, is the anticipated steep, long-term cut in state support as California, and the world, grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both, Christ said in a live online Campus Conversation on Monday, contribute to a Berkeley budget deficit between $170 and $400 million. The conversation was a chance for Christ to take virtual questions from the campus community, including students, staff and faculty.

Christ, who joined via webcam from her California Hall office, said that she and other campus leaders were working to understand the total budget impact for the campus before making any decisions.

Campus leaders, she said, are guided by three principles, including protecting the health of Berkeleyans, maintaining educational consistency and “saving as many jobs as possible.”

The short-term loss in revenue due to shelter-in-place is best described as a “steep-V,” Christ said, with revenue that will likely start up again as soon as athletics events start, residence halls fill with students or performances resume.

More troublesome are the potential cuts to the state budget, which are predicted to be as much as $53.4 billion over the next two years.

“It is not conceivable for the state to experience that kind of shortfall and for the University of California to not be affected,” Christ said. “That is something we are obviously very, very concerned about.”

Christ added that she and other Berkeley leaders are monitoring the number of students who plan to enroll in the fall, which will have additional impacts on Berkeley’s budget.

Christ also pointed to three scenarios campus leaders are using to prepare for the next few months.

Above all, Christ said she had been pleased by how the campus community has responded to the COVID-19 crisis.

“I have been so impressed by the resiliency and creativity and dedication of the community, particularly at a time when are all facing challenges, not just in our work lives but in our personal lives,” she said.

Berkeley,6-May-2020,"We are writing today to provide an update on our ongoing planning for fall semester operations. The planning process is wide-ranging and is deepening every day as we bring more faculty and staff onto the committees (described below) that are helping us envision what the fall term could look like. We aim to make key decisions in regard to fall operations by mid-June.

Guiding Principle
A single principle guides all of this work: to protect the health of our community. There are additional sets of principles that guide our plans for instruction and research. We are committed to upholding Berkeley’s excellence across all of our mission areas.

Scenario Planning
Because we don’t know what the spread of COVID-19 will look like over the course of the next few months, each committee below has been asked to develop plans for each of the following three scenarios for the fall semester:

Scenario #1: For public health reasons, the campus must continue with full remote instruction, and predominantly remote work being done in the operations and research realms.
Scenario #2: In-person operations resume, with limits and restrictions imposed by public health authorities.
Scenario #3: Campus operations largely return to normal (i.e., mostly in-person), but wherever possible, will accommodate students, staff, researchers and instructors who need or prefer to operate remotely due to continuing pandemic conditions.
Committees
Each of the following committees has been charged with studying and making suggestions for a key area of campus operations. Each committee will be led by members of the Chancellor’s Cabinet and special advisors who will share their committees’ progress and recommendations during weekly Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet will use the recommendations to guide decision-making as we develop plans to resume operations in a way that maximizes community safety. In addition, we will look for opportunities to incorporate the broad range of student perspectives.

The current committees are:

COVID-19 Public Health and Testing Advisory Committee. Led by Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public Health.
Research. Led by Vice Chancellor for Research Randy Katz.
Instruction. Led by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos.
Student Engagement and Services. Co-led by Vice Provost for Graduate Studies Lisa Garcia Bedolla, Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Oscar Dubón, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Cathy Koshland, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
Housing and Dining. Led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
Operations. Led by Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher. There are three subcommittees within the Operations working group: Workforce, led by Vice Provost for the Faculty Benjamin Hermalin and Chief People and Culture Officer Eugene Whitlock; Events and External Relations; and Information Technology, led by Jenn Stringer.
Athletics. Led by Director of Athletics James Knowlton.
Financial Planning. Led by Vice Chancellor for Finance Rosemarie Rae.
Communications. Led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Diana Harvey.
Again, all of this planning is being done with public health guidelines as our backdrop. We will proceed only with the guidance and express approval of local public health authorities.

We will continue to provide regular status reports about this critical planning process on the campus COVID-19 website, under the Return to Campus tab. In addition, our next Campus Conversations event on Monday, May 11 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we invite you to submit questions about the plans and structures we have established here. We’ll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday’s webcast.

Thank you for everything you are doing to support the university’s mission and serve our students. It is indeed a challenging and uncertain time, and we have been so grateful for your commitment, as well as your patience and flexibility. What makes Berkeley Berkeley is not just our physical campus, or our history, or our traditions … above all else, it is our community. No matter what our fall semester looks like, we will remain strong because of the dedicated service of so many of you.",659,cal,5
Berkeley,6-May-2020,"We understand that many faculty, staff, and students have questions regarding University-related travel, particularly in view of the COVID-19 situation during summer and fall 2020. We also acknowledge the desire to make international travel plans in the near future and the significant difficulty imposed by this uncertain period. This message includes the most updated information available pertaining to the campus’ travel protocol, travel insurance, travel reimbursement, and international agreements.

UCOP Directives and Campus Travel Protocol 
According to the directives issued by UCOP, all UC community members should temporarily avoid non-essential travel to countries with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice and greater. In addition to the UCOP directive, and local to the UC Berkeley campus, University travel to U.S. State Department ‘Do Not Travel’ level 4 locations requires a two-step approval process, first at the decanal level and then from the Vice Provost for Academic Planning. For details related to how essential travel is defined, and to learn about the approval process, please refer to the Global Engagement Office.

Travel Insurance 
As a reminder, faculty, students, and staff who do not book their travel using Connexxus are encouraged to register all travel whether funded by UC Berkeley or another entity. Travel booked through Connexxus is automatically registered with the UC Travel Insurance program. Registering has many benefits, including travel advisories for the locations that you travel to/through, and the ability for the UC to rapidly assist you in case of emerging incidents, medical emergencies, etc. For those intending to travel using UC Berkeley resources or for campus-approved research or educational purposes, please review the campus’ travel protocol and seek essential travel approval beforehand.

Please keep in mind that travel insurance does not cover foreseeable risk; therefore, any travel to areas with a U.S. State Department ‘Do Not Travel’ level 4 advisory will invalidate travel insurance benefits. UC personnel traveling to regions against this advisory do so potentially at their own physical and financial risk. For more information about travel insurance, please visit Risk Services.

Travel Reimbursement
If your business travel has been canceled as a result of COVID-19 and you were not able to obtain a full refund of some or all of your expenses, you have options for requesting reimbursement, which can vary depending on how you booked your travel. These options are outlined on the travel website as well as on a recorded webinar from April 21st provided by UC Berkeley Travel. A wide range of issues associated with travel impacted by COVID-19 are addressed, including an extended question and answer session.

International Contracts
International agreements committing members of the UC community to travel, or foreign cohorts to visit campus, should include terms that allow for no penalty cancellation of in-person deliverables. Depending on the specific language, force majeure clauses may not cover epidemics (e.g. COVID-19), especially where the cancellation or non-performance due to the incident was foreseeable or predictable at the time of contract execution. Senior administration is coordinating with Business Contracts and Brand Protection (BCBP) and Risk Services to revise the language in international agreements to allow for remote alternatives in lieu of in- or outbound travel, or cancellation without penalty.

For further questions or concerns related to any topic in this message, please contact geo@berkeley.edu.

We thank you for your resilience amidst this crisis. We are committed to providing our entire campus community with the best experience possible. As such, we will continue to inform you of the latest developments regarding travel and COVID-19’s impact on international activity.",584,cal,5
Berkeley,4-May-2020,"Tomorrow is #GivingTuesdayNow, a new global day of giving in response to the unprecedented needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As you know, many of our students are facing significant financial challenges: almost overnight, part-time jobs that many relied on to fund their education dried up, while layoffs and pay reductions began weakening the capacity of families to provide a foundation of support. For many UC Berkeley students, the disruptions in learning, housing and access to basic necessities were felt immediately and keenly, as described in this story, “The Student Emergency Fund: A Bridge to a Brighter Future.”

In addition, members of our staff are facing similar financial challenges. On top of the financial challenges are the very real health threats presented by COVID-19, which directly affect members of our community and their families.

The campus has responded by raising support for the Student Emergency Fund, which provides financial assistance to students. In response, our supporters have been incredibly generous – more than 800 of them have given to the fund. Many of you have asked us how you can help UC Berkeley students during these challenging times. If you have the means and the desire, please consider donating to the fund.

A generous UC Berkeley alumna has committed $1 million for student emergency needs. She has challenged us to build upon her generosity by also making a gift. We’re aiming to raise $1 million for the Student Emergency Fund to meet that challenge. Funds will be used to provide emergency grants to students needing assistance with food and rent, technology required for the shift to remote learning, and relocation costs.

Staff members are eligible for assistance through the Basic Needs Relief Fund. This fund is also to those students for whom some of the traditional financial aid sources are not available (e.g., graduate students, international students, undocumented students).

Thank you for your continued commitment to UC Berkeley. Thank you for your grace in adjusting your professional lives to meet the needs of our campus community while we deal with this pandemic. And finally, thank you for considering this request to support our neediest students and staff members.

We extend our best wishes for your health and wellness during these difficult times.",372,cal,5
Berkeley,29-Apr-2020,"The Bay Area’s shelter-in-place order has been officially extended through May with only limited easing of restrictions, including construction and certain outdoor activities.

For the UC Berkeley campus, this means our largely remote operations will continue through May, and some construction projects will likely resume. We will be reviewing the new order over the next few days to determine whether there will be any additional changes to current operations.

The City of Berkeley health officer, along with those from six Bay Area Counties, released the details of the new order today. It goes into effect May 4 and will replace the current shelter-in-place order that expires May 3. 

In accordance with the extended shelter in place timeline, the campus will be cancelling campus events that were scheduled to take place May 4 – May 31.

In issuing the new order, the public health officials noted that it is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activities while also preventing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the counties. The new order allows for certain outdoor activities and businesses including landscaping/gardening businesses, summer camps for limited numbers of children with parents in specific workforces, etc.

I want to thank you for continuing to do your part to protect our community and to keep yourself safe. Please continue to visit the campus’s COVID-19 website for the latest informatIon and updates.",230,cal,4
Berkeley,23-Apr-2020,"In response to concerns about proctoring of examinations under shelter-in-place orders and academic misconduct, the Provost convened a working group at the beginning of April. The 21 members of the working group, consisting of faculty and staff from a wide range of disciplines, were charged with examining strategies for remote exams, developing principles for procuring remote proctoring services, and assessing products for our campus.

The working group completed their report on Monday: Guidance and Recommendations for Instructors and Students on Proctoring and Final Examinations. These guidelines and recommendations are posted on the Academic Senate website as well as the Instructional Resilience website. The report complements the existing guidance on Best Practices for Remote Exams.

We strongly encourage instructors and students to read the report, and hope that these guidelines and recommendations will help you prepare for a successful final examination period and the end of the academic year.

Our thanks to the members of the working group for the thoughtful and diligent work that they performed on a very tight schedule. Their efforts are another example of the many that we have witnessed in the past few months of the community coming together to help our campus. We wish you every success in the coming weeks and hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well.",218,cal,4
Berkeley,23-Apr-2020,"We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 semester. We wish to share information with you as proactively as possible while we carefully observe the progress of the current pandemic.



Like universities around the world, we are working towards making critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation. We have an FAQ website that we will update as more details are announced.

In-person vs. remote instruction decisions
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we don’t have an estimated date. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instructio n. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.

Given the uncertainty the world faces, some students may not be able to safely travel to campus. We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as an option for Fall 2020, even if classes are held in-person.

We’re making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe publ ic health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing. Decisions about broadly offering Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation may be like in the fall.

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising.

Some campus-based fees were established to support certain efforts like the Wellness Fee which is paying for many essential health services. Others were established to maintain the safety of buildings or other facilities when necessary for the health and safety of students—e.g., to address seismic deficiencies. Even as UC campuses such as ours have curtailed limited aspects of their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.

Student housing for fall 2020
Under normal operations, all new students receive priority for housing. It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will allow for normal operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we cannot guarantee housing priority at this time but we are committed to supporting students if they want to liv e on or near campus.

For returning students, if fall classes are offered via remote instruction, we want to empower you to make the best decision for you and your family. We will keep the residential halls and apartments open as they are the primary residence for many students, unless we are required by public health authorities to close them. To date, we have not received any such closure order. If you do choose to live in University owned or affiliated housing, we will allow students the opportunity to be relieved of the financial obligations of their housing and applicable dining contracts and receive a prorated refund if the campus doesn’t resume in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year or ends in-person instruction for an extended period of time (for example, in-person instruction is cancelled for more than 30 consecutive instructional days).

For off-campus housing, students should pay close attention to the terms o f their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease. This will give you more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Learn more about leases at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/leases.

We thank you for your understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the coming fall.",827,cal,4
Berkeley,21-Apr-2020,"You may recall that the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention recently recommended that everyone wear face coverings when away from home to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Please be aware that this is now mandatory in the City of Berkeley, including our campus.

Late last week the City of Berkeley’s Health Officer issued an order requiring that essential businesses such as the campus require their employees to wear a face covering at work, subject to specific exceptions.  We are now requiring that our faculty and staff who are on campus wear face coverings.

UC Berkeley is providing each employee who works on the campus with a face covering or mask. Unless an employee already has  face coverings or masks or has been directed by their supervisor to use their own department’s supply or another supply of masks, Environment, Health & Safety officials will offer masks from a limited stock of surgical masks readily on hand.  The campus will move to providing cloth face coverings when the cloth face coverings purchased arrive later this month.

The surgical masks will be distributed to essential employees at the Hazardous Materials Facility (HMF), 1 Frank Schlessinger Way (enter from Oxford Street; facility is on the right) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, 4/24, Friday, 4/24, and Monday, 4/27.

Faculty or staff picking up masks will be asked to show a Cal ID. If you are not designated as an essential employee or do not have an urgent need to be on campus, please do not come to campus to get a mask.

Face coverings are required for those who work in shared spaces and those performing work in which they encounter the general public. The face coverings must also be worn in common areas indoors, such as hallways and stairwells.  You are not required to wear a face covering when you are the sole occupant of a room, such as your office.

If you have a medical or disability-related reason why it is not appropriate for you to wear a face covering, contact your supervisor to document your situation and obtain an exemption from the requirement.

Also, please be aware that if you provide service to students or the general public, you are required as part of your employment (and consistent with the requirements of the order) to refuse service to individuals who are not wearing face coverings. Such individuals are also to be denied entry to campus facilities.

Keep in mind that a face covering is not a replacement for vigilant physical distancing.

Continue to maintain at least six feet of distance between you and others.

Wearing a cloth face covering is meant to protect others, not the wearer of the covering. Recent studies have suggested that it’s possible to transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. Wearing a cloth face covering decreases the chances of unknowingly transmitting the virus to others.

Employees who are normally required to wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment as part of their job are still required to do so, and will be provided with the required equipment.

We also want to inform you that UHS is now performing COVID-19 tests for all symptomatic faculty and staff. Employees interested in testing at UHS should:

If mild symptoms: call the UCB Occupational Health COVID hotline 510-332-7192 for assessment and instructions (10am-4pm 7 days/week; messages can be left any time).

If ill: please call your own health care provider first for advice or go directly to the nearest Emergency Room.  You are welcome to call Occupational Health as above for testing if advised by your provider.

UHS is also encouraging those who are awaiting test results and those who already have tested positive for COVID-19 via another testing center to call UHS’s CONFIDENTIAL COVID line at (510) 643-8227 to inform clinical leadership.  Officials there want to offer support and services to help those through their care and recovery, and raise our awareness of the number of positive cases in the campus community. This will help UHS plan its services and guide campus decisions.  Your private information will not be shared beyond that required for public health reporting.

Thank you for continuing to do your part as we all seek to further bend the curve. And thank you for your continued work for the campus community.",723,cal,4

Climate Change and COVID-19: Can this crisis shift the paradigm?

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is skidding into recession. Reduced consumption and transportation also mean reduced CO2 emissions. From India to China to the United States, skies are blue and the air is cleaner and healthier in cities than it has been for years. The pandemic has caused seismic shifts in how we produce and consume goods and could open a path to a more sustainable future. Or, government bailouts and investments could double down on the fossil fuel economy, and set back efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change. This conversation will feature Berkeley researchers discussing the science and policy behind CO2 emissions and opportunities for a different path forward.

This event is sponsored by the Rausser College of Natural Resources.

Dan Kammen is Professor and Chair of the Energy Resources Group, and Professor in the Goldman School of Public Policy and the Department of Nuclear Engineering. He is an expert on energy systems and the science and policy behind climate solutions.

Berkeley,17-Apr-2020,"We wrote to you earlier this month to describe our campus budget picture and the principles we are using to make decisions. Today, we share an update, as well as additional information that we are using to further understand and shape the campus budget for the remainder of this fiscal year, for FY 2021, and beyond.

Before we delve into the details, we want to express our deep appreciation for all that you are doing to preserve our education and research missions, and fulfill our public service mission. We are heartened by the ways so many of you have stepped up to deliver education in a radically different fashion than you are used to; pivoted in creative ways to maintain your research projects, some even venturing into new avenues of research around COVID-19; supported our students in innumerable ways; and served the campus by participating in the new Berkeley Conversations series, holding your own webinars, responding to media inquiries and providing your expertise to our elected officials.

Campus priorities and decision-making principles
As we wrote in our April 1 message, our goals — as far as our budget and community are concerned — are to preserve jobs, and position the campus favorably for the future. Our decisions will continue to be based on public health guidance and our interest in protecting the health and safety of our campus community.

As we move into the budget process, we will prioritize protecting the academic core while also providing resources to departments entrusted with health and life safety. In addition, it has become clear we will need to continue to invest in remote learning, and provide the necessary resources for employees to be able to effectively work remotely.

Uncertainty has become a key feature both in our personal and professional lives and for now, at least, it is a cloud that hangs over our budget process as well. The best way to address this uncertainty in the budget realm is to engage in planning for multiple scenarios, imagining and projecting against a number of possible short- and long-term realities. And it also means that we will be proactive in budget planning and ask for your collaboration, ingenuity and patience as we go through the process.

COVID-19 budget impacts and FY 2021 projection
The impact of COVID-19 on the campus budget is now projected to be in the range of $200 million, representing a combination of revenue losses and expenses, which we described in our April 1 message. Underpinning this projection are a number of factors in flux: We do not yet have a clear picture of what fall enrollment will look like, nor do we know what level of state funding we can expect. Insofar as state funding is concerned, given the state’s delayed tax return deadline of July 15, the state’s budget will not be finalized until August, and thus, we will not know what our funding levels will be until that time.

For this reason, we are adjusting the campus budget schedule and process. We will ask departments and divisions to prepare two separate budgets based on two different scenarios, and then once we have a sense of our fall enrollment and state funding, we will ask you to formally submit one of the two. We believe this process will allow us to be nimble once the external forces are known and also help to set expectations within departments and divisions and across campus around the possibilities we are facing.

Mitigation strategies
There are a number of strategies by which we can mitigate to some extent the impact on our budget from COVID-19. Congress has passed one piece of legislation (known as the CARES Act), which promises to bring $30 million to the Berkeley campus, $15 million of which will go directly to emergency financial assistance for students. Other federal stimulus packages are being considered which may provide funding for COVID-19 research, capital and infrastructure projects. In addition, the campus is actively investigating whether we are eligible for funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis.

Another approach that we will take is to carefully reconsider future capital projects in light of the current uncertainties.

There are strategies being considered at the systemwide level that would provide budget relief, such as a delay in merit increases and salary cuts for senior leadership; authority for those decisions rests in the UC Office of the President and will not be made soon.

Given the importance of fall enrollment to our budget picture, the campus is executing an aggressive approach to admissions, including a week of yield activities kicking off tomorrow with the start of a virtual Cal Week (in place of Cal Day, the well-known campus-wide welcome to our admitted students and community festival).

Having just recently emerged from several years of a budget deficit, we already find ourselves on a frail base, with increased reliance on revenue-generating strategies and philanthropy. After mitigation efforts, FY 2021’s deficit is projected to be in the range of $130-160 million.

The way forward
UC Berkeley’s history has been characterized by a remarkable resilience. It is our fervent hope that this will be the case as we emerge from this current crisis. Please let us continue to work together, to support each other and the most vulnerable among us, and take decisive steps to preserve our mission, which is more important now than ever.

Please take good care of yourselves and those close to you. We will be in touch soon. Please monitor the campus COVID-19 site for continuing updates.",932,cal,4
Berkeley,15-Apr-2020,"Chancellor Carol Christ has three priorities for UC Berkeley while it responds to the COVID-19 pandemic: protect the health of students, faculty and staff; maintain educational vigor and save as many jobs as possible.

Christ and Paul Alivisatos, the executive vice chancellor and provost, spent nearly an hour Wednesday discussing how Berkeley has dealt with one of the most tumultuous months in the 152-year-old institution’s history. The talk was part of Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19, a series of live online videos featuring Berkeley experts analyzing and discussing the worldwide impacts of the new coronavirus.

The two leaders pointed to a number of ways faculty, staff and students have responded to the pandemic and shelter-in-place, including efforts to quickly spin up robotic virus tests, produce hand sanitizer for those in need and find new ways to teach lab classes online.

But many questions remain, including when normal operations will return, what the budget outlook will be and what spring commencement will look like.

“The big questions about our budget are still uncertain at this point,” Christ said, pointing to declining revenue and a promise to avoid layoffs until the end of June. “The (new student) enrollments in the fall will determine what the budget impacts will be.”

Christ and Alivisatos promised to be transparent in their decisions, and follow the guidance of public health authorities. Still, Christ said she didn’t have any doubts about Berkeley’s future.

“The dominant characteristic of Berkeley throughout its history is resilience,” she said.

Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19, are a series of live, online events featuring faculty experts from across the UC Berkeley campus who are sharing what they know, and what they are learning, about the pandemic.

Berkeley,9-Apr-2020,"You’re encouraged to cover your nose and mouth with cloth when leaving home, to further reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus per the city of Berkeley. A bandana, fabric mask, neck gaiter or other cloth barrier helps prevent those who might have COVID-19 but mild or no symptoms from unknowingly spreading it to others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a guide to creating a cloth face covering out of materials you likely have at home.



The CDC and our local public health officer advise against using a surgical mask or N-95 mask unless it is a requirement of your job. Please make an effort to use your own cloth covering until campus is able to procure them. Preserve the limited supply of N-95 and surgical masks for health care workers, first responders and others who cannot use physical distance to protect themselves.

Continue to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between you and others. A face covering is not a replacement for vigilant physical distancing.

Wearing a cloth face covering is meant to protect others, not the wearer of the covering. Recent studies have suggested that it’s possible to transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. Wearing a cloth face covering decreases the chances of unknowingly transmitting the virus to others.

Be compassionate and stop forms of hate. We understand that wearing a mask or facial covering can impact opportunities for interaction and friendly connection between individuals. Please recognize that we are all in this together and are all human beneath our facial coverings. Avoid acts of bias, hostility, stereo-type threat, and/or false assumptions when interacting with individuals wearing facial coverings or masks. We encourage community discourse based on belonging and care for one another as we stand united against all forms of bias.

Please note that UC Berkeley is not currently requiring the use of a cloth face covering for campus employees who are performing an essential service. However, we are attempting to purchase a large quantity for future use. Given national shortages and long lead times, it could be several weeks before sufficient quantities are available.

Employees who are normally required to wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment as part of their job are still required to do so, and will be provided with the required equipment.

Thank you for doing your part to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Coronavirus: Science and Solutions 

Berkeley’s School of Public Health will host a follow-up to its initial town hall, Coronavirus: Facts & Fears, which focused on illuminating the facts and dispelling fears around this public health crisis. Part two of this series, Coronavirus: Science and Solutions, will focus on addressing unanswered questions from the last town hall, and highlighting emerging science that will drive solutions to this and future pandemics.",362,cal,4
Berkeley,3-Apr-2020,"We write today, in recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), to raise awareness of resources available during the COVID-19 crisis to prevent domestic and sexual violence and support survivors. Experiencing violence or harassment is always a complex and painful experience. The current circumstances may be creating unique stressors, due to being in close or constant proximity with an abusive person, lack of access to resources, and/or physical distance from support networks. Compassion and kindness toward others and self-care are needed now more than ever.

First, to survivors: We write today with an unconditional message of support. Please know that despite physical distancing, you are not alone. There are many local and national resources still available for you and ready to assist you every step of the way.

Everyone deserves support and a comprehensive list of resources can be found on the PATH to Care Center’s website. For 24/7 urgent support, call the Care Line at 510-643-2005.

For those in locations with shelter-in-place orders, seeking medical attention or privacy in order to access support resources is an appropriate reason to leave your residence.

Consider creating a network of support that agrees to check in regularly and ways to alert them if abuse or violence occurs or escalates.

If the shelter-in-place location is not physically or psychologically safe, discuss safety plans and identify alternative shelter options with confidential resources. For students in need of an on-campus housing option, contact Cal Housing at reshall@berkeley.edu.

It may be difficult to find privacy for a phone call, consider using the chat-based resources provided by the National Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Hotlines.

Reports can be made to law enforcement (UCPD or local police department) and/or to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD).

We also want to remind everyone that sexual and domestic violence and harassment are never the survivor’s fault or responsibility. Importantly, the stressors associated with COVID-19 are not an excuse and do not justify taking anger out on or harming another person. If you are concerned about your own behaviors, read about resources or call: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)

Lastly, to our campus community:  To help you prevent violence and support the survivors in your life, here are some recommendations during COVID-19:

Affirm healthy norms–virtually or in-person–by practicing respect and kindness, defining and expressing personal boundaries, supporting others by valuing and upholding their personal boundaries, and checking in with your community.

Engage in intervention even during physical distancing. We can intervene on social media, video calls, texts, as well as in person. Check-in calls via video and phone may be ways to buffer against violence at home.

Express support privately if you are concerned about someone experiencing abuse or violence. Check in with them, offer resources, and identify additional opportunities for intervention.

Express support publicly to ensure that all survivors know they are valued and supported and to promote prevention. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center, the sponsor of SAAM, has graphics and videos for social media and ways to get engaged online.

Managers, chairs, and faculty members, we know you are doing your part to make sure that UC Berkeley colleagues and students are and feel supported. We encourage you to send personalized versions of this message to your departmental community.

Finally, we want to send a deep, heartfelt thank you to the campus and community sexual and domestic violence response providers as well as the healthcare providers, first-responders, and essential personnel who are maintaining critical campus functions.",579,cal,4
Berkeley,2-Apr-2020,"Across the UC Berkeley campus, researchers are rising to meet the complex challenges of COVID-19, even as the crisis generates waves of news and information that can be confusing and contradictory at times. In response, the university is launching a new online video series, “Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19,” to connect our experts with the public and each other. Through Q&As, seminars, and panel discussions, faculty from a wide range of disciplines – from epidemiology to economics to the computing and data now undergirding their work – will share what they know, and what they are learning.

We will offer open access to these forums every week through a new website, where it will be possible to watch live and archived conversations and consult a calendar that will list future events as they are scheduled.

The series kicks off tomorrow, Friday, April 3, at 12:30 p.m., with a Q&A focused on how we can make sense of data and information about the virus’s spread, the impact and efficacy of social distancing and the implications for our short- and long-term futures. This first Berkeley Conversation will feature:

Prof. Art. Reingold, M.D., the Division Head of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UC Berkeley School of Public Health. He has more than 40 years of experience in the prevention and control of infectious diseases at the national and global level.
Associate Provost Jennifer Chayes, who leads the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the School of Information. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her research areas include biomedicine applications and epidemiological modeling.
Updated information will be provided to the public and campus community as new events are scheduled. For now, here is a list of events scheduled for the next two weeks:

Tuesday, April 7, from 10 -11:30 a.m. (PST), Nobel Laureate Saul Perlmutter, Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, and Michael Lu, Dean of the Berkeley School of Public Health, will host and moderate a roundtable discussion with Berkeley researchers focusing on how they are mobilizing computing and data science for COVID-19 response and recovery, from helping local public health officials track outbreaks to predicting and addressing impacts on employment and elections. This conversation is titled “Creating Informed Responses: Berkeley’s Computing and Data Science In Action.”
On Friday, April 10, at  a time to be determined, we will focus on the growing financial and economic impacts of the pandemic in this country and around the world. Faculty experts will help the audience understand possible outcomes and scenarios, the likely impact of governmental actions to date and what additional steps may be needed to address an array of extraordinary challenges posed by COVID-19.
On Monday, April 13 from 4:30-6 p.m., UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health will host a follow-up to its initial town hall, “Coronavirus: Facts & Fears.” An archived version of that event can be found here. Part Two of this series, “Coronavirus: Science and Solutions,” will focus on addressing unanswered questions from the last town hall, and highlighting emerging science that will drive solutions to this and future pandemic outbreaks.
Over the course of the next several weeks, Berkeley Conversations will present faculty experts who will address a range of pressing issues, questions and concerns regarding timely research subjects including:

Epidemiological and economic developments as they unfold

Public Policy: Equity and disparities in the age of COVID-19

Child Psychology: Caring for kids in trying times

Berkeley,2-Apr-2020,"Following the announcement on Friday, March 20 for a revised grading policy for the Spring Semester, the campus has been busy coordinating with colleges and schools to adjust requirements to allow students to take advantage of the policy.

The campus has also received queries from students, instructors, and the public about the policy and instructional resilience. Over the past two weeks, faculty and staff have compiled the questions and composed answers to them. The result of this effort can be found in the following resources:

Q&A for Students about Grading

Q&A for Instructors about Grading

Best Practises for Remote Examinations

Guidance on Copyright of Instructional Materials

Best Practices for Using Zoom

Settings for Preventing Zoom-Bombing

The Q&A resources will be updated to include additional questions and answers through the remainder of the semester.

Students and instructors have also had questions about final exams and proctoring. The Administration and the Academic Senate are working on guidance for exams and solutions to proctoring, as well as virtual classroom climate issues. Updates on these topics and other issues related to remote instruction will be posted on the campus Instructional Resilience website.

We are most grateful to the extraordinary efforts we have witnessed over the past month from staff, students, and instructors to help maintain and preserve the instructional missions of our campus. We thank you for your dedication and hard work and hope you are safe and well.",235,cal,4
Berkeley,2-Apr-2020,"This week, the city of Berkeley joined together with six other Bay Area jurisdictions to extend the shelter-in-place order through May 3. In conjunction with this extension, additional restrictions have been put in place to further reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The challenge has been, and continues to be, that asymptomatic people can feel completely fine while unknowingly endangering others. Sheltering in place has proven to be the most effective method of slowing the spread of this virus.

UC Berkeley’s early action on sheltering in place appears to have been prudent. It’s important that we remain vigilant in our efforts and take additional measures to safeguard all of us in the UC Berkeley community. Below please find a list of updated administrative guidelines to manage the extended shelter-in-place order and to assist you in working remotely effectively.

Access to campus buildings
All campus buildings will be locked beginning on Friday, April 3 at 5 p.m. Card key access will no longer work after that time for non-essential employees. Employees requesting designation as an essential employee will require their supervisor and vice chancellor approval.Employees needing emergency access to buildings should contact the UC Police Department.

Announcing building closure may tempt some individuals to beat the deadline in an attempt to  access work material or personal items. We strongly urge you to not come to campus. Provisions have been made for individuals who need ergonomic tools and peripherals from their office; please see details below.

Outdoor recreational facilities closed
Effective immediately, all outdoor recreational facilities at UC Berkeley are closed until further notice. This includes tennis courts, basketball courts, play structures, tracks, fields, and other areas. Please cooperate and stay away from these facilities to discourage the spread of COVID-19.

Temporary work-from-home agreement
If supervisors have not yet done so, they should share and request completion of  the Temporary Work from Home Agreement with each employee who is working remotely.

Employees temporarily working outside of California
Department managers or HR personnel of staff and student employees who temporarily relocated out-of-state are asked to complete and submit this form. For now, these employees will continue to be paid without adjusting their current California payroll withholding.

If the shelter-in-place order is rescinded in the near future, a reconciliation for tax purposes may be needed to adjust an individual’s tax withholding to align with their work location of temporary residence. If the shelter-in-place order is extended even further, employee records may need to be adjusted in UCPath to reflect the tax withholding of the location in which employees are working.

International Employees
Employees on a non-immigrant status choosing/or having chosen to temporarily relocate to an address that is not within the normal commuting distance to the worksite and/or outside the country should also inform the Berkeley International Office as soon as possible of their new address.

Ergonomic tips and resources for remote work
The proper ergonomics design of your computer workstation is important if you are working on campus or at home. University Health Services has ergonomics information, resources and limited matching funds to help you set up your remote workstation, including alist of pre-approved ergonomic products,instructions for purchasing and home delivery.

Additional tips for working remotely
The Office of People & Culture (formerly central Human Resources) has compiled a web resource with a curated list of tips and resources for working remotely. 

COVID-19 updates
The UC Berkeley coronavirus site continues to be updated regularly. Please check the site regularly for the latest information on this evolving situation and for an archive of past messages.

We understand that sheltering in place and working remotely is challenging but this is being cited as the most effective action we can take to combat the pandemic. Early action has proven effective; continued action will be key. Please accept my heartfelt appreciation for your individual actions in helping the university navigate this challenge. I am confident that we will get through this difficult period and emerge stronger from it",660,cal,4
Berkeley,2-Apr-2020,"Earlier today UC President Janet Napolitano, my fellow chancellors and I issued this message indicating that there will be no COVID-19-related layoffs of career employees through June 30, 2020 within the UC system. (Annual summer furloughs that are routinely implemented in areas such as housing and dining are not included as part of this guidance).

The Office of the President is preparing a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document to give guidance and additional details and we will share it soon with managers and supervisors and other campus leaders.

I am pleased to join fellow UC leaders in issuing this guidance as a demonstration of how much we value our employees and in recognition of the unprecedented time in which we find ourselves.

Thank you for all you do. Be well.",130,cal,4
Berkeley,2-Apr-2020,"We are writing to follow up on yesterday’s message regarding a campus-wide hiring freeze. What follows is our effort to answer some of the questions that we have received about academic and staff hiring during this period.

Ongoing faculty searches will be reviewed and approved under a process overseen by the Vice Provost for the Faculty; a communication is being sent to Deans and Chairs that will provide details.

For all other titles, requests for an exception to the hiring freeze should be sent through the Dean, Vice Chancellor, Vice/Associate Provost, or Associate Chancellor for the area, and will be reviewed by the Finance Committee, which consists of the Chancellor, the Provost, the Vice Chancellor for Finance, and Vice Chancellor for Administration.

We have prepared a brief FAQ that provides additional guidance about the Hiring Freeze. Further information about the exception request process will be shared with the Cabinet and Council of Deans in the coming days. We will be asking that all requests for exceptions include a brief justification for why the hire should continue. Currently running searches will receive high priority and are likely to be viewed positively if the searches are at the interview stage. Decisions on exemption requests for current searches will be made within a week of receipt by the Finance Committee.",217,cal,4
Berkeley,1-Apr-2020,"We are writing today to share the latest information regarding the campus budget, our principles for decision making, and our initial recommendations.

The budget challenges we face related to the COVID-19 pandemic are becoming increasingly apparent. The Regents, recognizing the magnitude of the public health crisis, have set aside what was an advanced plan for a cohort tuition increase. Similarly, the governor must cope with unprecedented new challenges; hence, he has told us to expect, at best, a flat budget from the state. Anticipated Summer Session and University Extension revenues are down; additionally, we face an uncertain enrollment picture for the fall, particularly in regard to out-of-state and international students. We also face immediate losses in revenue and anticipated revenue—from cancellation of housing and dining contracts, as well as the cessation of all public gatherings such as those of Cal Performances and intercollegiate athletics. In addition, some of our expenses (technology upgrades to support online teaching and remote working, for example) have increased sharply.

The longer that normal operations are disrupted, the more dire the situation becomes. Current estimates place the budget impact of all of this in excess of $100 million and growing.

Campus Priorities
From the beginning of this emergency, the campus has put its teaching and research missions and protecting the health and safety of our community at the fore. We also continue to actively address the concerns and interests of our students and their families.

Now we turn to you asking that we seek ways to pull together so that we can save jobs, with the same spirit of cooperation and ingenuity that we have used thus far in facing the pandemic.

We are considering a number of proactive, budget-conserving actions to protect jobs. We can implement some measures on our own as a campus; in other areas we must wait for guidance from the UC Office of the President as the decisions have system-wide implications. We will be writing in the coming days in more detail about steps we can take to address these challenges. In addition, we will consult with our faculty and staff experts to inform and assist us in making decisions that are the best possible socially and economically for our employees.

Campus-wide hiring freeze
Today we are instituting a campus-wide hiring freeze. We therefore ask that you do not initiate any new searches and suspend those that have already begun. The Office of People and Culture (formerly central human resources) is completing work on a hiring-freeze plan which will be shared with managers and supervisors shortly. The campus will be making very limited exceptions to the hiring freeze, making only select hires that protect against a significant business disruption and/or a significant health, safety, or ethical compliance risk. All academic hiring requests will be carefully reviewed by the Provost’s office.

We also ask that you carefully monitor expenses as we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year and hold off on any major expenditures until our budget picture becomes clearer. Please consult with your manager/supervisor or department/division head for guidance.

On a related note, our campus has been at the forefront of advocating for state and federal assistance and we will continue to push for these avenues of support, some of which will directly benefit our students.

We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this important financial modeling and analysis.

Concern for your well-being
We acknowledge that this is an incredibly stressful and trying time for everyone: those working to balance work and family, those facing health challenges and worried about the health of loved ones, those with financial hardship, and those for whom the uncertainty of our current reality is overwhelming. We are working in numerous ways to alleviate some of these burdens and invite you to make use of campus resources if needed. Please refer to the campus COVID-19 website for all other information; it is being continuously updated and has a form to submit questions.

Meantime, take good care and we will continue to share information as decisions are made.",677,cal,4
Berkeley,31-Mar-2020,"Sitting in front of their computers in homes and offices across the Bay Area, six of UC Berkeley’s top administrators joined a shared video conference call last week to update the campus community on how the school is responding to the coronavirus pandemic.

The group, which included leaders like Chancellor Carol Christ and Steven Sutton, vice chancellor of student affairs, spoke and took questions for 50 minutes.

Topics included how researchers are responding to the shelter-in-place order, how students can cope and how staff should stay connected to their work and colleagues while working from home.

Berkeley,27-Mar-2020,"Tomorrow is Cesar Chavez Day, a holiday honoring the principles of fairness, social justice, and the struggle for equity in the workplace and all of society. As we continue to adjust to our new reality created by COVID-19, both with respect to work and our personal lives, it is more important than ever to pause and think about the broader values and personal meaning that this day represents. Managers should encourage all employees (unless required to perform emergency services) to take the time to rest, reflect and renew. We offer special recognition to those who continue to maintain our critical campus operations during this crisis and who support the most vulnerable members of our community.

These are uncertain times. As the news and guidance around COVID-19 change and intensify, it is normal to feel overwhelmed and experience stress and anxiety. The current circumstances are particularly difficult for those who do not have necessary resources, or for whom home or the location of shelter is not physically or psychologically safe.

Please know that despite social distance, you are not alone. Campus resources are still available for you, including those listed at the end of this message. We also invite you to compassionately support others, as you are able. Everyone deserves support.

We are so grateful for how Berkeley staff and faculty are finding time to come together with their colleagues in healthy and creative ways during this crisis. We encourage you to read this Berkeley News article about how some of our community members are connecting via virtual happy hours, online art classes, livestreamed yoga sessions, and more. The central campus is looking into other methods of bringing us together while we’re physically apart, and is collecting suggestions for how to make the best of our current situation. We encourage you to view and take part in these efforts.

With best wishes for your well-being on Cesar Chavez Day, and all those to follow.

As the world adapts to these extraordinary times so, too, is UC Berkeley. Even as we continue to make every effort to keep the campus community informed, the pace of change has been profound, and new issues and uncertainties seem to arise with every passing day. In order to answer salient questions coming in from students, staff, faculty, parents, and alumni, we have assembled a panel of senior campus leaders:

Berkeley,23-Mar-2020,"Many of you have reached out to inquire about our plans for commencement this May. Your communications with my office have been thoughtful, kind, and compassionate, and for that I am deeply grateful. We find ourselves in uncharted waters in having to make a decision about something as special as commencement. We all love commencement, and you all are certainly so very deserving of a meaningful celebration that honors all of your hard work and accomplishments at Berkeley.

Visit Berkeley’s coronavirus information page

I am writing today to let you know that due to the continuing public health threat posed by COVID-19, we have decided to postpone the May 16 all-campus commencement. This was a difficult decision, but we heard so many of you when you asked for a decision so that you can move forward with your own plans. In the coming days, you will also be hearing from your school, college, and affinity groups regarding plans for those specific graduation ceremonies.

This is a postponement, and as a next step, we would like your advice on how and when we mark this milestone in your lives. Your achievements certainly warrant a celebration, and we hope that you will ring in with your thoughts. We could set a date later in the summer in the hope that conditions improve sufficiently. We could invite you to participate in the December 2020 or the May 2021 ceremonies, or we could hold a virtual celebration on the original May 16, 2020 date. We want to hear from you. Please consider participating in this survey to help us find a new path forward.

You are the lifeblood of this campus and we share your sadness and frustration that we won’t be able to proceed with our traditional May commencement.

Berkeley,20-Mar-2020,"As we head into spring break, I would like to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to each and every one of you for helping our campus navigate the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the course of just a few weeks, the rapid spread of the virus into the Bay Area has turned a relatively normal Berkeley semester upside down. To slow the rate of infection and keep our community safe, we canceled in-person gatherings and asked instructors to move hundreds of classes out of lecture halls and onto the internet. Researchers were directed away from their labs and encouraged to think creatively about what work they could do from home. Staff took on new responsibilities as they shepherded our campus through a period of incredible change. And students endeavored to keep up their studies, undeterred by new class formats and without the support of nearby friends and mentors.

These transitions would have been monumental on their own, but their effects have been compounded by the upheavals taking place throughout society. Many of us are now playing the role of full-time teacher to our children or grandchildren, unexpectedly sharing homes with our parents, turning kitchen tables into office or study spaces, and adapting to other transformations in our ways of life. The effects of the outbreak are uneven, too, exposing disparities based on age, wealth, living situation, access to childcare, access to food, and more. Beneath daily disruptions lie greater worries about the virus itself, and the lasting effects this pandemic may have on our world.

Given the context, the efforts you are making to keep our community safe and our academic enterprise moving forward are nothing short of heroic. I want to thank you, on behalf of our whole campus and from the bottom of my heart.

“
We are in the midst of a disruption unlike any in recent memory, but I am so proud and grateful to see such a spirit of community emerge even in spite of that.

– Carol Christ

In a 2009 book, Berkeley alum and author Rebecca Solnit set out to uncover how local communities responded when faced with catastrophic events like the 1985 Mexico City earthquake or 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. She found that out of chaos and grief there often emerged, paradoxically, a profound spirit of generosity, connection, and collective purpose. During dark times, she wrote, we tend to become more supportive of those around us, more understanding, more giving and forgiving, and more in touch with our common humanity.

This phenomenon is now taking shape right in front of our eyes. I see it when our staff bring cookies from canceled events to workers providing essential services to the campus. I see it in the way our teaching listservs buzz with instructors sharing tips on improving digital pedagogy. I see it in the relentlessness of our biomedical researchers, who are working nonstop to develop diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19. I see it in the huge outpouring of support we’ve received from alumni to our student emergency fund. I see it in the fact that campus offices are coming together for digital happy hours at the close of a long work day. I see it in the creative ways our students are using technology to keep in touch, building strong bonds even in a time of turmoil.

We are in the midst of a disruption unlike any in recent memory, but I am so proud and grateful to see such a spirit of community emerge even in spite of that. Though our friends and colleagues may appear only on a screen, and though our memories of a lively campus – the bustle of Memorial Glade on a sunny afternoon, the coziness of the Morrison Reading Room on a dark evening – feel far away, we are nevertheless keeping our sense of Berkeley alive through these many acts of love, generosity, and connection-building.

I am certain that our old way of life will come back, and promise to keep you informed as we learn more about how and when this will occur. For now, please be vigilant about protecting your health and the health of others. Work hard and study hard. This too shall pass, and when it does, we will return to Berkeley and each other with an even greater appreciation of what our wonderful community represents.

Thank you for everything you do for our institution.",740,cal,3
Berkeley,20-Mar-2020,"The campus has faced tremendous challenges in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decisions and actions have been taken at an extraordinary pace and the response from our community has been inspirational. Guiding the decision making has been the principle of prioritizing the health and well-being of the community. In addition, every effort has been made to preserve the instructional and research missions of our university.

In response to the unusual and challenging circumstances that instructors and students are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we write to let you know that the Academic Senate has approved the following changes for the spring 2020 semester:

The default grading basis for all undergraduate courses for the spring 2020 semester will be changed to Passed/Not Passed (P/NP).

Instructors must continue to maintain and submit records of letter grades earned.

Students will be permitted to change their grading option to letter grade until at least May 6, 2020 (the Wednesday of RRR week).

The policy does not apply to courses that can only be taken P/NP. The exact deadline during RRR week for changing grading options will be announced at a later date.

Further, the Divisional Council (DIVCO) and Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI), on behalf of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, have authorized the temporary suspension of some regulations. This has enabled schools and colleges to temporarily modify requirements for students affected by the COVID-19 emergency and ensure that progress toward a degree or a minor will not be affected should a student take a class P/NP. A notation will be included on transcripts indicating the exceptional change to grading during spring 2020.

Graduate students may change the grading of their courses to Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) until Friday, May 8, 2020. As part of the relaxation of regulations approved, graduate programs may increase the fraction of S/U courses that can count toward degree requirements beyond the existing cap of 1/3. We remind instructors that they must continue to maintain and submit records of letter grades earned.

Advice and additional details on implementation of these policies to students will be forthcoming by the end of next week and we ask students for their patience. Rest assured your health and well-being is our primary concern. Companion messaging and guidance on the policy will be sent to instructors, staff, and student advisors; we are very grateful to them for the additional effort that will be required to implement the policy.

We thank all of you for your efforts to maintain the mission of our campus. The sacrifices you are making now will save lives and help to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. This time will pass and will become a chapter in our campus’s history that we can all be proud of. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and your loved ones.",473,cal,3
Berkeley,20-Mar-2020,"We are writing with updates related to COVID-19. First, a message of thanks for all you are doing to adapt to our new reality of remotely delivered instruction, social distancing, and sheltering in place. It has been a radical and abrupt change in all aspects of our lives and we appreciate your patience as we work to protect the health of the members of our campus community while trying to preserve our mission.

You all are likely aware that Governor Newsom issued a statewide executive order yesterday. The Governor’s order complements the Bay Area orders, so it doesn’t reflect a change for our campus and the directives that have been issued about coming to work.

Cases of COVID-19 associated with the campus
We reported on our first case last Saturday, March 14 in this message.

Health experts advise that COVID-19 has been circulating widely in the Bay Area for some time and it is highly likely that many of us have come into contact with an infected individual. As you probably know, testing is not widely available in the Bay Area. The virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were widely available, testing would reveal that many of us have already been exposed to this virus.

The primary public health strategy now is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. Local public health authorities are no longer tracing contacts between people who test positive and others except in exceptional circumstances.

We are giving students in our residence halls more information to assist them in making choices to leave campus housing if they are able. We are committed to remaining operational for those who need or wish to remain housed on campus. We will continue to  alter our dining hall operations to mitigate the spread of the virus. We have provided detailed information and instructions to students with housing and dining contracts.

Travel
The U.S. Department of State has issued a Global Level 4/Do Not Travel advisory this afternoon.

If your university-related travel has been affected by COVID-19, please visit the Berkeley Travel Office website for information about reimbursement.

Additionally, for business travelers who booked their travel through Connexxus and are currently traveling and,

Please consult the emergency assistance page of the UC Berkeley Travel site.

Events
Campus units have cancelled events and event reservations through April 7. The current policy regarding campus events and updates as they become available will be posted on the Berkeley News COVID-19 information website. We have not yet made a decision about spring commencement activities.

Parking
While we have been clear about having everyone stay away from campus, we recognize there are very limited situations where someone will need to be on campus. For that reason, we have suspended parking restrictions and will not be issuing tickets. The only exceptions are that you are not permitted to park in fire lanes or reserved spaces, or disabled spaces without a placard, and there is still no parking between 2am and 5am. For more information about parking and transportation during this time, please visit the parking website.

Well-being
We  recognize that many people are experiencing heightened anxiety and fear in response to the current pandemic and the uncertainty it brings. While we all strive to support each other as a community, at times, it may also be useful to connect with formal resources for assistance.

You can access free, confidential support from a licensed mental health professional through Be Well at Work – Employee Assistance. Appointments, including phone and video options are available, and can be scheduled:

Principles of Community
We have been made aware of xenophobic acts on our campus and want everyone to know in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is wrong, goes against our values and violates our Principles of Community. If you experience this or any other form of race- or ethnicity-based targeting, please report it at our Stop Hate website. Now is the time to be practicing compassion and kindness, recognizing that each of us is operating in a state of uncertainty.

Berkeley,19-Mar-2020,"We understand that many students are still considering whether they want to remain in campus-operated student housing for the remainder of the semester. We are writing to provide you with updated information about what we anticipate the conditions in our resident housing may be, based upon the most current public health information available to the campus.

We are committed to supporting all of our students through this outbreak, especially those who remain in campus residence halls and apartments. This information is concerning, but we want you to know the latest information, so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. We fully appreciate that for many of you, leaving campus housing is not an option.  For those of you who do have the option to move, you can find information about relief from the financial obligations of your housing agreements on the Housing Move Out/COVID-19 webpage. You can also find the form needed to be relieved from your financial obligations under your housing agreement here. Yesterday, the head of the UC Health System advised students who are able to make the choice to move out of the residence halls should do so in order to enable social distancing protocols for those who need to remain.

We have confirmed with the City of Berkeley Public Health Department that it is not a violation of the shelter-in-place order to move out of campus housing.

Exposure to COVID-19

We do not anticipate that every campus environment can be managed to avoid exposing people to COVID-19, given what public health authorities have told the public about the existing conditions of widespread community transmission of the virus in the Bay Area. As you probably know, testing is not widely available in the Bay Area. The virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were available, testing would reveal that many of us have already been exposed to this virus. That includes the people who live near you, the residential staff that support your residential experience, and the dedicated people who prepare and serve your meals and clean your facilities.

The primary public health strategy is now mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals.  Local public health authorities are no longer tracing contacts between people who test positive and others except in exceptional circumstances. We want to prepare you for the reality that the dense living conditions of campus housing make it inevitable that you will be told that that people living in and supporting campus housing have tested positive.

It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residence halls or apartments. We have a limited ability to house these students off campus, but we anticipate that those off-campus resources will be exhausted quickly as more people become ill. Inevitably, students who are ill will be living in some proximity to students who are well. We will, of course, provide as much physical distance as we can between students who are ill and those who are not ill, and implement other measures to avoid exposure to people who are ill, as much as we are able.

The campus is attempting to move as quickly as possible to provide boxed and to-go meals, instead of serving food in dining halls. You should expect that in the future, residents may not be permitted to sit and eat together. While taking your meal to go is currently available, switching to boxed meals only will be a challenging goal to achieve. Reconfiguring our dining operation in this manner is not simple. We are concerned that as staff become ill, we will not have enough people to support the labor-intensive effort necessary to prepare individual meals. Everyone on the globe is attempting to buy the supplies necessary to provide meals to go, at a time when production of those materials has been slowed by the impacts of the virus.

It may therefore be necessary, in order for us to provide for appropriate social distancing, for us to assign you to a staggered meal time, or require you to eat in your room, or outdoors, or otherwise manage your dining experience in a manner that is not convenient for you. We will be flexible if your assigned meal time conflicts with a time you need to be online for a class.

Housing assignments

Depending upon how many people move out of campus housing, and how many people become ill, it is possible that you will be required to move to another unit, possibly more than once. If this is necessary we commit to you that it will be accomplished in an orderly way, in accordance with the recommendations of public health authorities.

We acknowledge that this information will add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you. Please take advantage of these campus resources for support.

Berkeley,18-Mar-2020,"The adoption of the Bay Area shelter-in-place was a dramatic action that has suddenly changed all of our lives. The University’s employees are permitted by the shelter-in-place orders to continue to come to work in order to carry out the University’s essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work at the campus to perform duties related to distance learning and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and research continuity.

This Executive Order issues directions regarding which employees and faculty members are permitted to come to campus today through April 7, while the Alameda County shelter-in-place order is in effect, for the purpose of carrying out remote instruction and engaging in essential research activities. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.

Please see the detailed information below. These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.

Who this directive covers
This message is a formal employment directive issued by the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost and the Vice Chancellor for Administration and it applies to all employees and faculty, including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers, who are engaged in instruction and research activities. This directive does not apply to those employees who already are working from home except as necessary to support essential activities, consistent with the direction of their supervisor. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Employees and faculty who come to campus for reasons inconsistent with this directive are subject to discipline.

Remote instruction
Employees and faculty members may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. We have suspended our course capture service as of today. As you make the change to fully-remote instruction, please visit our Instructional Resilience Resources site to take advantage of the virtual consultation services (outlined below) offered by Research Teaching and Learning (RLT). The team is here to support you as best as possible as you transition in a virtual environment. We offer individual virtual consultations with staff who can help guide you on best practices and technical tools. Consultation services can be scheduled in the following ways:

For virtual 1:1 consultations with the Center for Teaching and Learning schedule at http://bit.ly/CTL-Consult
For Zoom/bCourses virtual tutorials and webinars with Digital Learning Services schedule at http://bit.ly/DLSconsultations
Research
Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may engage in only those research continuity activities that have been specifically approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. See CalMessages of March 9 and March 17 for further detail. If you are uncertain as to whether the research activity that you are presently supporting is approved to continue during this period, fill in this form by 5 pm today. PIs will be notified about whether they have approval to continue their research on a rolling basis starting March 18, through March 20.

No one supporting the campus research enterprise can come to campus to support or engage in activities that have not been designated by the campus as appropriate. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, please contact the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies, or the Assistant Vice Chancellor for People & Culture.

Building access
Please be advised that suspension of building access (including key-card access) to many campus administrative and research buildings is imminent. This action is necessary to secure and clean campus buildings. Building managers will be informed prior to suspension of access and will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.

Supervisors, chairs, and building managers should begin compiling lists of employees and faculty who will continue to require building access on an exceptional basis in order to enable distance learning activities and research activities approved by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. Employees and faculty who believe that they should have such access should immediately communicate their needs to their supervisor or department chair.

When working from home has limitations
Instructors and the staff who support them may come to campus in order to access the internet and other campus resources for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. No employee or faculty member supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their office to work, for purposes other than delivering instruction, solely because their home internet access is not adequate or because their conditions at home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently.  The University understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. The campus has adopted an emergency procurement process to enable employees and faculty to obtain equipment and internet access to enable them to work from home. Employees and faculty who need these resources should request them from their supervisor or Chair.

A word of thanks
We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and reiterate that these changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place order, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university.

Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times, and be well.",902,cal,3
Berkeley,18-Mar-2020,"Our community has pulled together in positive and innovative ways in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The expanding outbreak and the current Bay Area shelter-in-place orders mandate that we be more explicit in how we respond to this growing public health challenge.

Further, we understand there may be some confusion or lack of clarity regarding what members of the campus community can do in their work capacity (and when they should and should not come to campus to work) in light of previous campus messages and various shelter-in-place orders, including from Alameda County and the City of Berkeley. This memo supersedes all earlier communications, except the Executive Order regarding distance learning and research issued earlier today.

The information below reflects directives from the University; they are not guidelines. All employees, staff and students must adhere to these directives. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Employees and faculty may be disciplined for failing to observe these directives.

Dos
Do come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation of the University. If you believe that the operation you are supporting is not essential but there is an expectation that you come to work anyway, you may seek confirmation of the essential nature of your work by emailing the Chief Human Resources Officer.

Do come to campus if your supervisor directs you to do so for a specific or limited purpose, even if you are generally working from home. You are allowed to come to work for this purpose.

Do feel free to park in any designated campus parking lot if you are directed to come to work.  Daytime parking lot enforcement has been suspended so that employees may avoid taking public transportation if they choose to do so.

Do feel free to visit the campus COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address loneliness and isolation that may occur while we are  under the shelter-in-place order.

Don’ts
Do not come to work if you are sick.

Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave.

Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down or continuity work as approved and directed by the Vice Chancellor for Research. Separate, specific guidance has been issued to campus researchers.

Do not come to work solely because your home internet access is inadequate, or because the conditions at your home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently.  The University understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. The campus has adopted an emergency procurement process to enable employees and faculty to obtain equipment and internet access to enable them to work from home. Employees and faculty who need these resources should address their needs with their supervisor or department chair.

Do not come to campus because there is something in your office that you would like to retrieve, or because you want to visit with colleagues who must work on campus. You should only be coming to campus if your supervisor has given you express permission  to do so. Your supervisor can give you permission to come to campus on a one-time basis or as otherwise necessary.

We know that these are challenging times and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through these issues. These directives are designed to further protect our campus community and give you confidence that your work is consistent with the shelter-in-place orders in the Bay Area. These directives are intended to safeguard the maintenance of the campus’s essential and critical operations. Please take care of yourselves and be well.

Berkeley,17-Mar-2020,"Over the weekend, public health officials confirmed a UC Berkeley graduate student has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). The individual is self-isolating and is in good condition and has no serious symptoms. Public health officials have determined that there are no high risk contacts from this case, meaning no one is at significantly higher risk of contracting it from the infected individual than would be expected in the general population. You should continue to monitor your health and if you exhibit COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath), contact your physician or University Health Services (UHS). More information can be found at news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/ and news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/17/what-uc-berkeley-students-need-to-know-about-coronavirus/.

We recognize that moving to remote instruction for the remainder of the semester, dealing with the shelter-in-place order, working remotely, facing closures in the community, and possibly juggling childcare responsibilities is incredibly challenging. We are here to support you.

Financial Aid and Scholarships, Other Administrative Support
As a reminder, as long as you remain enrolled in a class through the end of the semester, your financial aid will not be affected by your decision to leave or remain on-campus. Additionally, future residency determinations will take into account these special circumstances – you won’t be penalized for leaving.

We continue to provide online and phone advising for billing and payment, financial aid, and registrar inquiries. Common requests:

For additional financial aid, apply for an Emergency Loan and select the EFT (Direct Deposit) option or submit a Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request.
Sign up for Direct Deposit, a fast, convenient, safe, and reliable way to have payments you receive deposited directly to your bank account. Signing up for direct deposit is the most efficient way to get your payments.
Visit CalCentral, “Profile” to update your local address, if appropriate.
Request Transcripts or Verification of Enrollment. Review the “Academic Records” section in the “My Academics” tab of CalCentral. You will see options for “Transcript – Undergraduate or Graduate Student” and “Enrollment Verification.”
For other billing and payment, financial aid and scholarship, and registrar questions, Cal Student Central (CSC) is offering advising services via phone and online only. Contact us weekdays from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. and 1 p.m.-4 p.m. at (510) 664-9181 or create a case online at any time. CSC is responding to all cases within three business days.

The Cal 1 Card office will provide services remotely via email at cal1card@berkeley.edu and phone at (510) 643-6839. In-person support services (for card replacement, for example) will be available by appointment (Tuesdays and Thursdays between 11 a.m. – 3 p.m.) via the online flex-appointment scheduler.

The Cal Student Store in the ASUC Student Union is temporarily closed. You can still shop their robust online selection, including caps and gowns, with limited time free shipping. Check their website for updates and information on how to pick up your pre-ordered caps and gowns.

For all other departments, refrain from visiting an office in-person. Check their website for service adjustments and further directions. Many services can be completed online or via email which helps support social distancing and the safety of our students and staff.

Housing
Students in on-campus housing should watch for additional messages with more details. If you live in on-campus undergraduate housing and choose to end your contract, you can estimate your refund. You will receive one full installment refund along with a partial installment refund based on your cancellation date – April 1, April 10, or April 20. For reference, there are 10 installments for the year (five in the Fall and five in the Spring). You can see all of the installments in CalCentral under “My Finances,” “Billing Summary”. Your decision to stay or move out will not affect your financial aid package. Students will receive their refund minus any outstanding charges (only affects a very small number of students).

Students in off-campus private residence (apartments or houses), may be responsible for paying rent for the remainder of the term of your lease. Read more about terminating your lease at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/terminatinglease.

Supporting Your Physical Health
Students are encouraged to contact the UHS advice line (Nurse Advice Line (24/7) at (510) 643-7197) if they have symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, or had close sustained contact with a known positive case of COVID-19 (as a reminder, public health officials have determined the graduate student who tested positive did not have high risk contacts). We encourage everyone to view the helpful resource information we have circulated, including social distancing and tips on proper hygiene, such as lathering your hands and washing for at least 20 seconds, on the UHS website.

Supporting Your Mental Health
As the situation continues to evolve feelings of uncertainty, anxiety and fear can be overwhelming. Students, faculty and staff are dealing with sudden changes to their regular schedules and worry about what comes next for themselves, friends and family.  We encourage you to reach out for support if you need it. Counselors at University Health Services (UHS) at the Tang Center are available for urgent concerns: Counseling and Psychological Services website or (510) 642-9494 (after-hours counseling line (855) 817-5667). We also offer students support with medical withdrawal (for physical or psychological reasons), if appropriate. Here are some additional tips to help:

Be proactive about managing stress
Taking care of your physical and emotional health during uncertain times is key. Get tipis and resources around mental health and coping.
Pay attention to your stress level and prioritize stress management. Practice self care by talking to friends, exercising, and taking breaks will help your academic performance.
Visit recalibrate for wellness information and resources targeted at the entire campus community.
Sleep
There is good evidence that high-quality sleep (roughly 7-9 hours for the average person) significantly improves task performance, learning, and memory.
Sleep and anxiety are often interrelated and improving sleep quality appears to lessen generalized anxiety.
Seek help
Getting help is a sign of strength and resiliency. Visit the Office of the Dean of Students’ Mental Health Matters to learn how we are in this together.
If stress is interfering with your life (socially or academically) or if you find yourself depressed or anxious for weeks or longer, this will interfere with your ability to learn and perform academically. Talk to a professional mental health counselor. Confidential campus counselors at University Health Services at the Tang Center are available on a drop-in basis for urgent concerns. There are also new online self-help tools. Visit the CAPS website, call Counseling and Psychological Services at (510) 642-9494, or, when the Tang Center is closed, call the after-hours counseling line (855) 817-5667.
It’s okay if you need help. You are not alone. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 800-273-TALK (8255).
In addition to taking care of yourself, please be mindful of other students facing similar challenges this time of year. Download the Just in Case Berkeley mobile app to get tips to help you cope or help a friend and emergency information.

Staying Healthy
We continue to encourage hand-washing and social distancing by leaving at least 6 ft. of space between yourself and others when you are outside of your room or apartment. This includes walking around outside, eating at a dining hall, or visiting the library. Here are some other ways to stay healthy.

Finally, please continue to keep our Principles of Community in mind. Don’t forget to practice grace, empathy, and compassion towards yourself and others. We will get through this moment in time together.",1236,cal,3

Berkeley,16-Mar-2020,"Following up on a campus wide message earlier today and in response to a rapidly changing environment around COVID-19 and the urgent need to practice social distancing, the campus is taking the following actions. These directives are consistent with and authorized by recently announced “shelter in place” guidance from several Bay Area counties, including Alameda County and the City of Berkeley.

Instruction
Effective immediately, all in-person instruction is cancelled for the remainder of the semester unless and until the campus announces that in-person instruction may resume. There will be no exceptions. Kudos and thanks to instructors and our Digital Learning Services staff for making the majority of our courses remotely accessible; we must continue to move aggressively in this direction. As reported earlier, remote instruction will be provided through the end of the semester. Executive Vice Chancellor & Provost Paul Alivisatos and Academic Senate Chair Oliver O’Reilly will communicate more specific information to instructors.

Housing/Dining
As we advised earlier, students who live in campus housing and Blackwell Hall may choose to leave Berkeley and obtain prorated relief from the payment obligations of their housing contracts. The Berkeley health department has confirmed that the “shelter in place” order does not prevent students from moving out of our student housing facilities to reside somewhere else.  We will keep residence and dining facilities open under these emergency circumstances so long as there is a need to do so. More information is available at the COVID-19 Housing website.  The Basic Needs Center, including the Food Pantry, will move to 103 Sproul Hall.

Research
Our research community is directed to immediately transition to work remotely whenever possible. Principal Investigators should suspend on-campus research to the greatest extent possible, immediately, and implement plans to operate remotely at least through April 7. Essential access, limited to sustaining research capability, such as animal care, servicing of critical instrumentation, and maintenance of germ lines, will be authorized by the Vice Chancellor for Research Office in coordination with Deans and Chairs. Exceptional access will be considered by a campus review process, which is currently being developed, modeled on the one at the University of California, San Francisco. Please visit the Vice Chancellor for Research website for specific information and more detailed guidance. The VC Research will also send out a more specific email with guidance on identification of critical research continuity needs.

Staff
Staff who are not explicitly instructed to work at  the campus in person should not come to work. Managers and supervisors will assess what services need to continue on the campus to protect and serve students in residence and maintain other critical operations, such as delivery of remote learning, student housing/dining, University Health Services, etc. Employees will receive direction from their managers if they are required to come to the campus in order to work.  People who are working from home should continue to do so.  California Gov. Newsom has advised anyone over the age of 65 to remain at home; the campus intends to support this goal. More specific information is forthcoming to managers and supervisors.

Libraries, Student Spaces and Events
All libraries will be closed. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Student Union, Eshleman Hall and Cesar Chavez Hall will be closed. The Recreational Sports Facility (RSF) will be closed.  Many other campus facilities have already closed or will be closed, check their websites for current information.  The campus will assess whether limited operation of these facilities is possible and will announce the conditions under which these facilities may reopen if operation of the facilities is determined to be both consistent with public health directives and feasible.

All public events planned to take place on the campus prior to April 7, 2020, should be cancelled or rescheduled.  No new event reservations should be accepted by any facility manager until further notice. We have not yet made a decision about commencement-related events in May.

General campus operations
When buildings close tonight, they will remain locked and will require card-key access for entry. If your building has metal key entry, consult with your manager to determine your need and ability to gain access.

Cleaning of public spaces has increased. Custodial staff is being informed about when special or deep cleaning is warranted and is responding accordingly. We greatly appreciate the extra efforts that our staff are making.

We realize this information and these directives might add to already heightened anxiety and fear. We are making these decisions based on our interest in protecting the members of our community and the vulnerable populations in the greater Bay Area. We look forward to the day when we can return to normal operations and the vibrant, bustling campus that we all know and love. For now, though, we strongly urge everyone to take measures to protect your own health and safety and that of the community at large and to practice social distancing. There is helpful guidance about social distancing in this New York Times article and interesting simulations about the impact of social distancing in this Washington Post article. In the interest of mental and physical health (and in keeping with various county and city directives), we urge you to try to get outside (maintaining a distance of six feet between you and others). The American Psychological Association posted this advice, which you may also find helpful.

Also, please note that while the shelter in place guidance appears to be very broad, it does have certain exceptions including for essential services and certain entities, including institutions of higher education like ours. We are being careful not to direct any of our employees to do anything that could violate this order. In addition, the county and city orders state that those sheltering in place may engage in “essential activities as necessary for the health and safety for individuals and their families.”

The University Health Services website and the campus COVID-19 website are both valuable sources of information and are being continually updated. We are deeply grateful to those working in University Health Services who continue to care for the members of our community.

This is an unprecedented and dramatic event, yet we are in many ways well prepared for emergencies such as this. We are committed to doing all we can to support our students and employees. Please take care of yourselves and each other. Together, we will get through this.",1069,cal,3
Berkeley,16-Mar-2020,"In light of Alameda County and the City of Berkeley’s announcement advising county residents to shelter in place beginning Tuesday, March 17 at 12:01 a.m. through Tuesday, April 7, we are rapidly moving toward a “maintenance-only” mode of physical operation of the campus.

Generally speaking, this means that all in-person instruction should cease. All instruction that can be delivered remotely should continue.

Labs should ramp down normal operations, and shift to basic maintenance, ensuring safety and preservation of future capability.

With rare exceptions (including those in student-facing functions that cannot be offered remotely like housing, dining, and University Health Services and critical operations such as UCPD, facilities, custodial, information systems and technology, maintenance of certain critical research specimens, etc.), employees should return home as soon as they are able, and where possible, work remotely.

Generally, employees should assume they will work from home through April 7 unless they hear otherwise from their managers. For those who cannot work from home due to the nature of their job, UCOP is working on systemwide guidance which they will issue shortly.

We are working quickly to gather more information and will provide additional details later this afternoon. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

We are coordinating closely with public health officials and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  state and local health guidance in responding to this case. University Health Services (UHS) professionals are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who need to be advised about their contacts with this student.

We understand that this news is unsettling, but we want to assure you that your health and safety remain our number one priority. Facilities personnel will be alerted and will provide deep cleaning to any appropriate areas. We are also coordinating to make sure that the student is getting the care needed.

Due to privacy concerns, we will not release any information involving specific student records or private health care information, but our safety protocols have been activated in order to mitigate further exposure.

We understand that some members of our community may be concerned that they have the virus. This may include circumstances where you have had contact with someone you believe or know to have the virus. Students should contact the UHS advice line at (510) 643-7197, and faculty and staff should contact their medical providers, if they have symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, or had close sustained contact with a known positive case of COVID-19. Most other situations simply require self-monitoring for symptoms, reasonable social distancing strategies, good hand-washing and cough etiquette, and regular cleaning of frequently- touched surfaces. Faculty, staff and students are strongly encouraged to stay home when ill.

The virus is circulating within our broader community, and as tests become more widely available, we will hear of more confirmed cases. This is a reality that the campus has been preparing for and is ready for, in terms of protocols established in coordination with local public health authorities and in our new policies designed to limit large gatherings on campus.

In the meantime, we encourage everyone to view the helpful resource information, including tips on proper hygiene, such as lathering your hands and washing for at least 20 seconds, as well as mental health resources, on the UHS website.

The situation regarding COVID-19 is dynamic, and, consequently, guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information.

Berkeley,13-Mar-2020,"With local schools temporarily closing due to coronavirus concerns, many of our employees will have to take time off work to provide childcare. We will now grant up to 14 days of paid administrative leave for employees who have to stay home, and who are unable to work remotely, because they must provide childcare to their children whose schools have closed due to coronavirus concerns. Managers and supervisors are asked to grant their employees permission for these requests.",78,cal,3
Berkeley,13-Mar-2020,"We have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely via Zoom, teleconferencing and other virtual platforms for lecture, discussion, and seminar courses (as well as other types of courses such as laboratory, clinic, and studio courses, that have already successfully developed strategies for remote learning) through the end of the semester. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority.

We also are committed to preserving our academic mission. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to more students in non-lecture courses and settings. For the small number of courses that do not have a remote option, students will need to get guidance from their instructors on how they are adopting social distancing practices, which ideally leaves six feet of space between individuals. More information to instructors is forthcoming today.

We will support students and families in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break. They will be allowed to do so. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.).
Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees if they decide to move out.  The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts from students who decide to move out of campus housing and Blackwell Hall for the remainder of this academic year.  The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid by these students, based upon their effective move-out date. Students will have the choice to receive relief from payment obligations based upon an effective move-out date of April 1, April 10, or April 20. Students who want to move out must complete their written request and move out prior to April 20.  The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the student’s campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student’s housing costs are covered by the student’s financial aid package. FAQS, further guidance, specific details, and online forms to complete to obtain housing refunds are being developed and will be published no later than Monday, March 16.
Bowles Hall, International House (I-House), co-ops, fraternities and sororities, private apartments and other housing facilities not owned by the campus have their own housing policies. Please contact your building/house manager for details. In the event your current housing will close down and you do not have other options or would prefer to stay in Berkeley, please contact Cal Housing for assistance in securing a university housing contract.

Depending on the guidance and direction of public health officials regarding COVID-19 in the coming weeks, it is possible that the campus may generally resume in-person instruction at some point during the semester. If in-person instruction resumes, in-person course attendance will continue to not be mandatory for the rest of the semester. Students who are able to make a decision now to finish this semester remotely are welcome to do so.

We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. Supervisors are encouraged to explore work assignments that these students could perform remotely over a number of weeks. If such arrangements cannot be worked out, under UC systemwide policy, students may receive two weeks of paid administrative leave. Many students work a few hours a week, so such a leave could cover many weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.

Despite this decision regarding instruction, critical campus functions, including our research enterprise and student support services, remain operational, some with adjusted service hours. We will rely on individual units to communicate any changes with your constituents. We have advised that managers and supervisors offer flexible work arrangements for employees when possible, yet we recognize that many of our operations require employees to be on campus.

Currently there are no positive cases of COVID-19 related to any members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated University Health Services professionals and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely.

Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “flatten the curve,” and slow the spread of COVID-19, respect those around you in accordance with our Principles of Community, stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus, and be well.",878,cal,3
Berkeley,12-Mar-2020,"In our prior message, we reiterated the encouragement to make arrangements for your employees to work remotely, but our message was not clear enough. In order to increase social distancing in the workplace, managers and supervisors must proactively work with their employees, including student employees, to develop plans for most employees to work remotely.

The campus is still open but in order for us to shift more quickly to alternative work arrangements, you should begin entering into Temporary Remote Work Agreements immediately.

Alternative Work Arrangements
For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented,\ and student workers), managers and employees should work together to develop a remote work plan to complete special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training. In developing a remote work plan, managers should be mindful of employees who may not have internet access. Some training recommendations are included at the end of this message.

As a reminder, our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to report to work.

Flexible Scheduling
Subject to the needs of the University, managers should consider flexible work arrangements such as having employees work on-site with reduced shifts (fewer hours or fewer days). This can be coupled with remote work assignments for the time not spent on-site.

Use of Sick Leave and Paid Administrative Leave
For specific guidance on the use of sick leave and paid administrative leave please refer to the guidance provided by the UC Office of the President. For assistance in applying the guidance to specific situations, please consult with the Academic Personnel Office, your Regional HR Manager or People & Culture.

Next steps
We appreciate the burden that these significant operational changes place on our employees and thank you in advance for your cooperation. Your flexibility and support are indispensable as we move forward together as a community. Please contact the Academic Personnel Office, your Regional HR managers or People & Culture for assistance in managing any employment-related issues.

Training, learning and development recommendations
As part of developing a remote work plan, managers should work with their employees to identify opportunities for both training and learning & development. The top training priority is the mandatory compliance training, which includes Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training for managers and supervisors and for staff, Ethics and Cybersecurity training. The next priority for the campus community is Unconscious Bias Training.

For learning & development, all employees, especially managers and supervisors, should consider completing the online management program, Grow Today. This fully online workshop series is designed for all staff, from seasoned people leaders to those desiring to become a manager, supervisor, or team lead. It includes the core curriculum of the UC People Management Certificate and the full curriculum for the UC Implicit Bias Certificate.

You can also take this time to prepare to ‘Achieve Together’ (our new Performance Management program) by visiting our updated website, which now includes FAQs, program guides and employee training. You can also check out our online learning opportunities for both individual contributors and managers/supervisors.

We also recommend checking out our transferable skills library. This provides curated learning paths from our partners at LinkedIn Learning, which is another source of development opportunities that all members of our UC Berkeley community can access.

Remote work resources

Berkeley,11-Mar-2020,"As part of our ongoing effort to take proactive measures to limit the potential spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, today we announce new changes that will remain in effect at least through March 29.

Campus spaces and venues will not be available for any event with 100 or more expected attendees.
Intercollegiate Athletics events on campus will be held without spectators.
Cal Performances events through March 29 will be canceled.
Cal Day, which was scheduled for April 18, has been canceled.

We need to maintain many operations even as much of our instruction is being transitioned to an online format, and we are seeking your support to provide increased “social distancing.” As described below, we have developed a Temporary Remote Work Agreement that can be used to document modifications to an employee’s regular work location, assignments, and schedule.

Alternative work arrangements
We continue to encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all employees, including student employees, in caring for their health – and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 – while still enabling them to continue to perform the important work they do. Our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to report to work.

Berkeley,9-Mar-2020,"Today I am announcing new campus actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. There are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time; however, as local, national, and global public health recommendations shift to include mitigation of transmission, the campus is proactively taking steps that will help to protect the community.

For more
The latest information on the campus response can be found on the coronavirus information page.

A more detailed version of this memo is also available.

These changes are effective starting Tuesday, March 10, and will remain in place through Spring Break, which ends March 29. A decision on what will happen on March 30 and beyond will occur at a later date, based on the latest coronavirus information at that time.

Instruction
Beginning Tuesday, March 10, we will be suspending most in-person classes and will be offering ALL lecture courses (including discussion sections), seminar instruction and examination through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom, course capture, etc.) through Spring Break.
Instructors who do not have remote learning processes in place by March 10 will be given a two-day period (March 10 and 11) during which they may cancel classes, to allow them time to establish such processes and to ready their course(s) for resumption online by Thursday, March 12. Students, please look for communications from instructors about plans for individual courses.
Courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate will continue to meet in person. For the time being, this will include all laboratory, performing arts, and physical education courses, although they are encouraged to minimize in-person meetings as appropriate.
Events
All campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 150 attendees will be canceled or postponed. These include events put on by the administration or an academic department and scheduled to take place through March 29. This does not include events scheduled by Cal Performances or Intercollegiate Athletics; however, those events should include generous refund policies for anyone who wishes not to attend for any reason. Guidance will be forthcoming regarding registered student organization events.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 150 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
Campus Operations
The campus is not closing. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations will proceed normally, including student housing and dining and research support operations. Please note, however, that there may be some limitations in operations and services as managers will be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided soon.
More detailed information on these matters is posted on the campus’s coronavirus information website. Additional details, and the most up-to-date news, for students and instructors pertaining to instruction will be posted on the Instructional Resilience Resources page.

We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice will have broad impacts and will be challenging and disruptive for many of you, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. We are grateful to the staff throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts on our behalf during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles. Your work is critically important at this time and we greatly value you and your contributions.

In our assessment of the current situation, including the likelihood that the Berkeley campus could have a coronavirus case here at any time, we believe that this is the best action for our campus community and the broader Berkeley community.

We will continue to update you on this issue with information posted on the new coronavirus information website. Information on the virus and related health and safety information is available on the special University Health Services website. Students, please share this message with your family and any concerned parties.",642,cal,3
Berkeley,6-Mar-2020,"The last few weeks have been difficult as we have learned of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to locations across the globe, in various cities in the United states, and in our local community.

I want to acknowledge the profound concern, anxiety, and worry that this virus and its consequences have created for so many of us, and our hearts go out to those who have fallen ill in this epidemic. We will get through this together as a community by relying on and supporting each other.

While there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus, we know that there are confirmed cases in neighboring areas, and it could very well happen on the Berkeley campus at any time. Consequently, we want to be as prepared and ready as possible, so that we can move quickly should we need to.

You may have seen the memo to instructors advising that they begin planning more ways to offer their course content and lectures outside of the classroom, predominantly online. We have also encouraged supervisors and managers to, where possible, allow employees to work from home. These are baseline measures that we would ramp up quickly, and perhaps broadly across campus, if circumstances warrant such actions.

Today we are calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that in the near future we will need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually as much as possible.

Campus events and activities are proceeding as planned right now, and in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no local guidance to limit events, but we stand prepared to take such action if and when needed.

Any campus decision to take broad actions, such as ending all classroom instruction or eliminating large events on campus, would be made in consultation with local public health authorities and the University of California Office of the President.

While some other universities in California and elsewhere may have taken more far-reaching actions, such as ending all classroom instruction and turning solely to remote learning, they take such actions in consultation with their local health officials, informed by the number of cases and community spread in their local area.

This situation is very fluid, and it could change very quickly in the Berkeley area, requiring, again, that we change course at a moment’s notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on the virus itself and other health information posted on the UHS website. For the latest information about campus actions and campus operations visit our coronavirus information platform that launched today.

Although anyone could suffer from coronavirus exposure, we also recognize that some are especially vulnerable, including older persons, and those with significant underlying health conditions.

Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.

Berkeley,6-Mar-2020,"Here are a few excerpts, edited for length, from the AMA:

Question from Akhenatenaten: What will the administration do to ensure an equal academic opportunity to succeed for those who acquire the virus? How will they proceed, sooner rather than later, to protect all students equally from coronavirus?
For more
The latest information on the campus response can be found on the coronavirus information page.

Paul Alivisatos, executive vice chancellor and provost: There are many protocols that we have or are putting in place to protect our community, and they touch nearly every aspect of the campus. We are encouraging instructors to move classes online and facilitating this change. We are asking instructors to relax attendance rules. We are building guidelines for student travel. We are developing telecommuting guidelines for staff. We are weighing whether to hold large events on campus, with guidance from local health authorities. RSSP is creating contingency plans for what will happen if and when a campus community member tests positive for coronavirus. We have and will continue to communicate these issues in regular emails about the situation. Up-to-date information is also available here.

Ella Callow, director, disability access & compliance chief: Disabled students have a right to be safe and healthy, and get their education. The tools are in place right now to help facilitate this. If going to class is a risk for you due to coronavirus, go to your Disabled Students’ Program Specialist. Talk to them about amending your Letter of Accommodation to include that the class must be made accessible to you through the use of the Instructional Resilience resources available to professors and GSIs. If you haven’t used DSP services yet, go online and check them out here.

Question from 127-0-0-1_1: Will the administration enforce policies that allow people who highly suspect they have coronavirus to avoid large events without objectively harming their grade?
Guy Nicolette, assistant vice chancellor for University Health Services: If you highly suspect you have the virus — i.e. you have fever or cough/difficulty breathing and you have traveled to any area with sustained transmission within the two weeks before symptoms start or you have had contact with a proven case — you should call your healthcare provider (for faculty/staff) or the UHS Advice Line (for students) at 510-643-7197 immediately for advice. This does not necessarily mean you have the virus, but you should put on a mask and get assessed as soon as possible. Strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for coronavirus; these are updated regularly as the situation evolves.

Callow: The Cal messages that were sent out on March 2 and March 4 from the Provost and Chair of the Academic Senate address some of your concerns.

Question from sprucegoose11: Are there protocols being developed to deep-clean and disinfect classrooms, public spaces, campus shuttles to mitigate the spread of the virus?
Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration: The campus has indeed enhanced disinfection and cleaning procedures for common areas. We have expanded our day service to clean and disinfect touch points in public areas, restrooms, and entrances, (ie. door knobs, elevator buttons, water fountains).

We have installed hand sanitizer dispensing stations in high-traffic visible areas across campus, and especially entrances to buildings, though we want to underscore that frequent hand-washing can be more effective than hand sanitizing. We will also be expanding our regular custodial coverage from weekly to daily in classrooms, labs, and conference areas.

Question from sprucegoose11: Will our Student Health Insurance Plan cover testing costs for the virus? Will the Tang center be testing students?
Nicolette: There is no cost to students for testing of those people that meet the CDC criteria for testing. Call the UHS Advice Line at 510-643-7197 if you believe you might have this illness, and we will help guide the next steps. Faculty/staff need to contact their healthcare provider, unless they believe they were infected in the course of their required duties at UCN (e.g. healthcare providers, UCPD), in which case they can also contact Occupational Health at 510-642-6891.

Question from sprucegoose11: Does campus administration advise against traveling over spring break?
Fisher: We are recommending students follow the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Department of State recommendations for personal travel. CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. Aside from any risk from coronavirus itself, the transportation bans and infrastructure disruption are significant. It is also possible that U.S. borders might close to re-entry from some areas, making it challenging to return.

Steve Sutton, vice chancellor for student affairs: There will soon be a short spring break travel survey from the Division of Student Affairs that will help us understand students’ spring break travel plans. We encourage students who receive an email invitation to please fill out this form, as it helps the campus better prepare. Cal Dining will be providing service over Spring Break for students who remain on campus. There will be service at the Crossroads location Sunday, March 22 through Saturday, March 28, with hours of service to include brunch 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and dinner 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Questions from neuralsurfer2000: Why hasn’t UC Berkeley already taken strong action in the form of cancelling classes/shifting them to all online?
Oliver O’Reilly, chair, Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate: Our goal and hope is to be able to continue instruction, modified as necessary. We are actively recommending that faculty use technology to accommodate students and to discourage sick students from coming to campus. To date, many departments have been adopting the recommendations, however we are aware that some have not – I shared a message with department chairs last night to strongly encourage they do so.

Should the public health officials advise the campus community to limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other, faculty who adopted the recommendations will enable the campus to maintain instructional continuity and ensure that students will continue to make academic progress. Instructors who haven’t adopted the recommendations will be in a very difficult position and may be unable to continue teaching their courses. This will put their students in an even more challenging position and will put the faculty member at odds with their responsibilities.

Question from sharksuki: What conditions have to be met for you to justifiably (by your definition) cancel classes?
Alivisatos: We are monitoring conditions on campus and in very close contact with the CDC and local public health officials (Berkeley Public Health and others). We would use their expert guidance, as well as consultation with the UC Office of the President, to make a decision like this. It is likely we would require all classes to move online before making the decision to cancel them.

Questions from pm-me-historyfacts: Given the high density of people in the dorms, it’s possible that just a few people could infect huge numbers of people. What is the administration doing to be proactive in high risk situations like this?
Sutton: We are currently bringing in an existing outside vendor to provide deep cleaning services for dorms and other spaces. I responded more fully to this above, but Residential Student Service Programs has plans in place to move students who are confirmed to have COVID-19 to isolation spaces (with beds, showers, kitchenette) and to have food delivered to them. If experts believe that multiple people within a dorm/floor have been exposed, we plan on quarantining floors and again providing food delivery.

Questions from pm-me-historyfacts: What is the recommendation on travel outside the U.S.? In the case that students are stuck in other countries, what can they do?
Fisher: Our recommendation is to follow CDC guidance, which currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. The CDC is advising social distancing strategies, including staying home for 14 days, for individuals returning from these countries. Please check the travel guidance on our website for more info here.

Question from usernoob23: What are you actually doing to help mitigate the effect once it reaches UC Berkeley?
Nicolette: We have already amended our triage processes (online and nurse-staffed) to enhance our ability to take care of as many people as possible while minimizing the risk of exposure to others, and we will do so further should there be a case on campus. UHS operations are planning to convert to a higher volume mass assessment model should we face an outbreak situation, changing our appointment model, separating patient flow, and potentially conducting triage outside the building.

We are setting up contracts with temp agencies to provide additional staff and have been preparing for adapted use of medical equipment to make it stretch further, in alignment with CDC guidance. We are also preparing our mental health staff to be better able to support our students, and our occupational health and employee assistance programs to do the same for faculty/staff.",1480,cal,3
Berkeley,6-Mar-2020,"As concerns over the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak intensify at the local, national, and international levels, incidents of xenophobia and anti-Asian racism, harassment, and bullying on campus also have increased. These behaviors have no place at UC Berkeley.

While we should exercise caution against infection from coronavirus, we also should stand firm in rejecting all forms of anti-Asian sentiment and other xenophobia in the guise of fear of COVID-19.

The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans notes, “While the coronavirus represents a legitimate public health concern, it is not a ‘green light’ to target Asian Americans and Asian immigrants with racism and hate.”

As reflected in our campus Principles of Community, we must remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our campus community, regardless of race or country of origin, feel welcome, safe, and respected.

UC Berkeley prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation/identity and/or sexual violence status. If you have experienced physical assaults, hate crimes, and/or threats of violence, you have the right to report them to UCPD and the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD). Concerns about hateful incidents or messages also can be made via stophate.berkeley.edu, our systemwide portal for making those reports.

For confidential support and care, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers drop-in services for students at the Tang Center and its satellite offices. Services for staff, faculty, visiting scholars, and postdocs are available through Be Well at Work.

When each day of late seems to bring a new challenge, let’s be intentional with our time and care to check on and support each other in respectful and meaningful ways.",280,cal,3
Berkeley,6-Mar-2020,"We recognize that the COVID-19 outbreak and our decisions in response to that outbreak affect our entire community, including the staff, students, and faculty who work and study here. This means that for many of you, the steps we are taking to protect the health of our community may involve significant inconvenience and personal sacrifice. With your crucial assistance, we have managed our way through power outages, air-quality concerns, and more. Please accept our thanks for your continued cooperation, patience, and understanding.

As a reminder, people should not come to work if they feel ill. In addition, vulnerable populations, including older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions, should strongly consider ways to work remotely and limit exposure to the larger campus community.

Alternative Work Arrangements
We are encouraging all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all their employees in caring for their health — and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 — while still enabling them to continue to perform the important work they do.

One effective strategy for minimizing the spread of COVID-19 is greater “social distancing” through alternative work arrangements. In situations where work can temporarily be performed from home or an alternate location, we encourage managers and employees to work together to identify opportunities to allow employees to work remotely (telecommute). If alternative work arrangements are not a possibility, employees should continue to come to work as usual, unless the situation changes.

Social distancing can also be accomplished by using technology (Zoom or teleconferencing) to reduce the number of meetings involving large numbers of people.

Represented employees and student workers
Please be mindful that hourly, represented, and student workers may have different levels of job flexibility; hence, please take that into account in your strategy and responses.

Resources
For guidance on working remotely, please visit the Telecommunications Policy Website. For managers seeking additional guidance on how to manage remote workers, we encourage you to take advantage of our LinkedIn Learning resources. Technology-related guidance and resources for telecommuting are available on the Technology Resources page.

Please contact Regional HR managers or People & Culture for assistance in managing any employment-related issues.

Next steps
As we continue to work through the uncertainty caused by the spread of COVID-19, we hope that we can be sensitive to each other’s needs in this situation and make accommodations when we can. Campus leaders are continuing to meet daily to think through these issues and assess options should circumstances require the campus to take broad action to reduce potential exposure.

We have every confidence in our community’s ability to pull together with kindness, care, and compassion. And we count on every member of our community to guard against the stereotyping and xenophobia that sometimes accompany disease outbreaks.",468,cal,3
Berkeley,6-Mar-2020,"We are writing today to share with you the latest updates, policies and general guidance regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) and travel.

Please keep in mind that as we take steps to help ensure the health and safety of our community we also want to be respectful of everyone. We ask everyone to follow our Principles of Community and learn more about stigma and how to correct it with facts and information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Work-related, non-essential travel
The University of California, Office of the President (UCOP) systemwide policy limits faculty, staff and student work-related travel to impacted countries if the work is non-essential. Initially, this was for countries with a CDC risk level of 3, however, yesterday UCOP announced that it was expanding the list to Level 2 countries. We encourage everyone to view the continually updated information on travel posted on the campus Global Engagement Office website for more information.

If your business travel has been canceled as a result of the coronavirus and you were not able to obtain a full refund of some or all of your expenses, you have options for requesting reimbursement, which can vary depending on how you booked your travel. We’ve outlined these options on the travel website.

If you are still planning to travel for business and booked the travel outside of the UC Travel Portal, Connexxus, but have not yet registered the trip for travel insurance, please be sure to register immediately, as the UC provided travel insurance program will cover trip cancellation or interruption (up to $2,000) as a result of the coronavirus and medical expenses up to $500,000 when traveling outside of the U.S.

We understand that news about the virus and its spread is concerning and some individuals may be reluctant about travel — domestic or international — right now. We encourage managers and supervisors to review the CDC and UCOP guidance and direct employees with questions to that guidance as well.

Personal travel
We encourage you to follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and U.S. Department of State recommendations for travel. CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. Aside from any risk from coronavirus itself, the transportation bans and infrastructure disruption are significant. It is also possible that U.S. borders might close to re-entry from some areas, making it challenging to return.

Spring break and students
There will soon be a short spring break travel survey from the Division of Student Affairs that will help us understand more about students’ travel plans during the spring break. We encourage students who receive an email invitation to please fill out this form, as it helps the campus to better prepare.

Cal Dining will be providing service over spring break for students who remain on campus. There will be service at the Crossroads location Sunday, March 22 through Saturday, March 28, with hours of service to include brunch 10am-4pm and dinner 5pm-8pm.

Study Abroad
There are no campus-based study-abroad programs operating in the spring semester through the Berkeley Study Abroad office. The system-wide, UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) has canceled its spring and summer programs in China, as well as its spring programs in South Korea and Italy.

UCEAP is working with staff and partners in Italy and South Korea, UCOP and the nine UC campuses to assist students who are currently in those two countries. Students and their parents have received instructions for activating the Trip Interruption Benefit of the UCEAP travel insurance for early departure. UCEAP is coordinating additional financial assistance for travel home and academic support as needed.

As Department of State and CDC updates are released, UCEAP will make decisions about programs in other countries. Likewise, campus-based summer abroad programs managed by the Berkeley Study Abroad office will also rely on Department of State and CDC updates.

International students unable to travel home this summer
We are aware that world events may cause some international students to choose not to return to their home this coming summer. To assist students who may not have summer housing in place, Cal Housing is encouraging these students to register for housing for the 12-week summer session (Session AD). Please visit the Cal Housing website for details. Please note that summer housing stock is limited.

For those students who choose to remain in Berkeley for the summer, Berkeley Summer Sessions offers options that can help keep their academics on track or allow them to gain a new credential.

If you are unclear as to how any of these choices may or may not impact your non-immigrant status you are encouraged to contact the Berkeley International Office.

Guidance to students, faculty, postdocs, staff and visiting scholars and students, regarding travel to campus from impacted countries to work or study at UC Berkeley.
Students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, student researchers and postdocs traveling to campus from mainland China after February 2, 2020 will, per California Dept of Public Health (CDPH) guidance, be screened and quarantined for 14 days after their return with close monitoring by their local public health department.

CDC now also recommends that individuals with a recent travel history from all countries/areas with widespread, ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice countries) stay home for 14 days from the time you left and practice social distancing.The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) echoed this guidance in a directive issued yesterday, stating that such individuals must self-isolate for 14 days.

All UC Berkeley faculty, staff, students, postdocs and other UC affiliates including visiting scholars are asked to call the University Health Services COVID-19 Travel Line at 510-642-6622 upon arrival in the Bay Area. All impacted international visiting scholars, visiting student researchers and postdocs should also contact the Berkeley International Office to ensure that U.S. Department of Homeland Security SEVIS arrival reporting requirements are met and should also notify their host department of their arrival and/or any delays to the start of their program/stay.

CDC guidance instructs individuals traveling from the impacted areas as noted above to:

Stay home and avoid contact with others; not to go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.

Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.
Avoid crowded places (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in public.
Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).
Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.

Berkeley,4-Mar-2020,"We write in follow up to our March 2 message to all instructors regarding planning ahead for instructional resilience. In light of the news yesterday that there is now a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Berkeley, we are providing the following guidance to instructors on holding courses and exams. We are providing this guidance as a precautionary measure, so that students who feel unwell do not feel compelled to attend lectures or take examinations while they are ill.

Instructional guidance
Instructors are asked to review and implement the following instructional guidance:

Holding Classes: In-person classes should continue to be held until advised otherwise. Additionally, instructors are asked, whenever feasible, to offer an online option for their course lecture material (see #2 and #3 below). Instructors who are unwell are asked, as is standard practice, to make arrangements to have their course covered.
Course Capture (Screen Capture with Audio Recording – No Video of Instructor): For classes offered in rooms that are equipped and are not currently using course capture, we are asking for instructors to use the free Screen with Audio Recording option so that students can participate remotely. Email coursecapture@berkeley.edu with your course name to activate this option.
Alternate Means of Recording Classes: For classes offered in rooms where free Course Capture is not available, instructors are encouraged to:
use ZoomPro and a laptop to record lecture slides/audio where strong internet connection is available and share after class through bCourses; or
record audio from your phone/tablet/laptop and share audio file and slide deck through bCourses as separate files; and
share a text version through bCourses.
Attendance Requirements: We are asking instructors to consider suspending any attendance requirements until further notice.
Office Hours: We are asking instructors to consider enabling video conferencing for office hours.
Exams: For examinations during the month of March, we encourage instructors to give take-home exams that are returned to the instructor using the bCourses Quizzes or Assignments functionality. Instructors should accommodate students who are ill.
Labs: Labs should remain open and routine safety measures should continue to be adhered to.
Course Activities and Physical Contact: We recommend instructors consider a no physical contact policy for course activities (e.g., for courses in the departments such as Theatre, Dance and Performing Studies, Physical Education, Maker Spaces, etc.). Additionally, staff, instructors, and students are strongly encouraged to properly clean contact surfaces and equipment before and after use. Facilities Services has also been asked to increase their cleaning services during this period.
Resources
Schedule a virtual or in-person consultation with a DLS consultant for support in using digital methods for teaching. Please feel free to bring a GSI or other member of your teaching staff with you. Drop in consultation services will also be offered in the Academic Innovation Studio (117 Dwinelle) from 9am to 4pm Monday through Friday.
Terry Johnson, Faculty Director of the CTL, will hold a workshop on pedagogical approaches to disruption on Thursday, March 5, from 4:45 p.m.  to 6:00 p.m. To accommodate schedules and capacity an additional, identical workshop will be held the following week. You can attend in person at the Academic Innovation Studio or via Zoom.
Visit the Instructional Resilience Resources page for links to resources, best practices, support, and training materials. Here you will also learn how to access a free ZoomPro account, which allows instructors to offer audio and video streaming for up to 300 participants and sessions lasting up to 24 hours. Instructors offering courses with extremely different needs – from small group seminars to large lectures – have successfully used ZoomPro. Staff are currently on standby anticipating requests from instructors for these accounts.
Please note that a detailed list of accommodations can be found on the Academic Accommodations Hub. An updated set of guidelines for missed days of instruction has also been issued by the Academic Senate.
Instructors who have questions or concerns about implementing our recommendations, please elevate them to your chair for guidance. For issues that are not resolvable at the local level, chairs are encouraged to contact their deans. Should you have other issues that we have not addressed or ideas that might benefit the instructional mission of the campus during these times, please feel free to let us know by sending an email to vcue@berkeley.edu. We will do our utmost to respond in a timely manner.

Thanking you for your efforts in support, patience and wisdom as we collectively navigate this challenging time.",744,cal,3
Berkeley,3-Mar-2020,"Local public health officials have confirmed today one case of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Berkeley. The individual is not affiliated with the campus and, at this time, there is no obvious connection.

The individual is in good condition and is isolating at home. This was a travel-related transmission of the virus, not a local community transmission, according to public health authorities.

For more updates
The latest information on how UC Berkeley is responding to coronavirus

We understand that news of a confirmed case within the city of Berkeley is unsettling. Please keep in mind that the risk to anyone in the general U.S. population remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Precautions
We remind the campus community to take appropriate precautions. Please call your healthcare provider or the University Health Services (UHS) Advice Line for students at (510) 643-7197 immediately if both of the following are true:

You have a fever (>100.3F if measured) or cough/difficulty breathing AND
Travel to any area with sustained transmission within the 2 weeks before symptoms start or contact with a proven case of coronavirus.
This does NOT necessarily mean you have the coronavirus but it means you should put on a mask and get assessed ASAP; if you have the flu UHS can also offer treatment.

The best protection is thorough and frequent hand washing, lathering for at least 20 seconds (hand sanitizer works too), avoiding touching your face, and vaccination for the flu — it’s still here. Keep your work areas and door knobs clean. If you feel ill, stay home.



Regarding masks, while formally fitted N95 masks are required for healthcare providers and personnel assessing or transporting a possible case of COVID-19, they are NOT recommended for the general public. They are not necessary and it is critical to preserve these supplies.

Testing guidelines
Please note that strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for this coronavirus and each test needs to be approved by the public health officer. While each case is evaluated separately, and this may change, UHS and other health clinics are generally NOT currently testing people without a relevant travel history, unless they are severely ill and need to be hospitalized.

Campus support / Health and safety efforts
We understand that this news of a local case can be concerning and result in feelings of anxiousness. For additional information, please continue to visit the University Health Services web pages that contain an FAQ, a video with basic information about the virus, and information about mental health resources.



Campus leaders continue to meet regularly to address prevention and response efforts, which include operations. For example, we are ensuring the safety of the campus environment through measures such as expanded distribution and placement of hand sanitizers and enhanced disinfection and cleaning procedures of common areas.

We will continue to keep the campus updated.",482,cal,3
Berkeley,2-Mar-2020,"A. Paul Alivisatos, UC Berkeley’s executive vice chancellor and provost, and Oliver M. O’Reilly, chair of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, sent the following message to all all faculty, instructors and graduate student instructors on Monday, March 2:

We write to let you know that as of today, Monday March 2, there is no reported case of COVID-19 on the Berkeley campus and a single reported case in Alameda County. In the interests of health and safety, this is an appropriate time for all instructors (e.g., faculty, graduate student instructors, lecturers, etc.) to be prepared in the event that some students, staff, or instructors become ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months, or in the event that the campus needs to temporarily suspend in-person instruction.



As a community we must do our utmost in these challenging times to ensure that our students receive the quality of education they deserve and continue progress towards their academic goals. We also wish to remind instructors that they should accommodate and not penalize students who become ill or are quarantined. We are also committed to protecting the health and safety of our students and our teaching community.

In responses to the disruptions caused by PG&E outages and air quality issues in the recent past, a Task Force for Instructional Resilience was charged in the late Fall to address continuity during times when courses cannot be held on campus as planned. The following recommendations, which we strongly encourage you to consider applying to your courses, have been generated through listening sessions with the campus community, a campus wide survey with 290 responses and hours of task force discussions and working group meetings:

The Center for Teaching & Learning and Digital Learning Services has excellent resources for booking consultations and accessing training materials – including specific training and support on Zoom and bCourses. Here you will also learn how to access a free ZoomPro account which allows instructors to offer courses for up to 24 hours and 300 participants. Staff are currently on standby anticipating requests from instructors for these accounts. If your class has over 300 students email digitallearning@berkeley.edu and staff will assist you. Terry Johnson will hold a workshop at AIS on Thursday March 5 from 4:45pm-6:00pm on Instructional Resilience. The workshop can also be access ed remotely using Zoom. Staff are eager to assist faculty who may not yet be familiar with this technology.
Best practices and preparation checklists for both instructors and students to help prepare for disruptions have been posted on the Instructional Resilience Resources page at teaching.berkeley.edu. We strongly encourage instructors to also review the guidelines for students, so they can anticipate students’ questions and concerns.
Instructors should ensure that they have access to the gradebooks for all of the sections of the classes for which they are instructors of record. For ease of access, instructors are strongly encouraged to use the gradebook facility in bCourses. This will provide back up should an instructor/GSI fall ill. We also advise that the instructor of record consider delegating access to the bCourses gradebook to their department chair.
Provisions should also be made with an instructor’s department so that an alternate instructor or graduate student instructor is on standby should the instructor or graduate student instructor become ill or quarantined and unable to teach.
Instructors are encouraged to consider assessments and exams that accommodate student illness and possible lack of access to campus. Provisions should also be put in place so that the final exam can be administered and graded should the instructor become ill or placed under quarantine.
The Academic Senate’s Committee on Courses and Instruction (COCI) has issued guidelines for single-incident disruption of classes to assist in managing reduced days of instruction.
Should local public health officials advise that we limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other, we believe the preliminary recommendations and information provided above will help you plan ahead. The task force will continue to develop recommendations and work with the campus to develop resources that will support instructional resilience into the future.

We realize these are times of uncertainty and concern and we thank you for your patience and wisdom in navigating these challenges. For the sake of our students and staff, it is important that we are as prepared as possible all the while hoping that our precautions will prove to be unnecessary. Should you have any ideas or concerns please feel free to share them with the Instructional Resilience Task Force by emailing vcue@berkeley.edu We will do our utmost to respond in a timely manner and adopt your ideas if we believe they will be effective. Thanking you for your efforts in support of the educational mission of our campus.",792,cal,3
Berkeley,2-Mar-2020,"As you may have learned over the weekend, public health officials have announced that there is a confirmed case of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) involving an Alameda County resident. It is linked to the recent case in Solano County and does not represent local transmission.

At this time, we have no confirmed cases of the virus on campus and we continue to take appropriate actions to prepare for any possible case here. Above all, we are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our campus community. We understand and empathize with the anxiety many are feeling about the novel coronavirus and we are committed to providing regular updates.

For more updates
The latest information on how UC Berkeley is responding to coronavirus

Today, campus officials have activated our Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which will allow for operational leaders from across campus units to meet, share information and develop contingency plans in a more efficient and coordinated manner. This is in addition to the ongoing meetings of senior campus leadership (the Crisis Management Team) that began two months ago. Campus health officials are in close contact with and will continue to take guidance from local public health officials at the city, county, state, and federal levels. The UC Office of the President provides additional operational guidance.

Other developments regarding the virus include an expansion of countries that now have travel advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. We encourage everyone to view the continually updated information on travel which is posted on the campus Global Engagement website.



We encourage students to review this preparation checklist to help with planning for possible disruptions to instruction. This includes guidance such as asking instructors what their plans are for disruptions and being ready to engage more heavily via bCourses, Zoom or other alternate instructional tools. Campus academic leadership sent a message to instructors today advising them to make preparations in the event in-person instruction is disrupted.

Please continue to visit the University Health Services web page for the latest and more detailed information regarding the virus, campus actions and general tips on how to stay safe.

Meanwhile, we continue to remind you to wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, cover and contain any coughs into a tissue or your sleeve, avoid touching your face, and please stay home if you feel sick.",408,cal,3
Berkeley,28-Feb-2020,"There have been a number of new and significant developments regarding the novel coronavirus(COVID-19), consequently we are writing to you today to share the latest information and guidance with you.

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the virus on campus or in Alameda County. We remain vigilant in our campus prevention and response efforts, which have been underway for months now, and are ready to take prompt and effective action should a case occur here.

Recent developments regarding the virus include the announcement by public health officials this week of a new and troubling confirmed coronavirus case in Solano County; news of notable spread of the disease in more countries; and a warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that Americans should expect to see more cases here including the possibility of the virus spreading in some communities.  To prepare, local officials should review their pandemic plans, and everyone should follow the standard protocols of washing their hands frequently, not touching their face and staying home if sick.

Please keep in mind that while the potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States, the CDC states that the risk to the general American public, which is unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, is considered low. Still, we realize that this is a difficult time and we encourage the entire campus community to look out for one another.

New case in Solano county
The CDC and public health officials have announced that the new confirmed case in Solano County involves an individual who has not traveled to the impacted countries and has had no known contact with individuals with the virus. The individual is being treated at the UC Davis Medical Center.

Because this case is not connected with travel, it suggests that the virus may now be present in the U.S. community. As a result, public health professionals have today updated protocols for determining the criteria for testing individuals, have bolstered testing capacity at state and local laboratories, and are updating travel and other guidance daily.



On the Berkeley campus, we are proactively engaged in pandemic planning in collaboration with our public health partners: this includes everything from intentional use and preservation of essential medical supplies and staffing resources, to enhancing protocols and coordinating efforts to isolate sick and quarantine at-risk individuals. This is in addition to ongoing efforts that include campus leaders meeting at least weekly to develop and review plans regarding best practices such as where and how to house individuals if a case occurs; how to ensure we will meet teaching obligations if there are a number of cases on campus; and how to assist and support international students, researchers and other potentially impacted members of our campus community.

Campus officials are also working in coordination with the University of California, Office of the President, which activated its Emergency Operations Center many weeks ago and continues to hold regular conference calls including medical, environmental health and safety, administrative, and emergency management leadership from across the UC system.

Spread of the disease in more countries
There have been a number of news reports of the virus’s growing impact in other countries including Italy and South Korea. UC President Janet Napolitano recently updated her systemwide directive regarding travel to advise the UC community to temporarily avoid all nonessential travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Travel Warning – Level 3 Notice (avoid nonessential travel). Note that the CDC travel warning is distinct from the State Department travel advisories.  The systemwide directive currently includes South Korea as well as China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Macau an d Hong Kong).



We would in addition strongly recommend that everyone carefully review both the CDC website and the State Department website in planning for upcoming personal travel: additional hot spots are likely to emerge and in addition to the risk of exposure while abroad, there is a risk that border controls similar to those currently in place for China may be put in place by the U.S. Government and it could be challenging to return.

The Berkeley campus has a process in place by which members of the campus community may seek exemptions for university-related travel. We also encourage everyone who travels, whether for university business or for personal travel, to register with the campus travel service, which provides additional protections and safety measures.



Please continue to refer to the University Health Services’ advisory page, which is updated weekly or more frequently when needed.  Significant campus updates will be communicated through Cal Message and other means, as appropriate

And, once again, please continue to take care of yourselves and look out for each other as we work our way through these difficult times.",802,cal,2
Berkeley,31-Jan-2020,"News regarding the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues to evolve and we are writing today to keep you informed of the latest information from public health officials, governmental entities and others.

We learned today that there is one confirmed case of coronavirus in Santa Clara County. Currently, there remains no confirmed cases in Alameda County. And, as you are aware, there are a number of other cases in the United States and thousands in China.

[Earlier: How UC Berkeley is preparing for coronavirus]

Regarding travel, the State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory (do not travel) for China and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to China. University of California President Janet Napolitano issued a directive Thursday requiring that UC limit non-essential UC-related travel to China.

At UC Berkeley we are establishing local travel protocols to carry out the new UCOP travel directive. Please send any requests for essential UC-related travel to China to our Global Engagement Office (geo@berkeley.edu) for review and approval.

For the latest information and more details about recent developments please continue to view the UHS Health Advisory. We also strongly encourage all members of the campus community to register with the campus travel insurance program for both personal and professional travel as doing so provides a number of measures to help ensure your safety.

While the CDC informs us that the risk of the virus to the U.S. general population is low, we understand that these can be anxious and stressful times. We encourage all members of the campus community to support each other, look out for each other, and keep in mind our Principles of Community. Remember, we are in flu season, so coming in contact with someone with a cough or fever does not necessarily indicate that they have coronavirus. Be mindful of your assumptions about others.

We will send another coronavirus update soon, meanwhile please continue to check the UHS website and news.berkeley.edu for updates.",332,cal,1
Berkeley,28-Jan-2020,"We are writing to provide an update on the coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and campus response and preparedness efforts.

University Health Services (UHS),working in partnership with local public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), continues to monitor the situation closely and take steps to help ensure the health and safety of the campus community.

There are several cases in the United States, including one in Santa Clara County and a few in Southern California. Most of the infections, thousands at this point, have occurred in China, including outside Wuhan, China.

While this coronavirus is understandably causing worry and anxiety, particularly in those returning from or with family in affected areas in China, the CDC currently believes the risk of the virus to the U.S. general public is low.

On campus, we are following all health protocols prescribed by the CDC and reinforced by state, county and city health officials. The CDC does not currently recommend isolation of travelers returning from affected areas if they do not have symptoms.  And as a community, we should be aware that this is an especially difficult time for Chinese students with family in the Wuhan area. To support the well-being of our students and the campus community, information and support resources may be helpful.

For individuals who recently returned from Wuhan, China please see our FAQ  for the latest health recommendations.

University Health Services officials have set up screening procedures for individuals who come to the Tang Center who are at high risk and are showing symptoms. Such individuals are moved immediately into a private room and evaluated in coordination with the public health department to see if they meet CDC criteria for testing and isolation. Senior campus leaders have been meeting to oversee and to help coordinate campus preparedness and response efforts. The UC Office of the President is also working to ensure close collaboration and communication among UC campuses.

Information and precautions for the general public
The best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the flu and other respiratory viruses are to:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Stay home when you are sick; if you must be out and about, consider wearing a paper (“surgical”) mask and avoid close contact with others.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then immediately throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, cough into your sleeve (not your hands).

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Academic Information
We are encouraging instructors to support students who have been advised to stay home, by helping them meet their academic obligations through alternatives to classroom-based learning. For students and instructors, details on policies for accommodations can be found here.

Davis,31-Jan-2020,"Fight it like the flu
Updated 5 p.m. Jan. 31 ? UC Davis continues to think locally and globally regarding the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and is spreading around the world.

INFLUENZA
Protecting yourself against the flu is protecting yourself from ?a real and present danger right now here at home,? UC Davis Health?s chief nursing and patient services officer, Toby Marsh, said in a memo to all staff late this afternoon (Jan. 31).

?An estimated 15 million people have been infected by the flu this season, with more than 8,000 deaths so far. In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.?

The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus ? the flu.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, ?person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.?

On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a ?very high threat? travel destination for university affiliates.

Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County?s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident ? a man ? had tested positive for the novel ? or new ? coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.

The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.

More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.

Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.

Travel advisory
With today?s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates? China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China ? and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.

Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.

Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs? COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.

Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs. 

The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.

The best defense
To help protect against flu virus ? and by extension, coronavirus ? Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.

UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.

Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: ?Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.?

Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. ?This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,? Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.

Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.

Schorzman?s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.

Human-to-human transmission
Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was ?not surprising, given what we know about the disease.?

MORE FROM UC DAVIS HEALTH
In a Jan. 24 news release and video, ?What U.S. Residents Should Know,? Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases, addresses such questions as, ?Should I wear a mask?? and ?What should I do if I have cold symptoms??
In a Jan. 22 news release and video, ?What You Should Know? (below), Blumberg addresses such questions as, ?Will the flu shot make a difference? and ?How can I avoid Wuhan coronavirus??
He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.

?That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,? Marsh said.

?It?s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.?

Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and ?determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.?

He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.

?I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,? he told staff. ?Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.?

Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was ?not surprising, given what we know about the disease.?

MORE FROM UC DAVIS HEALTH
In a Jan. 24 news release and video, ?What U.S. Residents Should Know,? Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases, addresses such questions as, ?Should I wear a mask?? and ?What should I do if I have cold symptoms??
In a Jan. 22 news release and video, ?What You Should Know? (below), Blumberg addresses such questions as, ?Will the flu shot make a difference? and ?How can I avoid Wuhan coronavirus??
He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.

?That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,? Marsh said.

?It?s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.?

Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and ?determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.?

He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.

?I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,? he told staff. ?Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.?

The 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a large family of viruses that are a common cause of mild upper respiratory infections, but also include both SARS and MERS, which can cause more serious disease. Most patients with coronavirus have mild symptoms, however this new virus has resulted in cases of severe illnesses and deaths reported in China.

To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

What is being done to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus?

To reduce further spread of the infection, Wuhan City and nearby areas have implemented travel restrictions. Airports in the US (including LAX), are now screening entering travelers from certain areas for symptoms of respiratory infection.

Locally, this is an evolving situation. The campus and medical center are in coordination with Orange County Health Care Agency resources and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) to provide ongoing clinical guidance.

Have there been any POSITIVE (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus cases on the UCI Campus?

No, we are informed there are currently no positive Coronavirus cases on the UCI campus or at the UCI Medical Center. Detailed information of confirmed cases in the U.S. can be found on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website as such information becomes available.

Is there a vaccine for Coronavirus, and can I be tested for Coronavirus if I feel unwell?

There is currently no vaccine for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working around the clock to develop one.

The only current testing for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is done at the CDC Laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia. At this point, testing is only performed for patients who meet all of the clinical and travel criteria.

What should I do if I think I have the Coronavirus? 

If you have a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath:

Stay Home from school/work if you are having symptoms 
Wash your hands and stay well hydrated/drinking fluids 
Cover your cough, and avoid close contact with others 
Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment 
If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, or have been in close contact with someone who has recently traveled to Wuhan, China, within 14 days before the onset of your symptoms, please notify your provider/clinic BEFORE entering their office. It is important to call so that your provider/clinic can be prepared for your visit.

The UCI Student Health Center has developed triage screening (by phone and at our front desks) and has implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff.

UCI Students should call Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304.

UCI Faculty and Staff should call their healthcare provider immediately for care.

What can I do to help keep from getting the Coronavirus, or other infections?

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school
Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food
If you have not received your annual flu shot, please visit the UCI SHC website to review the schedule, and schedule a Flu Shot visit
Do face masks protect against coronavirus? Do I need one?

For now, public health officials say thereÕs no need to wear face masks in the United States; however, there is likely no harm in adding this additional layer of prevention, especially for people who think they may be sick.

Health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases will follow CDC recommendations to wear the N95 respirator mask, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors.

How will I know if things change/there are any cases at UCI?

The UCI Student Health Center will continue to screen and identify possible cases of Coronavirus. We are committed to providing optimal care for those with symptoms, and to helping ensure appropriate treatment and exposure prevention. As the situation changes and we have new information, we will send timely updates to the campus community.",975,cal,1

Irvine,29-Jan-2020,"Dear Anteaters, 

We want to provide you this midweek update to address the latest information on Coronavirus and UCI operations, as well as to quell some of the rumors that are traveling through campus. As was noted in the campus zotmail dated January 26, there was a positive case of the Novel Wuhan Coronavirus identified in Orange County. That individual is recovering in isolation, and has no affiliation with UCI.

UCI continues to operate normally, classes are not cancelled and the campus is not closed. Additionally, all ancillary activities such as seminars, athletic competitions, performances, and events continue to proceed as scheduled. Students should plan to continue attending classes and participating in campus activities. 

You will soon see reminders around campus as we prepare to launch a poster campaign to maintain vigilance within the Anteater community during this time of progressing information. As a preventative measure, campus facilities and custodial are increasing the frequency for wiping down common areas and using disinfectant, as well.

Since the last email update to campus, a website was created to house all updates related to Coronavirus and UCI operations. We invite you to visit: https://ehs.uci.edu/PublicHealth/coronavirus.html. On this website are two sets of FAQs: one for students and one for faculty and staff. You can find the buttons for the FAQs on the right side of the screen. Please check back to this page often as we are continuing to post updates as information about Coronavirus evolves.

Additionally, please listen to this UCI podcast where I talk candidly about the common questions students are asking both on campus and in social media. Here you can learn the latest information on face masks, and the symptoms and criteria for Coronavirus, as well as addressing the anxieties and fears students are expressing.

We continue to work with the Orange County Health Care Agency and medical center leadership to evaluate the situation in Orange County, and we will share updates by email, social media, and on both the Student Health Center and Public Health websites. And, we continue to follow the guidance of the Center for Disease Control.

Please remember to stay healthy by washing your hands with soap and water frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep.

Thank you for your cooperation in protecting the UCI community.

Irvine,31-Jan-2020,"Dear Anteaters, 

As the week comes to an end, I want to provide an update on the novel Coronavirus:

There are currently NO UCI students, staff, or faculty identified by the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) as ÒPersons Under InvestigationÓ for the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus.
There are NO NEW positive cases identified in Orange County.
UCI leadership have been meeting daily to discuss developments and keep our campus informed and safe. We are also working closely with the OCHCA and the UC system. We continue to follow Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance and have not been directed to quarantine or isolate students, staff, or faculty who have had recent travel to China.

The CDC continues to enforce the proactive screening of new travelers from high-risk areas as they enter the United States at major airports. These travelers are screened for symptoms, and depending on findings, may be advised on infection precautions, or tested and possibly isolated prior to returning to their home/work/school.

Masks 
UCI is following the counsel of both the CDC and the University of California, which advises that available masks are for ill patients only, who we advise should stay home and recover before returning to classes.

Use of the specialized N95 masks is primarily designated for staff who have the highest potential contact with potentially sick individuals, such as healthcare providers and first responders.

Feelings of Concern 
We are all aware of the anxiety that comes from the unknown, and there are still many unknowns about the Coronavirus. We have resources for our students who are feeling stressed and we encourage them to contact the UCI Counseling Center for support. Staff and faculty who are feeling anxious should contact the Employee Assistance Program.

The campus has launched a campaign this week with wellness ambassadors to bring awareness to best practices for staying healthy Ð physically and mentally. Ambassadors are also able to answer your questions regarding what is currently known about the Coronavirus, influenza, and the common cold. 

As always, remember to wash your hands with soap and water frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep. Thank you for your cooperation in protecting the UCI community.

Irvine,3-Feb-2020,"Dear Campus Community,
On Jan. 30, 2020, University of California President Janet Napolitano directed the UC community to temporarily Òavoid all non-essential travelÓ to China. As a result of this directive, the campus and medical center have developed a process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential, or if it can be postponed.

UCI faculty, staff, and students should also be aware that on Jan. 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 alert, its most severe warning, stating Òdo not travel to China due to the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus.Ó In addition, commercial airline carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China making travel difficult.

UC restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal, but such travelers should be aware of travel risks, and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.

Approval Process Prior to Travel

As result of President NapolitanoÕs directive, all non-essential travel to China is now restricted until further notice. All travelers who would like to engage in essential travel to China (defined in the following categories) must obtain prior approval as follows:

The UCI campus has an existing travel approval policy and process that applies to students. This policy and process are being temporarily extended to include faculty and staff travel to China.

The Policy for Student International Activities Ð http://www.policies.uci.edu/policies/pols/420-10.php Ð includes a review process by the UCI International Risk Review Team which will temporarily include representation from UCI Health and the Academic Senate, as this policy is being extended to include faculty.

During this time, anyone who believes their travel to China is essential should contact the UCI International Risk Review Team to request review and approval before travel. Please email global@uci.edu to request a review.

As directed by President Napolitano, it is of the utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for university-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry https:/ehs.ucop.edu/away before their expected departure. This information must be kept up-to-date as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keep the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as coronavirus.

Irvine,4-Feb-2020,"Dear Instructors, 

We ask that you refrain from requiring written excuses from medical personnel for absence due to illness. Many healthy people experience a mild-to-moderate illness and recover without the need to seek medical attention.

The UCI Student Health Center does not have the capacity to evaluate such illnesses and provide documentation excusing student absences. However, our providers will continue to provide documentation when a student is being treated by the Student Health Center for an illness that necessitates a change in course load or an incomplete.

From time-to-time the Academic Senate has issued guidance concerning missed classes and exams due to illnesses such as influenza advising that students not attend class if they have a fever. Should a student experience repeated absences due to illness, it may be appropriate for the faculty member to ask the student to seek medical advice or consult with Disability Services Center for temporary accommodations. 

The Senate guidelines advise faculty to use flexibility and good judgment in determining whether to excuse missed work, extend deadlines, or substitute an alternative assignment. Only the Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI) can waive the final exam. However, a department chair can authorize an instructor to offer an alternative format for a final exam (e.g., paper, take-home exam) on a one-time basis.

Thank you for your valuable time and attention.

Irvine,14-Feb-2020,"The Coronavirus pandemic is a global event affecting more than 25 countries. As you have read in recent campus messages from Dr. Albert Chang, medical director of the Student Health Center, there is still much that is unknown clinically about the novel virus. Knowledge is critical in informing how we respond, and it is for this reason that researchers Ð at UCI and around the world Ð are actively engaged in understanding and containing this novel virus.

Campus leaders, faculty experts, and student ambassadors are striving to share evidence-based best practices from the Centers for Disease Control, continually updating our coronavirus information resources; broadening our public health education campaign; and partnering with local and county public health agencies. We are living in this moment together.

Underlying the unknowns of the virus itself are assumptions and fears rooted in the human condition of coping with misinformation and the desire to protect oneÕs health. I explore these factors in the most recent episode of the UCI Podcast on inclusivity during challenging times.

WhatÕs in a name?

As this pandemic has evolved over the past several weeks, so has the name and way in which we communicate about the novel Coronavirus. In its early days, the name of the city of Wuhan was used to describe the virus. The practice of associating a pathogen with a point of origin is shorthand for capturing a shifting and fast-moving process of discovery and transmission. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally adopted the acronym COVID-19. UCI has adopted this term. We will also use the term ÒCoronavirusÓ or Ònovel CoronavirusÓ in our communications.

What has come from this name change is an important lesson about the use of language in our multi-cultural world. Shorthand references to points of origin have unintentional cognitive impacts, such as triggering implicit biases and stereotypes. This practice can stigmatize an entire region. Among examples in the distant and recent past, include the ÒSpanish FluÓ in the 20th century and Ebola (a tributary of the Congo River in Central Republic of Africa) in recent memory. These terms are not only inaccurate but also reinforce groundless fears and stereotypes about regions in the world, not to mention the people who inhabit them; and others who immigrated or travelled to from the affected areas.

Correcting Course

The WHOÕs decision to adopt the acronym COVID-19 is an important step in focusing attention on the virus, and interrupting implicit assumptions and explicit stereotypes about the affected communities and individuals who travel to and from China. However, in the intervening time since news of the novel Coronavirus broke in January and WHOÕs official naming of the virus this week, Chinese and Chinese American communities have felt the impact of both unintentional and intentional biases and discrimination.

It is all of our individual responsibility to help shift this sentiment against a group of people and engage in dialogue based on accurate information about the Coronavirus and reject stereotypes and prejudice, whether on-line or in public. It is not enough to expect equity for ourselves but fail to advocate on behalf of others; to support diversity without understanding the diverse communities that make up our community; to practice inclusion without confronting bias and prejudice; and honor free speech without using it for advancing inclusive excellence.

At UCI, each person matters. ItÕs a commitment that extends beyond our campus borders to communities near and far. As Dr. Martin Luther King famously wrote Òwe are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied by a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.Ó By appreciating our diversity and practicing intentional inclusivity, we expand our individual capacity for intelligent empathy. Let us consider this insight in responding to global events in the local context.

Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion",638,cal,2
Irvine,25-Feb-2020,"Dear Anteaters:

We write to provide you an update on the COVID-19 outbreak and impacts as it pertains to our campus community. As you may have seen in the latest news coverage, COVID-19 has now spread to regions across the globe including Japan, South Korea, and Italy. Researchers at UCI and elsewhere continue to work around the clock to better understand and mitigate the impacts and transmission of this novel coronavirus.

While there are no current known cases in Orange County, it is important to keep in mind best practices for staying well and considering your risk of exposure to the virus through travel activity. This is critically important to keep in mind as spring break is around the corner and many students, faculty and staff are making plans to travel home or make other trips.

No matter where you travel, always know the status of your visa, and always have some emergency contacts. And, while there, you should also consult the website of the country you are visiting to see what policies are in place. Medical experts advise that the risk is low if you are traveling to a country where there are few or no cases of COVID-19. However, it is emphasized that you should evaluate your trip each day and look for any updates from the local authorities and from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Whether for university business or personal travel, let UCI know if you plan to travel anytime. The best way to do this is by registering your travel information at UC International Travel Registry even if you are a U.S. Citizen. Sharing your travel information allows us to have knowledge of your whereabouts should you be in an area of the world that sees an increase in COVID-19 cases such that your return home becomes compromised.

The details and guidance offered below reflect the current state of affairs and recommendations from the CDC and the U.S. Department of State. Please take care to read through them if you have any travel planned. Further below, we offer links to official resources and contact information should you need to connect with someone about your individual situation.

Closer to home, we ask that everyone continue to do their part in preserving a health community at UCI and prevent spreading illnesses, including the influenza which continues to be a bigger threat locally. Remember these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hand with soap and water
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough
Stay in your room if you are sick
Clean and disinfect surfaces often
The golden rule for travel is this: if you are the one who is sick, stay home, do not travel, and wear a mask, even for the flu.

Finally, as Doug Haynes, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion recently noted in a campus email and podcast on inclusion during difficult times, please be mindful of cultural and racial aspects of the present time, particularly with regard to the growing awareness of the threat of the novel coronavirus. UCI welcomes international scholars and values our partnerships around the world.

UC restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal, but such travelers should be aware of travel risks, and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.
Returning Travelers from Restricted Regions

CDC is advising returning travelers (during the past 14 days) from South Korea OR China AND who feel sick with fever or cough, or have difficulty breathing to:
Seek medical advice. Call ahead before you go to a doctorÕs office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
We understand that you may have made plans to travel to China and/or South Korea and booked your trip prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and that you may have family in these countries. Please note that if you travel to China or South Korea, and are respectively a Chinese or Korean national, it is not likely you will be let back into the United States.
For U.S. citizens and permanent residents, you will likely be expected to quarantine for 14 days upon your return. Whether you are under mandatory quarantine or self-quarantine, you will not be allowed back onto the UCI campus until after the quarantine ends. Be aware of how this may affect your attendance at classes, study groups, campus events Ð and ultimately your grades.
Stay Informed

To be the most informed before your journey, take a look at travel advisory information on these websites:
The website of the World Health Organization is a good place to start. There is a tab for Òtravel adviceÓ that posts regular updates on locations and how to best protect yourself while traveling. Check out their videos on the subject, too.
The U.S. State Department issues travel advisories for various countries, for many reasons, in addition to COVID-19.
The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has advised Americans to cancel all nonessential travel to China and South Korea, and also provides regular updates regarding other countries where there are cases of COVID-19.

IÕm writing to assure you that your health, well-being and academic excellence are our top priorities here at UCI. Since mid-January, a dedicated team on campus and at UCI Health has engaged daily in COVID-19 preparedness activities. The dynamic situation makes it challenging to predict what to expect as the virusÕs reach spreads.

We are staying current by operating in lockstep with recommendations from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Campus leaders are in constant contact with the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) and the UC Office of the President.

This preparedness work is no small task, but itÕs built on a great foundation developed from past epidemics such as the measles and SARS. Among the on-campus preparedness activities are:

Direct collaboration and partnership among campus, UCI Health and OCHCA to ensure aligned processes and clear communication
Support for students whose main residence is on campus and/or who are unable to return home for any reason during this impacted time. This includes:
A new patient intake and screening process to enhance identification and services at the Student Health Center
Quarantine and isolation plans for student campus housing
Alternative and remote course delivery methods
Identification of and outreach to students, faculty and staff who are abroad and may be in affected areas
Increased custodial services in large gathering areas such as lecture halls and dining facilities
Alternative work options and business continuity plans
Training of medical professionals and first responders on the screening of potentially exposed patients and the use of personal protective equipment
New practices for staff at the Employee Experience Center to manage questions based on individual situations
News reports and social media are raising anxiety levels in all of us. If you need help in managing the stress and concerns, know that the Counseling Center is open to all students, and employees may find guidance through the Employee Assistance Program. Together, we can ensure the peace of mind of our community.

For those who have travel plans during the upcoming spring break, please be sure to check the latest CDC travel guidelines and be aware of potential restrictions on your return. Bernadette Boden-Albala, dean of public health, recently recorded an informative podcast on traveling during difficult times.

Thank you for your continued commitment to observing these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough
Clean and disinfect surfaces often
If you are sick, stay home and do not travel
I am grateful to Dr. Albert Chang and Dr. Bill Wilson for their campus and medical center leadership, respectively, and dedication to our students, patients and community. We are fortunate to have world-class infectious disease and public health researchers at UCI and clinicians at UCI Health Ð all of whom are determined to mitigate the spread of this virus.

Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UCI at the COVID-19 webpage.

UC President Janet Napolitano has issued an amended travel directive based on the latest COVID-19 risk assessment from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). UC students, staff and faculty are to avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to CDC Level 2 countries, in addition to Level 3 countries. Currently:

CDC Level 3 Health Notice Countries are China, Iran, Italy and South Korea
CDC Level 2 Health Notice Countries: defined as those with Òsustained community transmissionÓ of COVID-19, includes just Japan, but please go to the CDC site for the most current information.
Further, individuals with a recent travel history from a CDC Level 3 country must self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left the Level 3 country and practice social distancing. CDC travel guidance for Level 3 countries applies to all travelers returning from a Level 3 country for any purpose, including personal travel. CDC is advising returning travelers from a Level 3 country who feel sick with fever or cough, or have difficulty breathing to:

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before you go to a doctorÕs office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
During this time, anyone who believes their travel to a Level 2 or 3 jurisdiction is essential should contact the UCI International Risk Review Team to request review and approval before travel. Please email global@uci.edu to request a review.

Whether for university business or personal travel, let UCI know if you plan to travel by registering your travel information at UC International Travel Registry. No matter where you travel, always know the status of your visa, and always have some emergency contacts. And, while there, you should also consult the website of the country you are visiting to see what policies are in place. It is emphasized that you should evaluate your trip each day and look for any updates from the local authorities and from the World Health Organization and CDC.

We understand that you may have made plans to travel and booked your trip prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and that you may have family in these countries. Please note that if you travel to a Level 3 risk country, and are a national of the respective countries, it is not likely you will be let back into the United States.

For U.S. citizens and permanent residents, you will likely be expected to quarantine for 14 days upon your return. Whether you are under mandatory quarantine or self-quarantine, you will not be allowed back onto the UCI campus until after the quarantine ends. Be aware of how this may affect your attendance at classes, study groups, campus events Ñ and ultimately your grades.

Additionally, please take into consideration these recommendations:

For domestic travelers: Use caution and judgment before any domestic travel, and check for the latest information from the county health care agency of your destination before your trip.
For large conferences and events:  We are following the guidance of health officials and there is currently no recommendation to avoid attending large conferences on campus. However, we still urge you to use caution and judgment if you decide to attend large conferences.
For incoming visitors to campus: Any visitor arriving to campus from a Level 3 jurisdiction must also follow the CDC guidelines to self-isolate off campus for 14 days since the date they left that country. This also applies to visitors who have been invited to campus on official university business.
For more tips about traveling at this time, visit the CDC Travel FAQ page.  Please also be sure to visit UCIÕs COVID-19 website often as new resources are being posted regularly.

Thank you for your continued cooperation in protecting the UCI community.

Irvine,6-Mar-2020,"Dear Middle Earth and Mesa Court Residents,

Among the proactive measures taken on campus to safeguard student health, UCI Dining has made a few changes that will reduce risk factors for contagion of coronavirus and other seasonal viruses. For example, you may notice in The Anteatery and Brandywine dining commons that self-serve stations, such as the salad bar, are now staffed with servers. There will also be two To-Go programs available for residents who prefer to eat their meals in their rooms or halls. And we will be increasing the frequency with which customer-facing areas such as dining tables, door handles, and food counters are wiped down.  There are no reported cases of corornavirus at UC Irvine, and our hope is that these preventive measures will reduce student concerns about potential exposure in group facilities. 

PeterÕs To-Go Meals

Residents may pick up a to-go boxed meal at the cashier station at the Anteatery or Brandywine during breakfast, lunch, and dinner for one meal swipe per to-go boxed meal. Each boxed meal will include a protein, vegetable, starch, dessert, fruit and a drink. Vegetarian and Vegan entrees will be available upon request. PeterÕs To-Go Meals may not be for dine-in. 

Reusable To-Go Container and Cup Program

Residents may visit the Anteatery or Brandywine and ask for a reusable to-go container and/or cup. For one meal swipe, residents can fill their reusable to go container with any items being served in our dining facilities to later enjoy in their rooms or halls. They can then return the dirty container or cup for a clean one or request a rain check card for future use. This reusable to-go program may not be for dine-in.

In addition to the to-go programs, Dining has also made a few other changes to the stations to help prevent the spread of viruses.

The Dining staff will be serving food at previous self-serve station to minimize the touching of tongs, serving spoons and ladles. Reusable cups and utensils will be provided at the cashier and food stations. Guests will be given a cup and utensils at the cashier station after they swipe in. Gloves will also be available upon request.
Signage will be posted at previous self-serve stations and throughout the dining facilities with these changes.
Dining staff will wipe down customer facing areas such as dining tables, door handles, food counters, sneeze guards, condiment bottles, etc. more frequently in all dining facilities. 
We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. Please direct any questions to our food services managers at the Anteatery and Brandywine or via email at food@uci.edu.

Irvine,8-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI community,

Since my last message, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has increased significantly across the U.S. We expect this number will continue to climb with more widespread testing. It is also reasonable to assume that, at some point, there will be a confirmed case within our region, and perhaps within our campus community. Understandably, these possibilities lead to elevated worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in higher-risk populations.

Campus Status 
The campus continues to remain open and is operating normally. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported at UCI, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully and assess the local impact with our partners from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Orange County Health Care Agency. 

After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend ordinary instructional activity. In-person classroom meetings will be under normal operation for the week of March 9th.

We are aware that a small number of other universities, with different local circumstances, have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our local situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the State Department of Public Health, Orange County officials, university health officials, and UC Office of the President.

While we are not ending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we do understand the value of increased Òsocial distancingÓ as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus. Today, in partnership with the Academic Senate, we are encouraging instructors to exercise flexibility and to adjust their course practices and policies to accommodate students who cannot attend in-person classes or take in-person finals during the remaining two weeks of the quarter.

Faculty have already begun planning to ensure that Spring instruction will proceed even if illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions prevent students or an instructor from coming to campus. If the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings. But that is not the situation we face at this time.

Operational Continuity 
As we consider future developments, faculty and staff should take steps to prepare for the possibility of a reduced campus operation, should that become necessary, including instruction, events, seminars, and other university business to be conducted fully online or remotely. 

While no decisions have been made yet to close large gatherings such as concerts, sporting events, conventions, or large community events, this remains a possibility for the future. As such, organizers should exercise key prevention strategies in your events operation plan.

Even if the campus needs to move to a hybrid or completely virtual instruction model, for planning purposes the campus community should assume that the campus will remain open in other ways. Additional details will be provided at the time, but we expect buildings will be open and faculty will have access to their offices, labs, and classroom facilities. On-campus housing will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases within on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials should it become necessary. Dining services in residence halls will also continue to serve students with meal plans.

Travel Considerations 
Additionally, students, faculty and staff should consider seriously whether personal travel is necessary at this time. If you are to leave for international travel now or at spring break, then you should understand there are real restrictions on getting back to the U.S., as well as the potential challenges of getting flights back home. Domestic travel is currently easier, but we are seeing a reduction in service in travel routes. While we can hope that transportation hubs will remain open, we cannot predict that will be the case upon your return to campus. 

Travel restrictions will become stricter as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase and high-risk Level 2-3 regions are identified. Whether you travel abroad or locally, you should be prepared to arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return should you return from a restricted jurisdiction (International or Domestic) or are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID-19. Other unanticipated restrictions may apply as public health officials monitor the situation.

Your Health & Wellness 
Should you need support to manage this difficult time, the Counseling Center is open to all students, and employees may find guidance through the Employee Assistance Program.

As a reminder, we recommend observing these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Stop touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Instead of shaking hands, find alternate ways to greet people.
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough.
Clean and disinfect surfaces often.
If you are sick, stay home and do not travel. 
Call ahead before visiting your doctor or the Student Health Center to arrange a time to be seen.
Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UCI at the COVID-19 webpage. We will continue to make regular updates to FAQs and details about modified campus operations as new information is available.

I remain committed to ensuring that UCI delivers a world-class education while prioritizing the health and safety of our community. Thank you for doing your part to protect our community.",951,cal,3
Irvine,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Anteaters,

UCI has learned that we now have a member of our campus community who is considered a person under investigation (PUI) for potentially testing positive for COVID-19. This individual was seen by the Student Health Center, where their arrival was coordinated to avoid exposure to others and where they could be safely tested for COVID-19. The test was sent to the Orange County Health Care Agency, and we should know the results within 36 hours. This individual is now under self-quarantine off campus until we learn the results. 

As a continued commitment to the health of our campus, we have been screening, testing and following up on all cases that meet criteria. We currently have several cases that we are following very closely with the Orange County Health Care Agency, and we will be sure to inform our community of any updates and changes.

In addition to partnering with the County for COVID-19 preparedness and testing, UCI has contracted with Quest for increased testing ability. Through this level of increased testing, we will be able to expand the number of tests we will be able to perform, which will help us manage our resources. 

While we have increased capability for testing, please remember there are still specific criteria we consider prior to testing for COVID-19. Students who feel that they have been exposed or are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should call the Student Health Center/or your physicianÕs office for further guidance. Staff and faculty should contact their primary care provider or call ahead to an urgent care center before arriving in person.

If you feel ill or think that you qualify for testing, contact your provider BEFORE going into the clinic. And please consider using Live Health Online, a newly offered USHIP covered service that connects you via a TELE-MEDICINE visit with a provider online, from the convenience of your home, 24 hours a day. See the details here:https://shc.uci.edu/services/livehealth-online

Also note that, effective March 9, 2020, UC SHIP will reduce the student cost share to $0 for all medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with directives issued last week by the CA Department of Managed Care and the CA Department of Insurance. Cost sharing includes, but is not limited to, copays, deductibles or coinsurance. Medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19 may include hospital (including emergency department), urgent care visits, provider office visits and/or telehealth encounters (e.g., LiveHealth Online) where the purpose of the visit is to be screened and/or tested for COVID-19. 

For students who qualify based on the criteria above, and if those students pay out of pocket costs related to COVID-19 services to hospitals, urgent care centers, LiveHealth Online or other providers, Anthem will reimburse the student (i.e., copay, coinsurance). The student can reach out to Anthem directly or they may contact the Student Health Center Billing or Insurance Departments for assistance in obtaining reimbursement.

For students who have health insurance coverage other than UC SHIP, we encourage you to contact your insurance carrier directly for information related to your benefits and out-of-pocket costs associated with COVID-19 services. While LiveHealth Online is available to all registered students, those students who have health insurance other than UC SHIP may have a tele-health option available to them through their own health insurance plan.

We continue to encourage students to be healthy and to refrain from attending classes if they are unwell. And if you are feeling ill, you may contact your professors directly, or you may complete an Intake Form at the Disability Services Center to request accommodations for any clinically approved extended absences. https://dsc.uci.edu/register/

We realize this is a stressful time and many of you are feeling anxious. Everyone should continue to follow the guidance for regular handwashing with soap, getting plenty of sleep, eating healthy, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, along with adhering to the new guidance for social distancing Ð or keeping several feet of space between yourself and those around you in public, when feasible.

Please do not hesitate to call the Student Health Center or your physician if you would like to arrange a medical visit, and explore the Live Health Online option for a virtual visit. And please refer to the COVID-19 webpage for UCI information and updates.

We will send out another campus update when test results are received.

Irvine,10-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI community,

With finals week just around the corner and the uncertainty of the impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hovering, I write to share definitive actions that the campus is taking effective immediately, and until further notice.

These decisions are made in support of the concept of Òsocial distancing,Ó which is a public health concept to reduce the probability of contact between individuals who are or may be carrying a highly contagious disease. Social distancing Ð which can be effective with as little as a six-feet gap between individuals Ð helps to prevent infections that are transmitted by droplet (such as coughing, sneezing or touching a contaminated surface). Science shows that reducing the concentration of people in an area can lower the infection risk for everyone involved. The following actions are designed to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings.

Academic Instruction

As I mentioned in my March 8 message, while instruction for this week continues to take place in person, instructors are directed to exercise flexibility and to adjust their course practices and policies to accommodate students who cannot attend in-person classes over the next few days.
Final exams next week will be administered remotely. Departments and instructors should work together to determine the most appropriate solutions for finishing courses and assigning grades, putting student health and success first in their decision making. 
We are transitioning to a remote learning mode for Spring quarter. In limited cases, such as courses involving a lab, studio instruction, or clinical experiences, instructors will need to make accommodations to meet the course requirements whether in person or via an alternative delivery mode. Deans and department chairs will communicate these exceptions by the end of the week after consulting with the provost office. Otherwise, students will be able to receive instruction through distance learning options. 
Graduate students will transition to remote work whenever possible and may also continue work in research labs after consulting with their faculty and departments. Instructional tools and classrooms remain available for hosting online meetings, seminars, and course development. Access to research spaces and other resources necessary for graduate work will continue.
Students living on campus are strongly encouraged to return to their off-campus residences and, if possible, and to stay at home during the Spring quarter. As described above, Winter quarter final exams and Spring quarter instruction will be available to students living remotely. Students who remain in on-campus housing for the Spring will also receive instruction remotely and should be prepared for reduced on-campus activities and interactions. Dining services will remain open, with modified service options. The Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs will offer guidance on student services and housing in a separate message tomorrow and will create a process for identifying students who wish to move off campus for the remainder of the academic year.
UCI Health remains fully operational. Employees should follow guidance sent from medical center leadership. Students, residents, fellows and faculty members in the schools of the Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences will be receiving discipline-specific guidance.
Campus Events & Visits

All events and gatherings with more than 100 participants are to be canceled. Where possible, you are encouraged to deliver the event in an alternative format. For campus events that continue as scheduled, it is advised that organizers exercise key prevention strategies in event operation plans. Gatherings of less than 100 may also be inconsistent with the practice of social distancing if not properly organized.
Departments should not require visiting scholars and recruited faculty or graduate students to attend in-person meetings on campus. Necessary interviews and presentations should be done remotely.
All UCI Athletics events and competitions will continue as closed events. As such there will be no spectators or fans at these events.
Business Continuity

Importantly, the campus is not closing. Campus offices will remain open and most operations will continue. Employees who need to work remotely should contact supervisors for approval. Guidance for supervisors is forthcoming from Human Resources.
UCI is restricting all non-essential University-sponsored travel Ð international or domestic, particularly by air or train. Any UCI sponsored travel will require a vice chancellor, dean or chief officer approval. You are encouraged to find alternate means of conducting business as we work to help limit the potential spread of infection to other areas.
Office of Research has developed guidelines for assumptions in continuity planning that include reduction in available personnel, handling of experiments and data, and research management support. Guidance and information is forthcoming.
Understandably, there will be many questions in the days ahead. We are all committed to getting you timely information quickly, and with as much clarity as possible. However, I recognize that no number of messages or FAQs can answer every question, especially those with uniquely individual circumstances. We have established the UCI Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response Center. Students, staff, faculty, parents, and community partners may call 949-824-9918 or email covid19@uci.edu to connect directly for more information.

While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the UCI community at this time, those with symptoms, especially if they have visited high-risk areas, are encouraged to call their medical providers or the Student Health Center. I encourage you to revisit our previous communications and tips for staying well on the COVID-19 updates webpage.

Thank you for your commitment to a healthy UCI community. Please remember to stay well and look out for each other.",920,cal,3
Irvine,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Anteaters,

Since my last communication with you, we have received good news. The Orange County Health Care Agency informed us that the person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 tested negative. 

The Student Health Center has received a number of inquiries asking for information about the movement of the individual who was under investigation. In this weekÕs case, the campus quickly identified where the PUI had been and notified those individuals who were in close proximity with them, including classmates. Should we have any further cases of PUIs at UCI, we will be practicing the same outreach measures to ensure those that are most likely to be at risk are aware of the details and counseled on proper actions to take in order to minimize spreading the virus responsible for COVID-19.

As a reminder, if students feel ill or that you meet specific criteria for testing, please call the Student Health Center or physicianÕs office for further guidance. Students may also consider using LiveHealth Online, from the convenience of your home, 24 hours a day. Staff and faculty should contact their primary care provider or call ahead to an urgent care center before arriving in person.

Irvine,11-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

As faculty prepare to deliver more instruction online, this is a good time to review our university policies concerning ownership of course materials and some steps faculty can take to protect them. 

The University of CaliforniaÕs 2003 policy on Ownership of Course Materials describes in detail ownership of course materials in whatever medium or combination thereof and includes, but is not limited to, lectures, lecture notes and materials, syllabi, study guides, and web-ready content. In brief, unless you have used Òexceptional university resourcesÓ to create course materials, you own the copyrights to the course materials you create. This means that only the faculty member and anyone to whom the faculty member has granted permission may reproduce, distribute, or display course materials. 

Rules relating to the distribution of course recordings are described in the University of CaliforniaÕs 2005 policy on Use of Recordings of Course Presentations. In sum, only legitimate pedagogical and instructional uses by enrolled students and by faculty are allowed.

For more details on these topics and about how to protect your materials, please see DTEIÕs Guidance for UCI Faculty in Light of Increased Online Instruction (COVID-19).

As the campus responds in real time to the coronavirus threat, we wanted to reach out and thank you for the amazing level of understanding you have displayed. We know that the new procedures regarding social distancing are impacting many aspects of your daily lives, and we want to assure you that maintaining a high quality of education is our top priority.

At this point, there are some concrete steps you can take to prepare for final exams. First, I want to emphasize that the campus is covering the costs for remote proctoring for Examity and Respondus. Faculty have received these instructions as well. Please go to this link to confirm you have the correct equipment, additional options will be available if you do not. This is a live document and will be regularly updated, so please check back regularly. Second, and most importantly, make sure you have clarity on your instructorÕs plan, because each instructor is in charge of her or his own course. Finally, courses are likely to use remote proctoring. We have created a landing page that will point you to a wide set of resources here. Technical information about resources for remote exams and instruction are available at: https://techprep.oit.uci.edu/learning/. If you do not have proper resources, please reach out to your instructor as soon as possible so we can ensure the correct resources are in place.

In preparation for the spring quarter, know that we are offering the full spectrum of courses. As you plan for Spring quarter, make sure to reach out to instructors if you have any questions. It is critical to check with faculty about the tools/modes they will use to ensure you will be able to engage fully in the course. Many courses will be using either Zoom or Yuja to deliver remote content. Please familiarize yourself with any instructions for use of these tools (start here for information). Information on accommodating students who do not have access to these tools will be available soon.

As your instructors decide on new ways to administer final exams and to deliver spring courses in a remote format, we hope that youÕll continue to be flexible and patient. Instructors are working to address these challenges in real time, and best health practices are our current top priority.  Please consider that there are many logistical challenges to overcome and that no alternative is perfect. If you feel, however, that there are issues that your instructor may not have considered, feel free to reach out to them in a respectful manner or contact the Student Affairs Office in your School.

In summary, here is the regularly updated document with course/instruction related resources for students.

Yours,",451,cal,3
Irvine,12-Mar-2020,"A key component of the campus social distancing, remote teaching, and telework strategy is using the powerful remote meeting tool Zoom. Zoom can be used to host and attend remote instruction, hold meetings, and collaborate digitally with colleagues, classmates, and friends. Zoom can be used on any computer, tablet, or mobile phone.

We would like to announce the immediate availability of Zoom enterprise licensing for all UCI faculty, staff, and students. Zoom meetings will allow up to 300 attendees per session over an unlimited number of minutes. You can facilitate interactive meetings in real-time, video chat, create polls, screen share, and share documents. Live sessions can also be recorded and distributed to enable access by participants who are unable to attend live sessions.

General Campus
You can sign up for Zoom by visiting https://uci.zoom.us and signing in with your UCInetID and password. A quick start guide for basic functionality is hosted by Zoom. If you already have an existing account you will be asked if you want to migrate it. It is safe to do, all your data will be migrated to the campus instance and your old account closed. If you are a main campus faculty member who is seeking to leverage Zoom for your course, please visit the UCI Pedagogical Continuity webpage or review the tips hosted by the Paul Merage School of Business.

Irvine,12-Mar-2020,"EVENT POLICIES AMENDMENT COVID-19
Effective March 12 Ð June 30, 2020

This is an amendment to the following UCI policies and procedures:

Sec. 900-15: UCI Major Events Policy,
Sec. 900-10: Policy on Use and Scheduling of UC Irvine Properties, and
Sec. 900-11: Guidelines for Scheduling Campus Properties through Student Center & Event Services,
which all implement PACAOS 40.00 Policy on Use of University Properties.

This policy applies to all UCI faculty, staff, students, residents, fellows, volunteers, visitors and contractors.

A. Policy

UCI should consider conducting business (gatherings of any size) using alternate methods (for example, virtual events.)
Social distancing should be practiced at all times.
Events with anticipated attendance of 100 or more must be canceled to reduce the risk of potential spread of infection.
Reservations may not be accepted for events with 100 or more participants for dates on or before June 12, 2020.
Reservations for events with 100 or more participants for dates between June 13, 2020 and September 27, 2020 must include a provision allowing the University, at its sole discretion, to terminate or cancel the reservation.
B. Policy Exceptions

If you believe your event of 100 people or more merits an exception to this policy, consult with Environmental Health & Safety.
¥ Initiate your inquiry by completing the UC Irvine COVID-19 Registration of University Events form.
_ Include an explanation of why the event is necessary and the consequence of not having or not attending the event.
EH&S will work with you to assess the risks from a public health perspective.
Any exceptions to this policy must be obtained prior to the event and documented.
Only deans, vice chancellors, or associate chancellors may approve such exceptions.
If exceptional approval is granted, social distancing should be practiced. Additionally, extraordinary venue cleaning will be required during and after the event. These additional cleaning services will be determined during the EH&S assessment. Such services may include items such as having dedicated Facilities Management staff to provide supplemental cleaning during the event.
C. Cancelled Events

Impacts of cancelled events can be substantial. It is important to document all costs of cancelled events including loss of (anticipated) revenue, fees/costs associated with rebooking and cancellations, broken contracts, MOUÕs, and other event obligations. Cost impacts of cancelled events should be recorded with supporting documentation by the event organizers. These records should be kept locally for possible future reimbursement, though such reimbursement cannot be guaranteed.",401,cal,3
Irvine,13-Mar-2020,"Dear Students, Parents and Families,

The administration, faculty and staff at UCI are working diligently to ensure continuity of education while protecting the health and welfare of our community. Today, we are writing to acknowledge the many questions and concerns about final exams and the determination of grades for winter quarter. We recognize that the lack of concrete information can be frustrating. Please know that we are doing everything we can to provide students the resources and support they need to provide as smooth a conclusion to the winter quarter as possible. 

Next week, we will be administering final exams remotely, with reliable proctoring software or other similarly secure mechanisms that safeguards the integrity of the process. Faculty have a considerable amount of discretion in their choice of alternative methods of assessment. Given this, final assignments may be given in a variety of ways. Students should be on the lookout for instructions on final exams and alternative final assignments from their instructors.

Only individual faculty members have the requisite information about their classes, their students, and about how assessment has taken place during the rest of the quarter. Given the rapidly evolving situation, please understand that faculty are working to make these adjustments as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience as the campus works diligently to provide students with the resources and information they need during this time. Maintaining the fairness and accuracy of grades is essential, and we are committed to a manner of alternative course and exam delivery that is fully in keeping with our academic and instructional mission. 

We will be communicating regularly so that you have the most up-to-date information about campus operations. Please know that a housing and dining fee message is coming soon from UCI's Student Affairs division.

Irvine,13-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Students,

I am writing as a follow-up to Chancellor GillmanÕs email sent on March 10, 2020 regarding the change in campus operations to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to our UCI community. As the Chancellor mentioned in his message, the efforts we are undertaking are based on our concern for the publicÕs health and safety. We do not take these changes lightly and appreciate your understanding as we navigate this evolving environment.

Student Housing and Meal Plans
Students in all campus housing, including the American Campus Communities, are strongly encouraged to go to their permanent residence if they are able. If you are a financial aid recipient and decide to leave campus, federal law requires us to change your financial aid award.

For students that decide not to continue their room & board or rental agreements for Spring Quarter 2020, there will be no penalty to cancel your lease. A separate message to lease holders will be sent with instructions on informing us of your decision. You will need to inform us of your decision to continue or cancel your lease by Wednesday, March 18, 2020, at 5 p.m. PDT.

Student Life
All events and student activities scheduled on campus with 100 or more attendees are cancelled until further notice. If an event is less than 100 attendees, event organizers are strongly encouraged to deliver the event in an alternative format. It is also important to note that gatherings of less than 100 attendees may also be inconsistent with the practice of social distancing if not properly organized. Therefore, we strongly encourage that all events, even those with less than 100 attendees, be delivered in an alternative format and, if not possible, canceled or postponed.

The UCI Student Center and Anteater Recreation Center remain open at this time. Student services such as the UCI Counseling Center, UCI Student Health Center, Disability Services Center, and FRESH Basic Needs Hub remain open to support students, but will be reassessed in early spring. While campus services remain open, students should know that offices may implement procedures to minimize contact, such as providing services remotely. We recommend that students visit their websites first for information on accessing services.

UCI Commencement
We are saddened to share that the UCI Commencement Ceremonies will not take place in the same way as previous years. We advise families not to make arrangements to come to the campus for the Commencement celebrations. We are actively looking at alternatives to celebrate our graduates in an appropriate manner. We understand that commencement is an important part of the UCI experience and we want to honor our students while still keeping our community safe. Graduating students should look for a separate message from the UCI Commencement office with details and information in the coming weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.

The move to remotely-delivered final examinations for Winter Quarter and remote teaching for Spring Quarter means that the need for timely Canvas support is more critical than ever. Traditionally, these questions have been answered by local OIT staff during regular business hours. To meet this unprecedented demand, IÕm happy to announce that faculty and teaching assistants can now get help 24/7, 365 days a year, starting now. Instructure (the makers of Canvas), will be providing support directly via phone, email, and live text chat. Going forward, all Canvas-related questions from faculty and teaching assistants should be directed here:

Canvas Support Hotline: 855-213-7130
support@instructure.com
Live Text Chat
OIT staff will continue to field questions about homegrown EEE+ tools, including GrandCentral, where you create your Canvas course spaces, add teaching assistants, and provide access for waitlisted students. OIT will also continue to support Canvas for students and staff. Their hours are 8AM-5PM Monday-Friday and they can be reached at eee-support@uci.edu.

To assist UCIÕs research community with keeping informed about evolving circumstances, emerging guidance and information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on UCIÕs research enterprise, the Office of Research (OR) has launched a Research Continuity website.  This resource is intended to be a location where researchers and their support staff can go to get answers to their questions.  Given that circumstances are very fluid at this point, the website and its contents are living documents, and will be updated regularly.  Therefore, I strongly encourage you to refer to this website often.

I am also writing to inform you that OR has developed Human Research Continuity guidance, which is available on the Research Continuity website.  This information includes the status of IRB/HRPP operations, operational priorities, and guidance on COVID-19 screening of research subjects prior to study appointments.  It also clarifies that practicing social distancing practices used in lieu of in-person interactions does not require an IRB approved modification prior to implementation.  This guidance also includes important general guidance for clinical research.

OR is committed to providing the UCI research community with important information and developments regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UCI research through regular messaging and the Research Continuity website.  Please direct any questions regarding ORÕs continuity plans to Bruce Morgan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Administration at bruce.morgan@uci.edu or 949-824-5677.  Questions regarding ULARÕs continuity plan should be directed to Claire Lindsell at claire.lindsell@uci.edu or 949-824-0569.

Irvine,16-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Students,

We are writing to follow up on our announcement regarding the status of the 2020 Commencement Ceremonies. As we mentioned in our campuswide email on March 13, we are saddened by the decision to cancel the ceremonies for the graduating class of 2020. In consultation with public health experts and given the serious health concerns, we could not risk the safety and security of our students, parents and families. While some may believe that Coronavirus and resulting COVID_19 disease will subside in a few months, given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus, the risk is too great to the community to assemble large gatherings such as UCI Commencement.

We are in the process of exploring two alternatives at this time. One possibility is a virtual ceremony. This idea is still in early development but updates will be provided in the coming weeks. In place of the June Commencement program, we are beginning our planning to hold in_person Commencement Ceremonies during the Winter 2020 recess that occurs mid-December 2020. This plan is contingent on our public health status at that time. Please keep in mind that there is still a possibility that we would not be able to hold the program.

We understand that the Commencement experience is about celebrating with family and loved ones a significant milestone in your personal and academic development. While the formal pomp and circumstance will not take place in June, we hope that we can create an experience that honors the commitment and sacrifice made by you and your family. We ask for your patience and understanding as we continue to find solutions during these unprecedented times.

Irvine,17-Mar-2020,"Dear Cove Friends,

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate this health crisis. The last few days have remarkably changed the way we do business and engage as a community. The Cove Ð designed to be a collaborative and public gathering space Ð has closed its public operations out of an abundance of caution and in line with current best practices for public spaces. We expect to reopen on April 6, 2020.

All programming in the Cove is suspended and on-site services will not be available. Our diligent Beall Applied Innovation team is now online and working from home, available to offer support and information via phone or video meeting. We have asked our Wayfinder startup teams and Cove partner tenants to also work remotely.

UCIÕs priority remains the health and welfare of the campus and community members at large and the CoveÕs actions are similar to our schools and research centers. For the most current campus updates and other resources, you can visit uci.edu/coronavirus. This website is refreshed throughout each day.

WeÕre all adjusting to what is hopefully a very short-term Ònew normalÓ. Our efforts to support the modern American Dream and regional economic vitality will be needed more than ever once this moment passes. Though we may be practicing social distancing, we look forward to remaining digitally connected for now, continuing our work of fueling new innovations and opportunities. Thank you for your continued support.
 

Stay Healthy,

Irvine,17-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues:

The COVID-19 crisis and the rapidly-changing circumstances associated with it are presenting unprecedented challenges to our research enterprise.  UCIÕs research community has risen to these challenges, and I greatly appreciate all that you have done so far in response to this crisis. 

Driven by the rapidly escalating situation in the State of California, we now need to ramp down and curtail our on-campus research activities. Specifically, at this time, we need to do two things:

Effective immediately implement plans to ramp down non-critical research through May 1.  This must be accomplished by close of business on Friday, March 20.  To the extent feasible, non-critical research should be shifted to remote operations (i.e., home), or postponed to a later date.  From March 21 through May 1, only critical research will be conducted at UCI.  This period may be adjusted based on circumstances as they evolve.
Ensure that the human physical distance in our research operations exceeds the social distancing guidelines.
Principal Investigators (PIs), Lead Researchers (LRs) and lab managers should immediately begin this process and share their strategy with their department/school/research unit leadership.

CRITICAL v. NON-CRITICAL RESEARCH
Critical research activities means essential experiments and the essential personnel to carry them out. These activities are in most cases experimental research in university laboratories.

Essential experiments are:

Those for which cessation would be in conflict with funding agreements (consult with personnel in SPA or Beall Applied Innovation as applicable to assist you with determining if this is the case);
Where the phasing down and restarting of the research would cause irreparable harm to the research project/program; or
Related to improving general knowledge about the SARS CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 illness), and reducing the spread of COVID-19, including the development and testing of vaccine candidates.  
Essential experiments by definition include clinical trials, i.e., the controlled, clinical testing in human subjects of investigational new drugs, devices, treatments or diagnostics, or comparisons of approved drugs, devices, treatments or diagnostics, to assess their safety, efficacy, benefits, costs, adverse reactions, and/or outcomes.

Essential personnel are those individuals who are necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of critical research, including:

Laboratory personnel responsible for animal care, where such care is not provided by ULAR,
Personnel responsible for equipment maintenance that, if not done, could result in damage or high-cost equipment repairs (e.g., maintaining cryogen on NMR spectrometers),
Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion (e.g., the ability to make a specific measurement only a few times a year), and
Faculty and/or research staff necessary to maintain research materials that are perishable and not easily replaced.  For example, primary cell lines, and long-term experiments for which there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end (e.g., on-going, continual one-month experiment that requires regular measurements or maintenance otherwise all previous data is lost).
Please note that students (including graduate students and post-docs) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel; the decision to report to campus lies with the student worker, not their research advisor.

Preparing to Reduce Research Personnel Density
You may wish to use the Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist, adapted from peer institutions, to evaluate necessary steps in reducing research personnel density.  Please note that this is not an all-encompassing list, or a list for which all items will apply to a specific type of research or research in a specific discipline.  Rather, it is intended as a general tool to help inform researchers and focus their thoughts in preparing their plans and strategies.  As a reminder, the UC Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes).

Human Subjects Research
The general guidance posted on the Research Continuity website under the Human Research Protections section remains current, and should be carefully reviewed and followed by all researchers engaged in human research.

Research Personnel Health and Safety
The health and safety of UCI research personnel is a top priority.  PIs and LRs are responsible for encouraging all research personnel, including undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs to work from home whenever feasible.  They are also responsible for encouraging and modeling social distancing and good hygiene. 

Any researcher (regardless of their position or rank) must not come to work if they are sick.  This includes essential personnel, which is why redundancy in all aspects of preparedness planning (and especially in communication plans) is vitally important.  Be sure to establish a system by which research team members can and will check the status of each other.  We must look after not only our physical health, but also consider mental health and the impact that a pandemic event can have on our most valuable asset Ð the immensely creative and dedicated people that make up UCIÕs research community.

We are facing an unprecedented challenge with COVID-19, and all of us must all do our part to Òflatten the curveÓ to protect our community and lessen predictable pressures on our public health infrastructure.   While this process may be disheartening, know that the steps you take now will support the long-term success of our labs and research groups.

For questions regarding the ramp down and curtailment and how these actions may impact research, please direct them to the following:

For sponsored awards, please direct them to the officer in Sponsored Projects Administration or Beall Applied Innovation assigned to your unit, or to Nancy Lewis, Executive Director, Sponsored Projects Administration at nrlewis@uci.edu.

Irvine,18-Mar-2020,"Dear On-Campus Student Residents,

I am writing to follow up on two critical items related to financial aid and housing. In a March 13 message to students, it was stated that on-campus student residents choosing to return home for the Spring quarter could impact their financial aid packages. Today, the U.S. Department of Education has informed us that student aid packages will not need to be adjusted, should you choose to return to your permanent residence for Spring quarter.

We understand that some on-campus student residents have made decisions not to return to their permanent residence based on previous information. Given the news that financial aid packages will not be impacted by changes in housing status, I write to reiterate the message sent from Tim Trevan, Executive Director of UCI Housing. Our developing public health circumstance compels our decision: if you are able to return safely to your permanent residence, you must do so.

Please understand that these decisions are not easy to make, and are made in consideration of keeping our students, staff, and faculty healthy. As our founding Dean of Public Health, Bernadette Boden-Albala, has emphasized over the last several weeks, we all have a responsibility to do what is required to promote public health during the current emergency.

It is a public health threat for large numbers of students to reside in a contained campus living environment. If students do not return to their permanent residences at higher numbers, then there is a higher risk to all residents of acquiring COVID-19, merely because of the higher number of people in the immediate surroundings. It is also more likely that residents will make others sick, including those in populations that are more vulnerable. More significantly, we want to help ensure that you do not become a threat to your loved ones.  

Keep in mind that the resources you need for your academic success will be available to you wherever you decide to learn from in the Spring quarter. All classes will be taught remotely. Student services are also offered remotely. Additionally, there will be no campus events for the Spring quarter as any gathering inconsistent with social distancing will be restricted. In-person and on-campus resources have ramped down to minimal operations. Dining halls will only be serving boxed meals.

If you are an on-campus student resident and do not have a permanent residence to return to, we will work with you. You are part of the UCI family, and we are committed to finding a solution so you can have adequate housing.  

Not all on-campus student residents will be able to return safely to their permanent residence. There are multiple factors that we understand will require some students to remain in on-campus housing. For these reasons, if you are able to return safely to your permanent residence, you make it possible for us to create a much safer environment for those who do not have that option.

I understand that some of you may need a little more time to finalize your decision. I am issuing a directive to extend the deadline for you to inform us to Friday, March 20 by 5 p.m. If you already indicated you are staying, but would like to adjust your plans to return home or move off-campus, please update your survey response. We will work with you to ensure that you receive the proper refunds and fee adjustments. If you have a lease with ACC, please follow ACCÕs process to cancel your lease as ACC has agreed to allow UCI students to terminate their lease early without a cancelation penalty or rent being charged once you have left the unit.

Please stay up-to-date on the campus status at uci.edu/coronavirus. Should you need support, counseling, or other help, please reference the Coronavirus Information Hub for resources to manage through this difficult time.

I thank everyone for their commitment and attention. Making these personal adjustments is an act of community citizenship and compassion and I appreciate your flexibility and understanding during this difficult time.

Irvine,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

We would like to share a reminder about keeping your personal devices secure, especially as more of us are working remotely and using them to access UCI institutional data and resources. These cyber risk avoidance tips are applicable to both your personal life and work life at UCI. As remote work becomes the norm for now, letÕs ensure that we are safe and healthy, both physically and digitally.

Personal Device Security

Keep your devices patched with the latest security updates, donÕt use end-of-life operating systems.
Be mindful of going to ÒriskyÓ sites, installing ÒriskyÓ software, clicking ÒriskyÓ links, or responding to ÒriskyÓ emails. Double-check everything and only go to trusted sites, use trusted software, and respond to trusted contacts.
Run anti-virus/anti-malware software with latest updates if your operating system supports it.
Enable your operating systemÕs host-based firewall.
DonÕt login to your device using an ÒadministratorÓ account, instead use a normal non-privileged user account if your device supports it to limit the impact of potential compromises.
DonÕt store passwords unencrypted on your device (use a secure vault like LastPass instead http://oit.uci.edu/help/lastpass).
If using a mobile device, enable encryption with strong passwords.
Working Remote Securely

DonÕt copy P3 or P4 data to your personal device, even if temporarily. Use remote sessions to university managed devices instead. (What is P3 or P4 data? Please see https://security.uci.edu/security-plan/plan-classification-protection.html#P3 to learn more).
Enable session timeout and lock screen with a strong password to keep roommates, spouses, kids from disturbing your work.
Enable your home Internet router's firewall to block incoming connections from the Internet by default.

Irvine,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues, 

As we prepare for a spring quarter of remote teaching, I write to remind you about the online resources and professional development assistance at your disposal. In addition, I want to highlight ways that Schools are leveraging faculty and graduate student expertise. I strongly urge all of you to work together and share insights into unexplored ways to use technology.  

Jumping into remote teaching is not ideal for any of us, I have confidence in the creativity and resilience of the UCI instructional staff._ I am confident in our ability to channel our research talents to the challenge of this current crisis to serve our students as best we can, given our constraints._ 

As you start planning your quarter, keep in mind the following:  

1.    Some things will go wrong Ñ they always do. Be up front with your students about this from the beginning and engage them in the process. Help them understand that they are part of the process of navigating and solving the challenges before us as we model flexibility, creativity, and scholarship at its best._ 

2.    We have created a quick guide to help you start this process. We are not creating fully online courses. We are taking what we do every day and translating it into a new remote medium to minimize harms during a crisis. The translation will not be perfect, but it can still provide a high-quality educational experience and keeps us all safer. You will even find some things that work better. Bring those best practices back to classroom teaching in the future. Finally, unlike a fully online course, it does not have to be complete on day one of the quarter Ð it will evolve throughout the quarter._ 

3.    Use spring break for test runs of the technology for you and your students. If you are going to use Canvas, have the Canvas course created and published early. It can take up to an hour for the Canvas course to be created once you request it.  
 
If you are using YuJa (particularly useful because of its stability) and/or Zoom (particularly useful for office hours and real-time engagement), have at least one short test run for you and your students as a mini-test. Please remember that if you ask TAs to help you with these tasks, those hours count as part of their contracted hours for the quarter. 

4.    Recognize that the first week of the quarter is a Òwarm-upÓ week for both the technology and your pedagogical approach. This is a great time to evaluate what is core to your course and focus on developing the capacity of our students to direct more of their learning._  
 
Remember: one of our core goals is having students develop the capacity of Òlearning to learn,Ó and you will likely discover many opportunities to have them reflect on their own processes of learning as they adapt to this new instructional mode._ 

5.    Carefully consider your assessment strategy for remote learning. This is perhaps an aspect of the course that is impacted in the most nuanced way, so a little thought before the course starts can have a large payoff in the end._ Usual assessment mechanisms (such as high-stakes testing) might be less feasible this term, so use the opportunity to experiment with other forms of evaluation. More recommendations on assessment can be found here. 

6.    Make decisions between synchronous and asynchronous modes. Both modes of instruction are valuable in a remote setting and have their advantages and disadvantages. As a minimum, for any synchronous interaction, such as Zoom, it is useful to record and to allow students to interact with it later. Also, carefully consider impacts on synchronous interactions combined with potential technical glitches and time zones on assessment._ 

7.    Leverage the research on remote teaching. Once you have established the core elements of your course, some additional considerations include: (1) students often need additional support, investment, and scaffolding to move toward successful online learning that reflects self-directed philosophies; and (2) without proper scaffolding, learners may not be equally predisposed to engage in online learning that requires high levels of self-direction. There are many resources available to address these and other questions at http://digitallearning.dtei.uci.edu/ and https://www.olrc.us/. 

8.    Staff appropriately. Faculty are ultimately responsible for the delivery of courses and grades. Courses may have additional resources available to faculty in the form of TAs and Readers. These resources should be carefully considered, and if needed, submit requests to your Dean/Assistant Dean. These can include an increase in the appointment percentages of existing TAs and Readers, or request additional TAs or Readers. ASE appointments over 50% should be submitted via the normal approval channel and is subject to review and approval by the Graduate Division. Undergraduate Learning Assistants are also an option, updated information will be posted here.  

For many of these items, we have developed resources with more details. In particular, if you are looking for the minimal guide to start remote teaching, please go here, and you can also watch this 15 minutes Ògetting startedÓ video. I do not want to minimize the challenges many of you face translating a face-to-face experience with a rich history of success to the remote world. I am confident that together, UCI can be a model to other universities in this effort. ",885,cal,3
Irvine,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Parents and Students, 

I am writing to you to provide context as UCI moves to a quarter of remote teaching. Perhaps it will be helpful to clarify what remote teaching is, and at the same time, emphasize that it still will involve all the aspects of a traditional education: faculty and graduate student participation, opportunities for interaction (now in an online setting), and high-quality learning environments. The core of any course experience at a top, public research university are the interactions among the faculty and students, students with each other, and students with the material. The main difference between traditional courses and remote teaching is that the primary mode of these interactions moves from the physical classroom to the virtual classroom. Faculty members are still driving the design and the delivery of the experience and regularly interacting with the students. Students still engage with each other and the material. 

Learning to connect with each other in meaningful ways through technology is a skill that will serve our students well in their future careers and lives. We will always need face-to-face teaching Ñ teaching where we are all in the same room, learning together Ñ just as the live play was never replaced by the movie, and going to the movies has not been replaced by watching television at home. However, it is important to understand that these are unusual and challenging times that present a unique opportunity to connect, understand, and learn in novel ways. 

At this challenging moment, UCI is well positioned to support our students and faculty in this abrupt transition to remote learning for all courses during the spring quarter. Every year, we teach over 100 courses fully online with high standards and expectations of faculty and student engagement. Many and, in fact, most of our faculty have already infused technology into their classrooms and used it to enhance their face-to-face courses (see here for examples). We also have some of the top researchers in the area of remote learning (see here for examples). Their work into maximizing student success through technology is being deployed to support faculty in this transition. 

We understand that these are stressful times and that there is much uncertainty in all of our lives at present. Further, as with anything involving technology, we know that not everything in a given course will work perfectly the first time. And, even these moments will be opportunities for learning. Still, when it comes to remote instruction at UCI, we are confident in the creativity and patience of our faculty and of our students to navigate this new space and reach the same high standards of learning we expect of all Anteaters.",447,cal,3

Irvine,20-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

In my March 17, 2020 message to UCIÕs research community, I informed you of the need to ramp down and curtail UCIÕs research activities.  Now, with Governor NewsomÕs Executive Order N-33-20 (EO), all individuals living in the State of California are required to stay home or at their place of residence until further notice Òto preserve the public health and safety, and to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and prioritizing those at the highest risk and vulnerabilityÉÓ

The EO also clarifies that people may leave their homes or places of residence to report to work for an essential job. Conducting critical research is an essential job.

Because the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students is UCIÕs top priority, I am writing clarify what the EO means for UCIÕs research enterprise, and to update and expand upon the information contained in my March 17 message.  Above all, and to be abundantly clear, the expectation of UCIÕs leadership is that everyone in the research community consistently follow the below guidelines.

Non-Critical Research
The following applies to all non-critical research carried out on the Irvine or Orange campuses, or at facilities at other locations that are owned, leased, rented or accessed by UCI:

Research activities that cannot be carried out at home must be halted by 11:59 pm today.
Research activities that can be carried out at home (with or without telecommuting) should continue to the greatest extent possible.
When carrying out non-critical research at home, each team member must work from their own home/residence.  All communications between team members must be conducted by phone or other electronic means.
Computers, storage devices, lab notebooks and papers may be removed from laboratories to facilitate working from home.
Office supplies used in the course of research may be taken home only for the purpose of conducting UCI research and business.
Under no circumstances should specimens, animals, research supplies (other than office supplies used in the course of research), equipment, instruments, etc. be removed from laboratories without the prior approval of the cognizant dean or research unit director (as applicable) and the Vice Chancellor for Research (or designee).
Designate a primary and backup emergency contact for each research group.  With prior approval of the PI or Lead Research, these individuals may access the groupÕs research space periodically, but not frequently, to check on the status of the lab/space and equipment, as well as troubleshoot any problems reported by research group members (e.g., rebooting computers, etc.).  While doing so, they should exceed the social distancing guidelines and clean high-touch surfaces to the extent possible.  Emergency contacts must not conduct non-critical research in the research space while the EO is in effect.
Ensure that up-to-date emergency contact information for each research space is posted on all doors leading to the space.
Critical Research
A detailed definition of critical research can be found on the Critical Research definition page on the Research Continuity website. The following applies to all critical research carried out on the Irvine or Orange campuses, or at facilities at other locations that are owned, leased, rented or accessed by UCI:

To conduct critical research during EO effective period, Principal Investigators (PIs) and Lead Researchers (LRs) must obtain approval for critical research from their cognizant dean or research unit director.  Deans and Directors are setting up review processes for such approvals. We expect very few exceptions will be granted.
Critical research activities must be conducted in a manner to ensure that the human physical distance between employees exceeds the social distancing guidelines. 
Human Subjects Research
Non-critical human subject research activities that cannot be carried out with both the researcher in their own home and the subject in their own home must be halted by 11:59 pm today.  Human research that is non-critical and can be carried out from home must comply with the requirements noted in the Non-Critical Research section above.

The general guidance posted on the Research Continuity website under the Human Research Protections section remains current for critical research, but is subject to change as circumstances evolve, so please check back frequently.

Domestic and International Field Research and Research at Sea
Research activities currently being carried out in the field must be halted unless the research team can ensure that the human physical distance between team members will consistently exceed the social distancing guidelines.  In the case that research is halted, the PI is responsible for ensuring social distancing is practiced to the maximum extent practicable when traveling back to UCI.

Research activities currently being carried out at sea should continue for the duration of the voyage, but the PI is responsible for ensuring that the research team members practice social distancing to the maximum extent practicable.  To the extent applicable, researchers returning from sea must also observe CDC travel guidelines.

Field research and research at sea that has not yet commenced must be postponed until further notice.

Students and Postdocs
Faculty and PIs/LRs are encouraged to work creatively with students to ensure they can remain on track for graduation despite disruption to research activities.
Undergraduate student, graduate students and postdocs are not and cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel.
Students or postdocs have the right to refuse to conduct critical research.
Students and postdocs should follow the guidelines established by their department, school and UCI leadership regarding whether they should remain on campus or stay at home.
Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist
The Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist should be used to prepare for halting non-critical research and preparing to minimizing activities associated with critical research.

Research Personnel Health and Safety
PIs and Lead Researchers (LR) must require that all research personnel work from home if feasible.  They are also responsible for ensuring that all essential personnel under their direction follow the social distancing guidelines.  For critical research, PIs and LRs are responsible for reducing the density of people working in their research space.

Any researcher (regardless of their position or rank) must not come to work if they are sick.  This includes essential personnel, which is why redundancy in all aspects of preparedness planning (and especially in communication plans) is vitally important.  Be sure to establish a system by which research team members can and will check the status of each other.  We must look after not only our physical health, but also consider mental health and the impact that a pandemic event can have on our most valuable asset Ð the immensely creative and dedicated people that make up UCIÕs research community.

COVID-19 Related Expenses
To the extent your lab incurs COVID-19 related expenses, please ensure that your lab staff requests funding for and codes those expenses as indicated by DFA: https://www.budgetoffice.uci.edu/covid-19-funding-request/index.php.

Irvine,20-Mar-2020,"As we confront a pandemic unprecedented in modern times, first please allow me to say thank you. Thank you to our students, faculty and staff for rising to the challenges of this disruption to continue our world-class learning experience. Thank you to family members for accommodating the impact the changes here have produced in their lives. And thank you to our alumni and donors for your interest and concern about what is taking place and your kind offers to help however you can. Your support and the can-do team spirit of everyone at UCI BioSci are keeping us moving forward to what can and will be a brighter future.
 
Our school, our university, our nation and our globe will weather the pandemic, and it is within our power as biologists to create a better future. In fact, as life sciences experts, we are the people who are uniquely capable of doing so. Each of us must understand this, embrace it, and commit to stepping up and doing our part.

What BioSci is Doing Right Now About COVID-19

To most people in the general public, the coronavirus seems to have come out of nowhere. They perceive it as an unknown enemy, which makes its spread especially terrifying. But as biologists, we already know a great deal about coronaviruses and lately about COVID-19. 
 
Experts throughout BioSci are conducting critical COVID-19 research. Our top virologists are working with a national consortium of leading scientists evaluating whether antibodies neutralizing viruses that are extracted from the blood of recovered COVID-19 patients can serve as an emergency treatment for the disease. They are also collaborating on cloning key elements of the COVID-19, SARS and MERS coronavirus strains to study how our bodies recognize and attack these viruses. Other BioSci researchers are investigating COVID-19Õs impact on the nervous system.

COVID-19 Will Be Vanquished

We know that coronavirus can and will be vanquished, and it will happen due to the fundamental work of biologists. Without the essential scientific knowledge we produce, vaccinations, therapeutics and cures for this virus and all other biological hazards, would be impossible. The information we uncover during this pandemic will help us overcome and even prevent the next one.

Life Interconnected

What we are experiencing demonstrates that mind, body and world health is interconnected. As environmental threats rise unchecked, the wellbeing of our globe and all who inhabit it suffers. What we are seeing with this coronavirus foreshadows what is to come; unless we all commit to doing everything we can to change the future. And we can change it. How do we change it? As individuals, as the School of Biological Sciences and as a society as a whole, we must embrace and support the leading role of biology in shaping the future.

How You Will Change the Future

To our students, I say you will do so through your continued commitment to your education here. To our faculty and researchers, please continue to conduct the world-class education and scientific inquiry that advances discovery, remotely for the time being. Alumni, please keep using the knowledge youÕve gained here to perform crucial work in the life sciences, and to advocate for biology on a broader basis. To our donors, I emphasize that we need your crucial support and resources to advance our mission and to recruit more advocates to this very crucial cause. Our nation and our world desperately require what each of you can personally do.

Listen to the Clarion Call

This pandemic is a clarion call for greater investment in and commitment to biologists and biological research. I am, and all of us should be, extremely proud of the work we do. We should know as biology students, biology teachers, family members and donors that the challenges we are facing today can and will be overcome. It will take fundamental research, hard work and dedication, but we at UCI BioSci serve a crucial, critical role in achieving this goal. I call upon each of you to step up and proudly work as a team to make our world a better place. I will be proudly working alongside you. ",686,cal,3
Irvine,21-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Community:

Last night, we were informed that a non-student resident of UCIÕs campus family housing tested positive for COVID-19. The individual returned from an international trip with symptoms and has been resting comfortably in good condition.

In accordance of health privacy laws, we cannot disclose the identity or personal information regarding the individual. We have coordinated with the Orange County Health Care Agency and been in touch with those who may have been exposed through contact.

The risk to the general campus population remains low. As testing becomes more available in the coming weeks, it is likely that we will become aware of additional positive cases within the UCI community. In addition to directly notifying anyone who may be exposed through contact, moving forward, we will notify the campus community through the COVID-19 Latest Updates emails and as aggregate information at UCIÕs Coronavirus Information Hub. 

As we begin spring break, we remain diligent in our efforts to keep our community safe. Remote learning for Spring quarter is underway and large gatherings have been canceled. Our social-distancing efforts will help our community Òflatten the curveÓ and deploy vital health care resources to those who need it most.

This situation, both locally and globally, continues to evolve. Please refer to our Coronavirus website for important information and updates. You may also contact our Coronavirus Response Center at 949-824-9918 (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m.) or covid19@uci.edu if you have any questions or comments.

We understand that the uncertainty and seriousness of this pandemic may cause distress and anxiety for many of us. Assistance is available for those who need it. For students, our counseling center continues to provide services remotely; faculty and staff may use the services of our employee assistance program.

ItÕs important that we remain diligent in preventing the spread of the virus. Please remember to wash your hands well, cover your mouth with your elbow, stay home if youÕre sick, and disinfect surfaces, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We will continue to keep our community updated as new developments occur. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and your loved ones. Your health and security are our primary concern.",370,cal,3
Irvine,21-Mar-2020,"Dear alumni, donors and friends,

First and foremost, our thoughts are with you and our global community during this unprecedented time. The safety and well-being of everyone, especially our Anteater family, are of the utmost importance to us. We continue to closely monitor this evolving situation, and because it is changing at such a rapid pace, we have established a new website, which is serving as a gathering place for accurate and timely information about events and conditions on campus. Please visit often for the latest information.

To ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff on campus, the university has taken immediate action. All campus instruction is now done remotely; as many staff as possible are now telecommuting to work; many buildings and facilities, including residential facilities on campus, are closing; all events, including our Anteater sports teams, have been canceled or postponed; and we are retaining only limited on-site operations for critical functions.

You can find a list of all impacted alumni and university advancement events here, which will continue to be updated. If you have registered for an upcoming event, you will be contacted directly with more information.

UCI remains dedicated to your health and lifelong well-being in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the day this virus was first recognized, UCI Health researchers and medical experts have worked closely with other hospitals and healthcare providers Ð regionally and across the nation Ð sharing best practices while staying current with the latest information, treatments and tools.

A team of UCI researchers is already working on a COVID-19 therapeutic drug study. Backed by the National Institutes of Health, this clinical trial is considered the first that has possible efficacy and should be ready for patients soon. Other university work is underway to develop tests, treatments and vaccines to help us identify, contain and prevent pandemics.

Many have asked, ÒHow can I support UCI?Ó as we navigate this uncertain time. The best way is to support the UCI Emergency Response Fund, which provides the university with the flexibility to respond to the most pressing and emerging needs.

We are continually moved and inspired by how quickly the UCI community comes together. As we work to meet the needs of our campus and global community, we send our thoughts to all those impacted by the virus. Thank you for your commitment to UCI, and for your patience and understanding as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances.",409,cal,3
Irvine,22-Mar-2020,"Dear campus community,

As many of you know, UCI is home for many Anteaters. As a community, we are facing challenging circumstances as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to support those who are staying on campus because the safety of our community remains our primary concern. Security patrols are being performed on a routine basis.

Because campus operations have transitioned to remote instruction and telecommuting for many business functions, several UCI buildings have been closed until further notice. This does not mean that critical services and work have stopped. Departments and organizations will continue to carry out approved critical functions while maintaining social distancing guidelines. Those authorized to continue supporting our critical functions will continue to have access to applicable campus buildings.

A current list of closed buildings is posted on UCIÕs COVID-19 website and will be routinely updated. We are currently working with Office of Research, Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, student services, building managers, and other campus leadership to develop clear guidance to access certain buildings to retrieve necessary paperwork, teach remote classes, and check on critical infrastructure. This information will be shared soon.

Enhanced custodial services continue for open buildings. 

If you have immediate concerns about building access, please contact your supervisor, building facilities manager, or send an email to the ChancellorÕs Executive Policy Group at cepg-center@uci.edu or the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response Center at covid19@uci.edu.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through these unprecedented times. Please continue to take good care of yourselves and support one another.",261,cal,3
Irvine,23-Mar-2020,"Dear Instructors,

As we move into spring break and preparation for spring quarter, I recognize that there have been numerous communications over the last few weeks and that the landscape has also changed significantly over this period. If you would like easy access to previous emails, we have archived them on the main UCI COVID-19 site:

uci.edu/coronavirus


A few messages that may be particularly relevant include:

March 19: Update on Remote Teaching for Parents and Students

March 19: Remote Teaching Information (This focuses on undergraduate teaching. Though many of the suggestions can be applicable to graduate courses as well, please check with your Department for any graduate specific policy or procedural differences.)

Irvine,23-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Post-Docs:

I am truly sorry that your first day of Spring Break began with an announcement of a COVID-19 positive case on our campus. Many of you remain in Irvine, in graduate family housing, as we all seek to play our own best role in this global battle to lessen and eventually eliminate the threat of the coronavirus pandemic;

As you know, this morning UCI announced that a case of COVID-19 has been confirmed among the UCI community. In line with University policy and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Orange County Health Care Agency, the affected individual is self-isolating off campus. Students, faculty, and staff who may have had direct contact with the individual are being notified and will be asked to self-isolate. If you were identified as someone who has been in contact with, or in close proximity to, any individual who has tested positive for the virus, you will be notified. If you were not identified as such, your risk is no different than it was yesterday, and you should continue to follow the same best practices and recommendations. 

Your safety and well-being are my utmost concern. Campus authorities are closely monitoring and evaluating this unfolding situation. 

I wish I could tell you when we can expect things to return to normal. Sadly, no one can. What I will commit to you is that I will tell you whatever I can, regularly, while being as transparent as possible.

We will open labs and studios, return to in-person courses, reignite our exciting array of in-person intensives, workshops, performances, and more as soon as we are safely able.

In accordance with health privacy laws, we cannot disclose the identity or personal information regarding the individual nor which housing community is theirs. If you are aware of their identity, please respect their privacy so they can focus on their health and recovery. Until widespread testing can be achieved, it is still best to assume that everyone has been exposed, including you, even if you have no symptoms. A confirmed case on our campus does not change those recommendations.

We remain diligent in our efforts to keep our community safe. Campus residence and dining halls, as well as health services, remain open for students who stay during the break and/or from the start of the spring quarter. We are working to ensure that students who need funding assistance with items related to COVID-19 are able to request special funding from the University wherever possible. For example, AGS has special travel grants for those seeking to leave campus, and TAs who need additional technology to support emergency distance learning can request it through their departments. We will continue in our efforts to marshal additional resources and share those when we are able.

Our social-distancing efforts will help our community Òflatten the curveÓ and deploy vital health care resources to those who need it most. This situation, both locally and globally, continues to evolve.  Please refer to our Coronavirus website for important information and updates.  You may also contact our Coronavirus Response Center at 949-824-9918 or covid19@uci.edu if you have any questions or comments.

I am awe-struck by the incredible stories of kindness and resiliency I continue to hear from our community. IÕve been incredibly impressed by the number of staff from Graduate Division who have been volunteering to help at the Fresh Needs Hub or to donate blood. IÕve been amazed at the number of student workers volunteering to help out with UCIÕs clinical needs. Earlier in the week, I was told about an entire research team who had lost access to several field sites at K-12 schools and were able to rapidly turn their project into one focused on distance learning. Yesterday, I had a PhD student tell me that this crisis has reaffirmed her resolve to succeed, and she has been making more progress on her writing than ever before. IÕve also heard tales from my colleagues at other universities of butchering their first emergency distance learning class, only to have the undergraduate students and grad TAs help them recover, with everyone learning a lot in the process.

There is no doubt that many of us are suffering. We will not know the full extent for some time. I am, and remain always, an optimist. Stay safe, wash your hands, and be kind to yourself and each other. We will get through this together. Should you want to talk, reach out to UCI Counseling Services, who can offer telehealth services, as well as the Graduate Division counselors, Elizabeth Dunn (dunnes@uci.edu) and Phong Luong (pbluong@uci.edu). Reach out to each otherÑvirtually or at a distanceÑand talk through what you are experiencing. We need to you to stay physically isolated right now, but please know that you are not alone. 

I look forward to seeing you as soon as I can. In the meantime, be safe, be kind, and be well.",826,cal,3
Irvine,23-Mar-2020,"On Saturday, we shared with you news that a health care worker had tested positive for COVID-19. This person was masked and wearing appropriate PPE during the onset of mild symptoms. Please keep the following in mind:

The infection was community acquired and everyone who was in contact with this person has been notified is being monitored.
Exposure doesnÕt mean you should stop working; Occupational Health and EIP have posted guidelines. View FAQs and guidelines here
Drive-up Testing Sites
Our ambulatory team has done a wonderful job getting two drive-up testing sites up and running last week. The site at 200 Manchester was ready to see UCI Health patients last Tuesday, having it operational in just a few days. The site at Gottschalk Medical Plaza began swabbing patients on Friday. This effort not only adds convenience for our patients, it relieves the demand on the Pav 3 clinic. Congratulations and a heartfelt thank you to all involved!

UCI Health Staff Treat Carts
Over the weekend, the Culinary and Nutrition and Patient Experience Guest Services teams launched a program to deliver treat care packages to UCI Health care teams. The entire UCI Health leadership team applauds their initiative to recognize colleaguesÕ hard work and dedication to patients during these challenging times. Though they werenÕt able to reach every unit, their efforts will continue this week.

UCI Blood Donor Center Donation Request
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the UCI Blood Donor Center hard and has stretched supplies available for our trauma program. If you are feeling well and healthy, please consider donating blood. Visit the UCI Blood Donor Center website to schedule a blood or platelet donation at the Medical Center site. Donations may be scheduled via telephone at 714-456-5733, or at the website

Offers of PPE
UCI Health has received several kind offers of PPE from members of our community. As inquiries role in, we will assess our needs and whether the materials are compliant. The current protocol for reviewing PPE offers are as follows: 

PPE or other supply offers will be forwarded to the attention of the UCI Health Supply Chain, Maurra Baruch at mbaruch@hs.uci.edu or 714-456-3863. 
In collaboration with UCOP, who are validating and planning to coordinate resources system wide, our supply chain team will evaluate our needs and assess compliance.

Irvine,23-Mar-2020,"Hello Grad Students and Post-Docs,

For those of you having a much needed rest on this first day of Spring Break, enjoy it! It can be hard to feel anything but guilt and anxiety when so many around us are losing jobs, falling ill, or coping with seemingly impossible situations. ItÕs okay to relax for a minute and not worry. Put on your own mask first, as they say on the airplane. You will be up and ready again soon enough.

For those of you not resting, perhaps because you are madly writing a paper or studying for your comprehensive exams, or perhaps because you are home-schooling children, or perhaps because you are working in healthcare, youÕve got this! You are strong and excellent and incredible or you would not be in the position you are.

Now, for a few small updates from campus and answers to questions we have gotten:

UCI Libraries Remote Resources:
Did you forget to return that library book? I know in my house we did, and my second grader is racking up some pretty hefty fines. The good news is that just like his elementary school, UCI understands these are not normal times. Please check out the libraryÕs website for additional information on remote resources: https://www.lib.uci.edu/remote-resources

In the middle of the page is a section that will answer many questions--called ""Managing Your Library Account"" and ""Returning Materials"":

Our book drops are open at Langson and Science Libraries.
If an item is due and you are unable to renew it and do not want to come to campus to return it (due to illness or other extenuating circumstances), you should keep it until you are able to safely return it. If you are charged late fees, please email us at circadm@uci.edu. We understand that this is a special situation, and special considerations will be made.
Books can also be returned by mail at:
UC Irvine Libraries, Attn: John Bareford,
P.O. Box 19557
Irvine CA 92623
If you do return your items it will not be reflected in your library account until staff are able to return onsite.
Reminder about Health Services:

Student Health is up and running for those of you on or near the Irvine campus. From their website:

Effective 3-9-2020 followed by additional guidance received 3-16-2020, UC SHIP will reduce the student cost share to $0 for all medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with directives recently issued by the CA Department of Managed Care and the CA Department of Insurance. Cost sharing includes, but is not limited to, copays, deductibles or coinsurance. Medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 may include hospital services (including emergency department), urgent care visits, provider office visits, telehealth encounters (e.g., LiveHealth Online) and clinical labs where the purpose of the visit is to be screened, tested and/or treated for COVID-19.

If you have GSHIP and are not on or near the Irvine campus, please check out the information on GSHIP online. Most notable:

When you are traveling away from home and/or campus, you have access to care across the country through AnthemÕs BlueCard¨ PPO Program. If youÕre traveling outside the U.S., you have access to care through the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program. For assistance, please visit Anthem Blue Cross or contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center at (800) 810-2583 (BLUE).

Housing:

So far, it appears that only a small number of students currently living in grad and family housing have requested to move out. For the rest of you, please remember to use proper social distancing procedures and to obey the GovernorÕs Stay at Home order. This means, in short, other than your household, you should really not be interacting with other people in person. This doesnÕt mean you canÕt go outside. It does mean when you go outside, you should be a MINIMUM of 6ft apart from people who do not live in your home. 

Requests for Additional Support:

We are examining requests systemwide for additional financial support as well as waivers, changes to degree requirements, changes to time to degree, and so on. There are no easy answers to these questions, and most challenging is that none of us can predict the future. We wouldnÕt want to approve a one quarter extension or waiver only to learn that the impacts require something much longer nor make major changes only to find there is a cure next week (we can hope!). So, please be patient, and know that we are watching all of these things. We are only one week into our Stay at Home process, and we simply donÕt know what we donÕt know yet.

And Now the Good News:

UCI is one of many places currently conducting clinical trials on drugs that can treat COVID-19. I am incredibly proud and honored to know that some of your research will go towards ending this epidemic. Some of you are creating beautiful art that responds to our current crisis. Others of you are studying impacts of social distancing on children, on society, and on vulnerable populations, such as those coping with domestic violence or in need of clean water. PhD students in Education are on the forefront of studying remote learning, especially for people with chronic illness or disabilities, that can now be leveraged to lessen impacts for our families and other scholars in Education are asking important questions about the very nature of the university experience. PhD students in Social Ecology and Social Sciences are on the forefront of understanding the particular adverse impacts of this crisis on the homeless or on our elections, and of course our graduate students in Public and Population Health are the next generation of practitioners and scholars to address this and any future public health crises. Our virologists are working towards creating vaccines for this and other diseases. Never before has the need for and importance of academic scholarship been more clear. 

Let us all hope for a brighter week this week than last.

Irvine,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

We are gratified and uplifted by the enormous interest on the part of the campus community to reallocate/repurpose needed equipment to the UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) as they respond to the COVID-19 crisis. In an effort to coordinate internal reallocation/repurposing of these items and assist UCIMC with their urgent need for personal protective equipment (PPE), Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) will be the point of contact for the campus. 

The items that UCIMC will accept are the following:

Face shields
Goggles
General face masks
Gloves
N95 respirators
Isolation gowns (disposable)
Hand sanitizer (manufacturer made, not compoents)
UCIMC has indicated that they cannot accept any separate components to make hand sanitizer due to DOT regulations and nosocomial swabs because they must be a certain type for medical use.  Please do not bring any items that are not listed above due to space constraints.

Prior to drop-off, in order to ensure safe receipt and delivery of PPE, please read these instructions carefully:
Before delivery, please fill out an intake form, then print and bring with you the email acknowledgment of your submission (A link to this form will also be available on UCIÕs Coronavirus Information Hub website).  This form will assist EH&S in organizing the incoming items and ensure the items are distributed to UCIMC and to any other campus units that are most in need.  Please keep good records of reallocated items for reconciliation later, in particular those charged to federal funds.  EH&S is not able to return any unused items so please remember to keep PPE in stock for your own research needs.  Please note: This is not a charitable donation.

Irvine,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty, 

As we prepare for remote instruction for Spring quarter and you spend more time with UCIÕs learning management system (LMS), with Canvas and with Zoom, I write to offer the following: 

1.      We have prepared this script for you to announce at the beginning of class meetings: 

ÒThis [class meeting/discussion group/etc.] is being conducted over Zoom.  As the instructor, I will be recording this session.  I have disabled the recording feature for others so that no one else will be able to record this session.  I will be posting this session to the courseÕs website at [LMS/Canvas location].  If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in the recording, you may turn video off (click Òstop videoÓ) so that Zoom does not record you.  If, when you disable live video, you also want to use a profile image (other than a picture of you) instead of your name, please let me know which image you will be using so that I know who you are during the session.  If you would like to ask a question, you may do so privately through the Zoom chat by addressing your chat question to me only (and not to ÒeveryoneÓ), or you may contact me by another private method.  If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact me.Ó 

2.      You can protect the privacy of your students and enable students with disabilities to absorb each session by taking the following steps: 

A.    Record your sessions in Zoom (after modifying your settings as described below), record the session locally, and upload the recording into YuJa for embedded distribution with YuJa Media Chooser.  This will: (i) make it very difficult for someone to grab the link and share/download the session and (ii) allow you to modify the settings in your Zoom profile settings. 

B.     Modify settings as follows in your Zoom profile: 

á         Settings/meeting: turn OFF Òauto saving chatsÓ 

á         Settings/meeting: turn ON Òallow host to type closed captions or assign a participant/third party device to add closed captionsÓ 

á         Settings/recording: turn OFF Òlocal recording: allow hosts and participants to record the meeting to a local fileÓ 

á         Settings/recording: turn ON Òcloud recording: allow hosts to record and save the meeting in the cloudÓ 

3.      I encourage you to provide your remote instruction via UCIÕs LMS/Canvas.  Although it is not perfect (and we are working to improve it), it provides you with the best protection related to copyright issues in two ways: (a) you have more protection from claims that you have infringed someone elseÕs copyrights when you use anotherÕs work in your materials if your course is delivered via LMS/Canvas, and (b) the technology of LMS/Canvas makes it more difficult for anyone to copy and distribute your materials.

Irvine,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues, 

We are living through unprecedented times. For most of us, this paradigm of living, learning, teaching and serving may change the way we navigate the future. This COVID-19 pandemic gets to the core why many of us have chosen a profession in healthcare and research.

Every person receiving this email has the power to help improve the health and well-being of our community.  You, me, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends, we are all in this together. Many of us have even chosen to serve as pharmacists, scientists, and healthcare providers because of our desire to serve the greater good and make positive change in this world. 

Today, I write to inform you of some of the ways the Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy Practice along with UCI Health pharmacists are combating COVID-19. 

COVID-19 Testing & Research
UCI faculty and scientists are rising to the challenge of protecting communities across Orange County during this difficult time. As Orange County's only academic health system, UCI Health and UCI Medical Center are well-equipped to manage the care of patients with infectious diseases.

In the lab, we are working on creating tools for expedient testing and blocking the SARS CoV-2 virus. Many of our world-class faculty members are experts on the development of diagnostic methods and on RNA, which makes up the CoV-2Õs genome.

In the clinic, our UCI pharmacists are working alongside other healthcare providers to develop COVID-19 treatment protocols to best serve our communities. 
 
Campus & Community Updates 
As you may know, UCI has suspended in-person courses, events, and non-essential research. The Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy Practice have taken advantage of our small but growing size to rapidly respond to the challenge of offering a virtual academic environment for our students. Additionally, UCI has created a comprehensive website for coronavirus updates for the UCI community: https://uci.edu/coronavirus

Lastly, I encourage you to use methods that will help us all continue to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our brilliant future will continue to happen together. Please practice social distancing, wash your hands, and don't forget to Zot, Zot, Zot! ",353,cal,3
Irvine,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Anteaters:

These are very difficult times and not having the right equipment to access your coursework can make them even more difficult. To help alleviate the challenge of securing appropriate computer equipment for remote learning, UCI has secured a number of laptops for free loan during Spring quarter to students who donÕt have access to key remote learning tools.

In particular, students who donÕt have access to the following computer equipment, which is required to run Zoom (for web conferencing) and Respondus Monitor + LockDown Browser (for online test proctoring), might benefit from borrowing a laptop:

=         -Windows or Mac OS X operating systems (Google Chromebooks, iPads, iPhones, and Android tablets and phones do not support Respondus)

=         -A webcam

=         -A microphone

Please review the following Student Laptop Loan Program details before submitting a request:

=        -Each laptop has a webcam and microphone and the following software pre-installed: Microsoft Windows 10, Microsoft Office 365, Google Chrome browser, Zoom, and Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. You can install additional software.

=         -The loan is free of charge, but fines will be imposed for damage (beyond normal wear and tear), late return, or non-return (including because of loss or theft), up to $800.

=         -You must be able to pick up the laptop from campus on a weekday between 9:00am and 4:00pm. We will use appropriate social distancing during the pickup process. We are, unfortunately, unable to ship out laptops at this time but will explore this and let you know if things change.

=         -The programÕs laptops have been leased by UCI and must be returned to campus during the week of June 15th either in person or by shipping. If shipping, you are responsible for proper packaging, costs, and any damage incurred in the process.

To request a laptop loan, please follow the link below and submit a request form:

 https://forms.gle/HJdqduHWpKNrHkqTA

For students working as instructional assistants, TAs, Readers, or Research Assistants who need additional equipment for that work, you should request this equipment through your hiring department rather than through this loan program.

If you have any questions about the Student Laptop Loan Program, please email: mailto:studentequipment@uci.edu

I want to start this message with a very heartfelt congratulations to Rebecca Riley, who was named UCIÕs 2020 Grad Slam Champion last month! Rebecca is a doctoral student studying Theoretical Particle Physics. In her Grad Slam talk entitled In the Dark Corners of the Universe, Rebecca describes the mystery of dark matter and its importance to the world - all in under 3 minutes! Take a listen to her impressive talk on why dark matter...well, matters! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbekjAnvDHg&feature=youtu.be).

Unfortunately due to COVID-19 concerns, the UC Office of the President made the difficult decision to cancel the UC-systemwide 2020 Grad Slam Competition, initially scheduled to take place on May 8th in San Francisco, CA. We know Rebecca would have made us proud! 

DSC COVID-19 Update
The DSC website has been updated with accessibility tips and resources for online instruction and remote classes for faculty and students. Please visithttps://dsc.uci.edu/covid19/ for more.

In Closing
I want to close today by talking a bit about how many of us are feeling right now. I heard the news today that Cal State was on a hiring freeze only shortly before learning that the partner of someone I care about a lot got a tenure track position at a community college. I heard the news today that Brown University was on a hiring freeze only shortly after seeing a copy of a contract for a tenure track position that someone asked me to look over so she could sign it. The roller coaster of emotions is nearly crushing, and these are not my own jobs but those of people in the UCI community. I can only imagine how it must feel to be at or near the end of your academic journey as either a post-doc or grad student and looking into this job market. 

Even for those who have a few years for the economy to recover before you search for jobs, summer internships have been disrupted, partners and family members may have been laid off. This is a brutal time for so many. Some of you may feel emboldened or focused or motivated by these times of crisis. Some of you may be able to only do the bare minimum each day to keep your health, your familyÕs health, and your life in order. I hope you are kind and generous with yourselves. We are not even two weeks into the Òstay at homeÓ order, and we have no idea what time will bring. 

It is okay to grieve. And please know that you are grieving. IÕve said before that I am an optimist, and I remain so. We are all living through something that no living person has ever seen, and we must hope that we will never see it again.

ÒWhen the unthinkable happens, the lighthouse is hope. Once we choose hope, everything is possible.Ó Ð Christopher Reeve

I am deeply sad for the pain that so many of you are feeling. I am anxious on my own. But I also have hope. I hope that we will learn from this time. I hope that we will find a cure. I hope that we will see a vaccine soon. I hope that disruption will be minimal.

And as always, I hope to see you all in person soon!",1339,cal,3
Irvine,25-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Community,

As we are all adjusting to teaching, working and learning in a virtual world due to COVID-19, OIT would like to remind students and employees of the technological services and tools available to facilitate campus business remotely. Whether you need to instruct a course, meet and collaborate with a colleague, or complete coursework remotely, OIT is committed to meeting your technology needs. Here are recently deployed tools that support our collective remote work:

Zoom: A powerful web conferencing tool is now available to all faculty, staff, and students. You can host an online gathering for instruction or meetings for up to 300 people.
Campus VPN: WeÕve added capacity on the campus VPN (Virtual Private Network) to accommodate the increase in off-campus traffic. VPN allows you to access University resources, such as your work computer or UCI Libraries resources from off campus.
Virtual Computing Lab: The virtual computing lab allows students and faculty to use common research software such as Matlab, SPSS, SAS, and others in a virtual environment remotely.
Respondus Lockdown Browser + Monitor: Facilitate exams with this combination of tools that restricts computer activity and provides for automated exam session monitoring and recording.
Adobe Creative Cloud: For a limited time through May 31, Adobe has made the Creative Cloud suite available to all campus. This includes popular applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and other premium Adobe software.
Laptops for Loan: Faculty, staff, and students who do not have a computer available at home may request OIT-provided laptops to loan on a limited basis.
Keep updated on information and resources for remote work with TechPrep @ UCI and other Virtual Tools and Resources.

If you need support for any of the above services, please contact the OIT Help Desk at (949) 824-2222 or oit@uci.edu. You can also follow OIT on Twitter for tips, tools and updates on technology at UCI.",313,cal,3
Irvine,26-Mar-2020,"With campus access limited to essential individuals only, UCI Payment Services has temporarily modified its service offerings and procedures for payment card solutions, cashiering, and handling of deposits. Campus departments should review the information below and adjust any internal processes as needed.

Payment Card Solutions

All TouchNet Marketplace & Aventri inquiries can be emailed to Lindsay Carroll at carrolll@uci.edu or Nick Troup at troupn@uci.edu.
All inquiries regarding the use of third-party payment systems, new merchant setups, PCI-related questions or concerns should be emailed to pcsgroup@uci.edu.
The Campus Terminal Rental Program is suspended until further notice.
Central Cashiers

Central Cashiers are primarily on a remote schedule.
All in-person service windows in Aldrich Hall are closed.
UCI departments should not accept cash at this time.
Central Cashiers will process checks and deposits picked-up from the North Campus Mail Processing Center on Thursdays.
Sub-cashier deposits will be accepted only by appointment on Thursdays. Please contact Payment Services at cashiers@uci.edu.
COD System Deposits - New Processing Procedures

With most campus departments now working remotely, there is still a need to ensure deposits are delivered safely to UCI Payment Services. UCI departments receiving checks that need to be deposited should institute the cash handling procedures below for the duration of the current public health emergency.

Be Aware of Limited Campus Mail Service

Campus business offices should keep in mind that Distribution Services is running limited service during the next several weeks. No mail is being picked up or delivered to campus departments. Drop boxes and mailboxes across campus have been emptied and signage has been placed informing customers not to use them at this time. The drop slot outside the main entrance to Aldrich Hall, second floor is available, but it is a very small slot. If you have a large deposit, please send it via campus mail by dropping it off at the North Campus Mail Processing Center.

To Ensure Monies are Secure and Deposited Weekly:

UCI department staff planning to make check deposits should do the following:
Staff with a valid UCI ID may retrieve their incoming mail from the North Campus Mail Processing Center 9:30 Ð 10:30 a.m., Monday through Friday.
Prepare checks for deposit through Campus Online Deposit (COD). Only staff with COD approved Kuali Security Access Management System (KSAMS) access can complete this step.
Departments may drop off their outgoing mail at the North Campus Mail Processing Center from 7 Ð 9 a.m. for same day service. Outgoing mail delivered from 9 a.m. Ð 2 p.m. will be processed the following business day.
Questions? Please contact Payment Services at cashiers@uci.edu.",430,cal,3
Irvine,27-Mar-2020,"Dear Grad Students and Post-Docs,

Each day since we received orders to Òstay at homeÓ from the governor have brought us each our own trials. More than 3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, and in a world without universal healthcare, this means many have lost their ability to combat this pandemic at the same time. Although all of you can get health insurance through UCI, you may have partners, friends, and others in need. If so, please remember that they can buy coverage at Covered California if they are in this state. Also, please remember if your friends or family have been laid off as part of this crisis, they can file for state unemployment as well as the additional federal coverage provided by the stimulus package. 

A big thanks to David Levinson, owner of Levinson Tax Services and current Merage MPAc student, for writing a summary of the stimulus package that even I could understand. 

Answers to Some Questions We Have Been Getting

Coursework
You may have noticed that the campus has made it possible (via the Registrar) to change between graded and not much later into the quarter than typically allowed. 

For grad classes, P/NP is not a valid option if you want it to Òcount.Ó It must be S/U (satisfactory-unsatisfactory). DonÕt ask me why. It way predates me, and I honestly donÕt know. Please watch for it though if you are in a course in which faculty have turned on these options. 
If you are a TA/Reader, please remember to share grade information regularly with your students so that they can make the best decision for themselves whether they want things graded.
Broad implementation of grading strategies at the graduate level continue to be in the control of the schools and programs. Some have chosen to go with a wide range of S/U courses and some have not. In some cases, these decisions are impacted by accreditation and professional certification requirements. Please check in with your grad program advisor if you have questions about this.  

Michael Dennin, Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, will be hosting a series of office hours for the next two weeks to help with the ramping up of the quarter.

These will be 4 Ð 5 pm on:

Monday March 30
Tuesday March 31
Thursday April 2
Tuesday April 7
Wednesday April 8
Thursday April 9

Emergency Financial Support
Some of you have reached out about rent relief and other sources of aid during this crisis. Student Affairs, Housing, and other facilities are currently being assessed for what can be done. What I have seen of their efforts is a group of people working as hard as they can as fast as they can to do the best they can by all of you while also recognizing the impacts of the massive loss of revenue from students moving out, conferences cancelling, and limits on external programs. We must balance what we do to keep both students and staff safe, keep our staff employed even without our usual operating funds, and keep essential services up and running. UCI is working with local, state, and federal authorities to access as much emergency funding as we can as well as tapping donor bases, grants, and other sources of revenue. I hope to be able to share positive results from all of these efforts soon.

Extensions
We have gotten a lot of concerned messages about attempting to advance to candidacy or meet other deadlines in Spring quarter. Faculty from individual programs and the academic senate (Graduate Council) have control of these rules. However, a few current details may help ease some of your concerns. Summer quarter counts as part of the year you are in now. So, if you are trying to advance by end of Òthis year,Ó you are good as long as you do it by the day before fall quarter (end of September). Additionally, we have waived filing fees and many other fees for Spring and Summer quarters. We have also asked faculty to be flexible and allow for major exams of this kind in the summer if at all possible. So, this should give you a decent amount of flexibility. Obviously, we will continue to watch things, and if additional extensions become necessary, Graduate Council (faculty senate) is very much ready to take up this issue. As always, Graduate Division (my team) maintains the ability to grant extensions on an individual basis should you have specific needs. 

Research Continuity

The Office of Research has provided guidance on research continuity on their website:https://news.research.uci.edu/research-continuity/

Most research falls in one of these categories:

Critical Research: Essential experiments, COVID related research, and so on. If your work is in these categories, you may continue work. You MUST use good social distancing. If your PI is not following these guidelines, you should talk with your department chair or Associate Dean for Research.
Research that can be conducted online (or from home): You can continue to analyze data, write articles and books, do close readings, etc if you can do them from home. You can also collect new data if it can be done remotely.
Research that cannot be conducted from home and is not critical: In most cases, this work has been paused.
Regardless of what category your work falls into, you may be struggling to be Òproductive.Ó You may also find respite in the work. Either response (or both!) are completely normal. Please work with your PI, thesis advisor, department chairs, DECADE mentors, and everyone else who can help you work through this time. There are no right or wrong answers unfortunately. We also have no way to predict how any of us will be feeling in another two weeks. Do the best you can and keep communication lines open.

Finally, I just want to close by telling you what has been the hardest part of all of this for me: PATIENCE. Be patient while we wait for a cure. Be patient while we wait for a vaccine. Be patient while you wait to see if your young sonÕs dry cough is going to progress, to see if you or your husband will get whatever he has. Be patient while they restock the shelves. Be patient while you wait for your sister-in-law to file for unemployment. Be patient while you wait on hold trying to get her healthcare coverage. Be patient while your students await job interviews that have to be rescheduled. Be patient with all those projects that are now delayed because the resources have had to be diverted elsewhere. Patience. Patience. Patience. The last two weeks have felt like a year. I donÕt know about you, but I am running a bit low on it. And so each morning, I try to remind myself to have patience, with myself, with everyone else, with the universe. Some of the greatest minds for millennia have reminded us of the virtue of patience. Their words, repeated throughout each day, have helped me, and I hope they help you:
 

ÒEndurance is nobler than strength, and patience than beauty.Ó John Ruskin
ÒPatience is the key to contentment.Ó The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)
ÒPatience attracts happiness; it brings near that which is far.Ó Swahili Proverb
ÒBut if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.Ó Romans 8:25

If you are trying to conduct remote instruction from home, it is possible you may encounter internet performance problems. We wanted provide some options to help you mitigate this potential issue:

Upgrade your broadband through your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Broadband is generally the fastest, most consistently performing option for connecting to the internet. Many ISPs are providing free broadband upgrades for faculty, when asked. Contact your ISP to request this.
Come to campus and record your lectures using UCIÕs network
Campus is working on a plan to provide remote teaching classrooms for faculty who need them. More information on these classroom spaces will be coming soon.
Use your existing smartphone as a hotspot
As a last resort, you can set up your phone as a mobile hotspot and connect to it. This option is generally not as fast or reliable as broadband service, but it can work if needed. Contact your cellular phone provider and ask for a free upgrade to tethering and unlimited data, as a faculty member teaching remotely.

Irvine,29-Mar-2020,"Dear Grad Students and Post-Docs,

I hope you are getting some rest and enjoyment from this Sunday and not stressing about the quarter starting tomorrow. As a reminder, campus is encouraging instructors to use Week One of Spring quarter as a Òsoft open,Ó being lenient with deadlines, attendance, and so on. Hopefully, students will also treat instructors with grace as we all figure out this world of Emergency Distance Learning together. 

As you prepare for the start of the quarter, please note the resources and advice surrounding technology for distance collaboration, teaching, learning, and other work.

Additional Technology Resources:

As a reminder, UCI has TWO programs through which you can get access to additional technology that you might need during this time of emergency distance learning. If your need is predominantly as a student, meaning you need a laptop to TAKE classes, please use the loan program through the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning. If your need is predominantly as an employee, meaning you need a laptop to teach, grade, conduct your sponsored research, you should use the program through your hiring department. Using the correct program helps us to get the right support to the right place as quickly as possible. Any attempt to make requests that are not needed, to request from both programs at once, or to otherwise disrupt this system hurts our most vulnerable students. Please be kind to one another.

Will Unsoeld was an American mountaineer who was part of the first American expedition to summit Mount Everest. He went on to become the director of the Peace Corps in Nepal, traveled around promoting Outward Bound, and eventually became a founding faculty member at Evergreen State College in Washington State, where he focused on experiential education. A hero to many, UnsoeldÕs life and mission teach us many things. For me, it is an attention to the natural environment all around us. The quiet of this new world of social isolation has renewed my appreciation for the sunshine and flowers, and I hope that despite the stress and pain, you are enjoying these things too. Unsoeld, having conquered some of the toughest challenges in the world, also had this advice to offer about community:

ÒTake care of each other. Share your energies with the group. No one must feel alone, cut off, for that is when you do not make it.Ó

He was talking about high altitude trekking, but the same can be said for all of you, for all of us. I am so pleased by the spirit of caring and community I see all around UCI. I know that together, we can make it through this challenge. We will come out stronger on the other side.

Irvine,30-Mar-2020,"Dear UCI Students,

In our commitment to student success, especially in this unprecedented time, the university has quickly pivoted to shift to remote operations and implement emergency distance learning procedures. We are writing to share information from the UC Office of the President regarding the assessment of student tuition and fees. We understand what a difficult time this is for everyone and appreciate that students and families are navigating their financial situation amid uncertainty.

Thanks to the extraordinary commitment of the university community, students continue to earn full credit for their coursework and receive a wide variety of services. Mandatory charges - such as tuition, the student services fee, nonresident supplemental tuition, professional degree supplemental tuition and charges for self-supporting graduate professional degree programs - continue to help cover the facultyÕs delivery of instruction and other educational costs. These include substantial additional costs related to emergency distance learning, as well as the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid and remote academic advising. Given these services, the University of California has not changed its policies or practices related to refunds for these charges. UCI will comply with this guidance.

The University continues to function even as many staff and faculty are working and teaching remotely. While certain aspects of campus operations are curtailed during this transition, many of the costs associated with campus-based fees continue, and new costs have been incurred during this time. The debt owed for student buildings and facilities and our need to maintain campus infrastructure continue despite the current crisis. The campus is now incurring additional costs, such as laptop rentals and other emergency distance learning related needs. Although we have converted to a remote learning environment, students remain on campus, and certain services, such as Student Health and the FRESH Basic Needs Hub have become even more important to maintain for those who are still here.

If you have concerns or need support, we are here to help. Please reach out to the following offices with your individual concerns:

Financial Aid - visit www.ofas.uci.edu or email finaid@uci.edu

Irvine,1-Apr-2020,"To All Members of the UC Irvine Community:

As a campus, UC Irvine has taken critical steps to protect our community and prevent continued spread of the COVID-19 virus. These steps have included following directives from federal, state and University leadership to stay home, avoid crowds, and promote social distancing. These are all vitally important actions for us to take at this time.

UCI CARE, Faculty and Staff Support Services, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) and UCIPD collectively recognize that staying at home and experiencing social isolation can create additional risk and may be dangerous for some members of our community, especially those experiencing relationship or family violence. Concerns about virus transmission introduce new tactics that may be used to impose control or manipulate a partner, and social distancing restrictions may create additional challenges related to safety, health, and confidentiality. External factors such as economic and health insecurity can add stress and create circumstances that further compromise safety.

UCI takes reports of sexual and domestic violence seriously and responds promptly and effectively to reports of such conduct. We are committed to continuing to support our UCI students, staff, and faculty who are affected by sexual violence or quarantined at home with an abuser. All services continue to be available, including assistance with workplace, academic, and housing accommodations.

Everyone can play a role: our campus community practices bystander intervention. We encourage those who are able to do so safely to continue practicing bystander intervention. Thank you for your partnership in creating a safe and harassment-free community.

Finally, sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited by law and by university policy. All employees, unless they are specifically designated by policy as confidential employees, are Responsible Employees and are required to report such incidents to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.

In support of our campus community, we have compiled the following list of resources to offer support and assistance for those in need:

UCI Remote Resources:

CARE provides free and confidential support services to all members of the UCI community (students, staff, faculty and affiliates) affected by sexual assault, relationship abuse, family violence and/or stalking. During limited campus operations, secure and confidential CARE Advocacy services continue to be available remotely. CARE staff are able to provide updated information about changes to court schedules, forensic exams and community resources. Advocacy services may include answering questions, providing information about rights and options, supportive measures that promote safety and well-being (for example: academic, employment or housing changes), virtual accompaniment to interviews and appointments, safety planning, financial support, and referrals to other services and resources. Video and phone appointments may be made by calling the CARE office at (949) 824-7273 or by email atcare@uci.edu. Additional information, as well as resources to support healing or coping, can be found at care.uci.edu and on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Irvine,2-Apr-2020,"To the UC community:

We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time.

The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together.

Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time.

To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus.

To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time.

To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID-19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible.

While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary.

Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together.",446,cal,4

Irvine,6-Apr-2020,"Dear colleagues, 

I could not be more proud to be an Anteater. It is a time of great stress as we care for our first COVID-19 patients and prepare for the apex of the curve in just a few short weeks. Our front-line caregivers, and all those who are helping friends and neighbors in the community, are standing together in service. They are not alone in this fight. Faculty, staff and students from every part of UCI are devoting their time and creativity. This is the true power of an academic medical center where taking care of others, especially the most vulnerable among us, is bolstered by the innovative inquiry and nimble responsiveness of a modern research university. Of the scores of examples, I will share a few today.



Ventilators are needed to care for many hospitalized COVID-19 patients but there are not enough across the United States to care for the large numbers of patients with respiratory failure admitted during surge conditions. To address the need, UCI Health otolaryngologist Dr. Brian Wong and anesthesiologist Dr. Govind Rajan partnered with Tom Milner, acting director of the Beckman Laser Institute & Medical Clinic, to design and build what they call a ÒbridgeÓ ventilator that is an inexpensive, quick-to-manufacture device for intensive care units that have employed all their standard ventilators. It is now under review by the FDA.

There is an urgent need to develop effective therapies to treat active disease in COVID-19 patients. At UCI, Dr. Alpesh Amin, chair of the Department of Medicine, and Dr. Lanny Hsieh, a specialist in infectious diseases, are leading a clinical trial of the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Remdesivir is considered promising because it has previously been tested in humans with Ebola and has shown promise in animal models for treating MERS and SARS, which are also coronavirus diseases that emerged in 2012 and 2002, respectively. The randomized, placebo-controlled trial will provide the clinical data required to assess the effectiveness of the medication and side-effects.

The COVID-19 virus binds to cell surface proteins where they are processed by host proteases and this allows the virus to enter and hijack the internal cellular pathways in order to replicate and emerge in greater numbers. UCI chemistry professor Rachel Martin,  an expert in understanding how proteins function in living organisms, and her research team are working to develop a protease inhibitor that will prevent cellular  infection at its very first step. This approach has succeeded against previous viruses, including HIV, so it bears great promise. Other faculty across UCI are looking at each step from binding to release, developing molecular models, performing chemical syntheses, and creating new tests, and reaching out to work together to move projects forward quickly. 

Another critical need is for personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect healthcare providers on the front lines. UCI medical students kicked off a supply drive to help healthcare workers this week. The drive was organized by Jaspal Bassi, who received the help of more than 45 other medical students in this effort. The collection of these supplies will repeat every Saturday in April in the parking lot next to the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute on the UCI campus. In addition to PPE and sanitizer that are needed in the coming weeks, the medical students are helping to ease the burden on caregivers by walking dogs, babysitting and grocery shopping. Kudos to Jaspal and his fellow students.

On a related note, the faculty on campus have been scouring their labs and workspaces for PPE to donate to the medical center. They have also done a terrific job Ð and we are all very grateful.

Finally, let me share a preview of something that is happening next week. Faculty from the Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering have led an interdisciplinary team in the development, testing and production of a face shield that not only meets the necessary medical form, fit and functional requirements identified by hospital staff, but is inexpensive enough to be disposed after each patient interaction, the primary request from clinicians. Medical staff tested the prototypes to ensure that health system requirements were met. Upon that success, full-scale production began, and what started out as a small-scale 3D printing production of parts and assembly was transformed into a robust production operation at the University Partner Lab at UCI Beall Applied Innovation. It is expected that a first shipment of 5,000 masks will be delivered to the medical center in a few days.

These are a few compelling demonstrations of the unique strengths of UCI and the tripartite mission of health affairs -- to discover, to teach and to heal -- and the seamless synergy we enjoy across the university from our undergraduate classrooms to our ICUs. The mission is also a bond that brings together the best minds to deliver leading-edge healthcare to Orange County, the state of California, and to the nation. Innovation is in our DNA.

In closing, I want to congratulate Chad Lefteris on his appointment as CEO of UCI Health. We have worked together for well more than a year, and I want to share my confidence that Chad is just the right person to lead UCI Health now through this COVID-19 crisis, ensuring that our frontline caregivers have the tools and resources they need to provide exemplary care during the pandemic, and also in the future as a critical member of the health affairs leadership team that is bringing patient-centered, team-based, integrative healthcare to the nation.",928,cal,4
Irvine,6-Apr-2020,"Happy Monday everyone,

We donÕt have a huge update today. Apparently, the rain kept away the news. Hopefully, you all got to jump in a few puddles today or cuddle up on the couch under a blanket. As for me, my home office is a closet (literally) with no windows, and so for a brief moment I thought we had a rat infestation on the roof, but no it was just raindrops.

A few things to draw your attention to as we continue to respond to this new normal. Please attend to issues of accessibility in your research, teaching, and correspondence.

Accessibility During COVID-19
In Accessibility Suffers During Pandemic, Inside Higher Ed describes how students with disabilities and their advocates worry about access to equitable education. Our Disability Services Center has been working around the clock to ensure our students have appropriate access. Please reach out to them if you need help, can volunteer to help others, or have questions.

Microsoft also published an interesting article, What the disability community can teach us about working remotely, in which they describe working with and learning from their employees and by continuing to prioritize accessibility in these shifting circumstances. Microsoft has been a leader in inclusive hiring and work practices. It is nice to see them continuing to do so.

Irvine,6-Apr-2020,"Summary: Check in with yourself, marshal your coping strategies, and reach out to campus resources during this challenging time.


Dear Anteaters:

I write from my front porch, where a warm sunshine and a gentle breeze remind me that spring arrived a short while ago, right around the time we were packing up residence halls and offices. I didn't take the time to notice this seasonal transition as we began imagining what it was going to be like to learn, work, and socialize from a distance, and so I'm doing so now. I'm also taking stock of what has grown lately, around me as well as within me: my capacity to cope with uncertainty, my tolerance for the unknown, and my knowledge of technology.

In order to acknowledge the growth that can occur after a trauma or dramatic change (often referred to as post-traumatic growth), it's important to notice the event(s) that prompted that growth. COVID-19 has been that event for all of us, thrusting us into a new normal, and life has changed in large and small ways for us all. I'd like to invite us all to take a moment and simply acknowledge this change as we find a path forward.

For many of us, it has been a difficult transition, and we cannot ignore that this period has been challenging for the world, our nation, and for members of our very own community. At the same time that we have been presented with new opportunities to turn inward, spend time with loved ones, and use technology in exciting new ways to stay connected, these first weeks have been, for many, characterized by uncertainty, anxiety, fear, or sadness. We have lost some of our routines. Some of us have had to confront economic uncertainty, as well, prioritizing essential expenses, scaling down, or realizing how we can mobilize our resources to help others who are experiencing difficult circumstances. A colleague refers to these sorts of challenges as ""character-builders,"" and I would say that we have had no shortage of those over the weeks.

We cannot cope with what we don't acknowledge or notice, so as you begin this new spring term, I encourage you to spend some time noticing. Give space to the grief, frustration, or loss that you might be feeling. Notice how this feels in your body. What has this loss done to your appetite, ability to sleep, or ability to connect with others? In what ways are you or are people in your life a little more short-tempered, anxious, or angrier, and how can we be more compassionate to ourselves and to others during this time? What have you learned about yourself as the seasons have changed? How has this pause created new opportunities to connect with friends and neighbors, regenerate your energy, or appreciate those aspects of your life that we are sometimes too distracted to notice?

Then let's take several deep breaths in, allowing us to reengage those parts of our brain that often get hijacked during high-stress situations. We're going to need a lot of collective deep breaths during this time of uncertainty. Although we look forward to the future when we can resume portions of our normal lives, we are going to need to marshal our coping strategies now. Here are a few tips:

If it helps, keep a journal or write down what you and your family are experiencing right now. The scientific literature suggests that writing in order to better understand your emotions can have both mental and physical health benefits.

Notice the hallmarks of a good day and make a plan to repeat what worked well.

Savor something delicious, whether it's homemade, take-out, or delivered to you

Find some aspect of the arts (dance, theater, poetry, music) that inspires you.

Reach out for help if there is some aspect of telecommuting or distance learning that is unfamiliar, and try to be quick to answer a question for someone who appears to be struggling.

Keep abreast of national and local headlines, but turn media off periodically. Take time to unplug, rest, and just notice what's happening right now in this unprecedented time in our history.

Noticing allows us to marshal our coping resources. One of those coping resources might be professional help. If you find that you are noticing depression, a worsening of a pre-existing mental health condition, an unshakeable anxiety, or any other symptoms that could use a professional lens to understand, please do not hesitate to reach out to campus resources, which are available to you even if you have left campus:

I encourage students to reach out to the Counseling Center (counseling.uci.edu) by calling (949) 824-6457. During business hours (Mon-Fri 8am-5pm), to schedule an appointment or for all other inquiries, leave a message and the office will call you back within 2 hours during normal business hours. If you cannot wait to be called back within 2 hours or are calling after business hours, select option 2 to speak with a counselor by phone.

Faculty and staff can reach out to our Employee Assistance Program by calling (844) 824-3273 or accessing services at wellness.uci.edu/facultystaff/eap/introduction.html, which also links to other campus resources.

Best wishes for the spring quarter, and may the opportunities and challenges ahead prompt reflection, compassion, and the best of the human spirit.",886,cal,4
Irvine,6-Apr-2020,"HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS)
The COVID-19 crisis has put the physical collections of many research libraries out of reach, including ours. Fortunately,HathiTrust holds digital copies of many of these works. They have created an Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS), which opens up copyrighted material in the HathiTrust Digital Library to member institutions with copies of those items in their physical collections.

Millions of digitized books available through HathiTrust which are also in UC librariesÕ collections are now available online to UC students, faculty, and staff. Use your UC credentials to login to theHathiTrust Digital Library, and then check-out in copyright books for online reading access for renewable one-hour loans.

Irvine,7-Apr-2020,"To provide the necessary tools to support the rapid transition to online learning and remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most UC locations expanded their use of Zoom for teaching, research, telemedicine, and administration. Ten UC locations have obtained site licenses to provide Zoom access for all faculty, staff, and students.

As the universityÕs Chief Information Officers, we are very aware and concerned that Zoom is experiencing security and privacy issues. Our UC IT security and privacy experts are closely monitoring these issues and ZoomÕs responses.

Zoom has been quick to respond to these issues, including the timely release of security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. UC locations also have issued guidance for their users, which is found below. Such guidance will be revised as necessary, based on any new findings.

In addition, UC has a systemwide agreement in place with Zoom, which includes the UC Data Security Appendix and a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement. The terms of this agreement address UCÕs needs and provide greater security and privacy protections than ZoomÕs standard agreement terms.

Privacy and security are a joint responsibility of both Zoom and our UC communities. There are a few keys steps all of us can take to best ensure the privacy and security of our Zoom interactions:

All Zoom users should install client software updates as soon as they are available.
Zoom meeting hosts should set their accounts to provide the highest protection for the privacy of all meeting participants in accordance with their locationÕs published guidance (listed below).
All Zoom users should periodically check their locationÕs published guidance for updates.
In sum, Zoom has been responsive to the security and privacy concerns and, while it is important for our IT security and privacy experts to monitor the situation, we believe that at present Zoom continues to be an appropriate option for online learning and remote work.

Irvine,8-Apr-2020,"The impacts of the coronavirus on AmericaÕs most vulnerable communities
Richard Matthew, UCI Blum Center Faculty Director

22 years ago, I wrote an article with a colleague from Georgetown University entitled ÒSex, Drugs and Heavy Metal: Transnational Threats and National Vulnerabilities.Ó It was published in the journal Security Dialogue.

In it we argued:

The increasing degree and rate of human mobility throughout history has created an opportunity for infectious disease to spread with devastating consequences. The plagues that swept across medieval Europe, the smallpox carried to the Americas by the Spanish, and the cholera, malaria and AIDS that wreak havoc today testify to the enormous impact infectious disease can have on a vulnerable society. Today, drug resistant viruses and new pathogens uncovered as people carve their way into rainforests can be transported unintentionally across the globe in hours. The ingredients for an epidemic--including infected livestock and foodstuffs, poor hygiene, inadequate sanitation systems, drug resistant pathogens, and rapid and extensive human contact--are largely in place for a transnational catastrophe. Despite widespread recognition of these problems, recent national responses to two of the worldÕs deadliest diseases demonstrate how state-centric policies tend to inhibit appropriate preparations and responses.

We concluded that:

The state, which evolved to provide security from both domestic and external threats, is being constrained by its historical legacy as it struggles to respond to transnational security issues. We must be prepared to vanquish the next Nazi Germany, but we must also be prepared to confront the Ebola virus, mass migration, weapons proliferation, drugs, and terrorism. As new technologies unsettle traditional patterns of behavior, we must find new ways of providing for security. The challenge ahead is to adapt the state to this new environment, and devise transnational structures competent to address transnational threats.

As new technologies unsettle traditional patterns of behavior, we must find new ways of providing for security. The challenge ahead is to adapt the state to this new environment, and devise transnational structures competent to address transnational threats.

We argued for extensive global cooperation, for including new perspectives and expertise in our security thinking, and for developing institutions fully dedicated to understanding and responding to disease pandemics and similar threats.

We were certainly not alone in arguing that the United States was failing to address transnational threats posed by infectious disease, environmental change and terrorism. We were part of a noisy community of rather pessimistic researchers whose views have (too) often been ignored. Our concerns, however, have received considerable support from real world eventsÑincluding 9/11, the worst droughts, floods and fires in our history, the largest forced displacements of people since World War II, and, now, the novel coronavirus. It is sad and frustrating that some of the steps taken to realign national security with the realities of the post-Cold War era, and to build architecture around a vision of human security focused on the rights and dignity of all Americans, and of people around the world with whom we are deeply interconnected, were pushed back in ways that place ideology above science. We have been left less prepared than we could have been.

Less prepared to anticipate and respond to transnational threats, and less prepared to address another empirical reality that the dire events of the past two decades have brought into focus. Simply put: while everyone in our society suffers during these types of crisis, the poorest members of our society suffer more than everyone else. And in many ways their suffering lasts much longer.

The 78% of our population, according to a 2017 CareerBuilder report, living pay check to pay check; the 40% of our population unable, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve study, to pull together $400 in an emergency; the 40 million Americans currently living below the poverty lineÑthese people are far more likely to be displaced from housing they can just afford towards housing they really cannot afford. They are more likely to lose their jobs or take pay cuts. They are more likely to face crushing unexpected billsÑand be unable to pay themÑand have their credit ratings plummet as a result. More likely to lose their cars. More likely to have their education interrupted. More likely not to have insurance policies in place that protect them. More likely to become even more vulnerable to subsequent shocksÑlike a recession. More likely to find themselves in desperate need of assistance. And more likely to be neglected, and to enter a downward spiral that might entrap them permanently.

Our moral beliefs are clear: those with capacity have a responsibility to assist those in need. And the imperatives of prudential behavior are also clear: the welfare and safety of all are diminished when we fail to act to alleviate forms of poverty and inequality that generate despair, deepen distrust and increase volatility in our political and economic systems.

The novel coronavirus has and will continue to hurt many people in this country, and insofar as everyone is at some risk, it will do so free from Òdiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.Ó But over time it will almost certainly play out very differently in the two halves that make up America, because one half is simply far more resilient than the other. We cannot erase inequality, but we can reduce its most dangerous forms. The differential impacts of the coronavirus can be mitigated dramatically through inclusive policies, contextually sensitive interventions, targeted and adequate financial assistance, and acts of kindness and compassion. The skills and knowledge needed in this regard are the backbone of the educational programs we have designed to prepare the next generation of leaders for California, the US, the planet.

We also have created a new web page dedicated to reporting on the impacts of the coronavirus on AmericaÕs most vulnerable communities. We invite you to contributeÑyour views, stories, compelling visuals, evidence-based studies, and to help us identify resources that are available to those in need.

Irvine,10-Apr-2020,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Nucleic Acid Detection Tests
Background:
Effective immediately, the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine will be testing nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and nasal specimens collected from individuals with suspected COVID-19 infection on two additional platforms. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct are real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2. The table below highlights the differences between the 4 platforms that are now available.

Effective date: April 10, 2020                                                                                              

Important Considerations: 
For simplicity and conservation, one nasopharyngeal swab is sufficient and recommended for both COVID-19 and influenza/RSV testing if both tests are requested using the Xpert Flu kits.
Oropharyngeal and nasal swabs should be combined in one vial.
The rapid ePlex, Cepheid, and DiaSorin platforms should only be considered when fast turnaround time is required and requires approval of the designated clinical team due to limited reagent availability.
Clinical accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated.
A few published studies suggest that viral loads are highest early during the disease course (3-6 days after symptom onset)1-4
A ÒNot DetectedÓ (negative) result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. This result should be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.
Due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 propagation for laboratory personnel, viral cultures (code: CULVRS) from respiratory sources are temporally discontinued at UCI and our reference laboratories per government COVID-19 guidelines.
Turnaround time (TAT) estimates do not include order-to-collection or collection-to-receipt times.

Irvine,21-Apr-2020,"Dear Campus Community, 

UCI again experienced an incident of Zoombombing yesterday during a public lecture event. Zoombombing describes an individual or a group of individuals misusing Zoom features to interrupt a meeting or class, often with criminal, vulgar, or inappropriate images or chat messages. 

These incidents are unacceptable at UCI. If you experience Zoombombing, please report it to techprep@uci.edu. Yesterday's event was suspended immediately, and the recording was turned over to law enforcement for criminal investigation.

As COVID-19 pushes classes to remote learning environments, incidents of Zoombombing have occurred across the country. Usually, the perpetrators are seeking to spread hate and intimidate targeted communities. 

It is important to note that UCI has procedures in place to secure remote meetings, and everyone is encouraged to use them. Moreover, the campus acts to prevent and remedy the disruption of presenters, speakers, instruction and other university activities. Please see UCI's guidance for the disruption of university activities for more detailed information. 

I encourage you to visit UCI's interdisciplinary virtual workshop, Racial Violence and Restorative Engagement in a Time of Pandemic, as a resource to explore divisive issues amplified in a pandemic environment and how we can be responsive in ways that promote collaboration and understanding.

Irvine,27-Apr-2020,"Dear colleagues:

Opportunistic cybercriminals are targeting individuals and organizations with COVID-19 related attacks. These attacks come in the form of malicious ÒphishingÓ emails, SMS texts, phone apps, and websites. In many cases, their goal is to get you to click on a link, open an attachment, or install an app, that will infect your device with different types of malware (including ransomware) that will steal and/or destroy data. In other cases, the goal is to get you to divulge personal or financial information to the attacker.

COVID-19 related themes that attackers have attempted to exploit include:

Communications pretending to come from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or other health organizations
Fake online maps and tracking sites for COVID-19
Donations to charity or relief organizations
Personal protective equipment (PPE) scams
Cancelation of events
Stimulus checks
Remote work offers
Rent and mortgage relief
Common red flags to look out for include:

Suspicious email address Ð a majority of phishing emails can be spotted by looking at the senderÕs email address. If the sender address looks suspicious, it is recommended to verify if the email is legitimate. For example at UCI, if you ever receive an email with uci.edu before the Ò@Ó symbol it may be a scam. Scammers also like to create accounts on free email services like Gmail and Hotmail and set the ÒFromÓ address to the person they want to impersonate.
Generic or non-routine message Ð most of the time attackers donÕt have internal information, so their messages are very generic. These can also include unexpected Òtoo good to be trueÓ offers or asking to perform non-routine requests.
Sense of urgency Ð attackers like to take advantage of our emotions and often times create a sense of urgency to get us to respond. Particularly now when most of us are working remotely and our usual methods of interaction have changed, the authenticity of our communication is much more vulnerable.
Misspelling, typos, unfamiliar languages Ð most phishing emails are not written very well and can contain grammatical errors.
Additional phishing awareness resources are also available on the OIT Security website.

Please forward any suspicious emails that you want checked to OIT Security at spam@uci.edu.

Please email OIT Security at security@uci.edu with any other questions.",380,cal,4
Irvine,28-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

In this unprecedented time, UCI confronts a variety of digital accessibility issues. Regardless of the challenges, we stay committed to accessibility and equity, both in our work environment and in our educational mission.

We have fostered a strong partnership between the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD), and the Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation (DTEI). While each office is issuing guidance specific to their area, we wanted to provide an aggregated list of resources and an overview for those who are new to the principles of digital accessibility.

Below is information regarding policy, principles, and resources for addressing digital accessibility. Additional information can be found on the Accessibility.uci.edu website. Should you have follow-up questions about digital accessibility, please contact a member of the IT Accessibility Work Group; Meredith Ehrenberg, IT Accessibility Work Group Co-Chair; or Andrew Berk, ADA Coordinator.

We invite you to join the effort to expand UCI's inclusion of all members of our community in our digital domain.

Information Technology and Data

_Policy

The University of California IT Accessibility Policy establishes that information technology should be designed, developed, and procured to be accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies. Some key information technologies are:

websites
course materials and anything related to instruction - including syllabi
group and individual emails
interoffice memos
training materials, etc.
While we offer students an opportunity to register for services through the Disability Services Center and employees can request accommodations through their department with the assistance of Human Resources, no-one is required to disclose a disability. We should therefore assume that any digital materials that we produce may be used by a person with a disability and ensure all materials meet these guidelines to the best of our ability.

_Accessibility Principles

These quick perspective videos are a great way to familiarize yourself with some of the principles of IT Accessibility and how different users may interact with your content.

_P-O-U-R

POUR is an acronym for four high-level principles that describe functional accessibility: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Perceivable: the user can identify content and interface elements by means of the senses. For many users, this means perceiving a system primarily visually, while for others, it may be sound (read aloud by a machine) or touch (as on a Braille device).
Operable: ability to use controls, buttons, navigation, and other interactive elements. For many users, this means identifying an interface control visually, and then clicking, tapping, or swiping. For others, a computer keyboard or voice commands are required.
Understandable: consistent in presentation and format, predictable in design and usage, concise, and appropriate in voice and tone.
Robust: standards-compliant; designed to function on all appropriate platforms.
_Resources

General

Siteimprove scans websites for accessibility issues and provides periodic reports. To obtain a new account and register your site for Siteimprove, go to siteimprove.ucop.edu. From there, users can auto-provision an account using their UCInetID. Then send an email to oit@uci.edu including which site to have scanned and the user(s) who will need permission to the site.
The Accessibility website includes a library of short training videos on various topics. You can sort and filter to find recommended courses based on your role here on campus. Each video is just a few minutes long.
You can also find information on closed-captioning vendors on the Accessibility website. Note that any videos you use or promote should include captions, whether you created the video or not.
The UCOP Electronic Accessibility Testing Website provides links to software that developers can use to test their products for accessibility prior to launch.

Irvine,29-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

I am writing today to provide an update on the campus research enterprise. As you know, since March 21, 2020, we have restricted campus research to only approved critical research projects. I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the campus research community for the cooperation and sacrifice in response to the message dated March 17, 2020 calling for ramp-down and curtailment of non-critical research on-campus. Your commitment to the health and safety of the UCI and surrounding community has been immensely helpful.

As you may have seen, Governor Newsom has outlined plans for relaxing Stay-at-Home orders. In anticipation of such relaxation and reopening, I have spent the last few weeks working with the University of California Council of Vice Chancellors for Research, leaders of schools and research centers, Academic Senate Council for Research, Computing and Libraries, and campus leadership on planning for the  restart of research activities on-campus. We have made very good progress during this time and we anticipate being ready to restart, in a phased manner, on-campus research in the near future.

Since the precise dates for the restart are still to be decided, please continue to adhere to the current restrictions and conduct only the approved critical research work. I hope to be able to communicate with you soon on the research restart.",222,cal,4

Campus-Community Research Incubator Grant Program

Application Deadline: June 1, 2020

Overview

The Campus-Community Research Incubator Program (CCRI) is a small funding mechanism designed to foster collaborative research-oriented projects between university researchers and community organizations. Annually, there are two levels of grant funding available: 1. Pilot CCRI $8,000-$10,000 (for research applications) and 2. Mini CCRI $3,000-$5,000 (for capacity and partnership building applications). Additionally, this special request for applications allows for the provision of COVID-19-related community-engaged research projects up to $20,000. Potential applicants are encouraged to attend a workshop on general application preparation. A registration link for this workshop can be found below.

The estimated funding period is July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021.

All applications must be submitted electronically.

 

Eligibility

Grants are awarded only to teams comprised of UCI researchers and community organization representatives. Applicants can be:

501(c)(3) community organizations located in southern California
UCI-based researchers, including faculty, healthcare providers, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, or senior researchers
Proposals must demonstrate an active engagement between UCI researchers and community representatives. Specifically, projects must demonstrate they are co-designed and clearly state the anticipated benefits to each partner.

All projects require regulatory compliance (e.g. UCI Human Research Institutional Review Board [IRB] approval or an exemption determination, required trainings) to be met prior to funds being released. It is recommended that the IRB application be submitted prior to final submission of this funding application. In addition to UCI IRB approval, community organizations may have their own IRB processes.

All personnel on proposals must take the Human Subjects Protections and HIPAA tutorial prior to funds being disbursed.

Tutorials: Human Subject Protection and HIPAA  https://www.citiprogram.org/Default.asp 

Types of Awards

Research-based activities: Pilot CCRI $8,000-$10,000

Research activities include but are not limited to data collection, analyses, and/or pilot studies.
An example of a pilot CCRI is a study that will generate findings to be further studied or tested in a larger follow-up research study. Typically, CCRI funds are adequate to determine feasibility. Sometimes a statistically-significant sample can be obtained, but this is not an expected outcome of CCRI-funded projects. For information on the expectations and limitations of seed grant funding, please see this article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081994/
Fifty-one percent (51%) of research funds must be distributed directly to the community partner.
COVID-19-related research: Pilot CCRI $10,000-$20,000

COVID-19 partnered research projects include but are not limited to data collection, data analyses, and/or pilot studies.
Successful applications will demonstrate potential for a positive impact on our mission to understand and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and the measures taken to control the spread of the virus. Responsive applications might include interventions to address social, biological, psychological, familial, medical, or community impacts of COVID; studies to establish and/or address needs created by COVID and/or its related impact on human services and health; topics around equity and disparities in control and mitigation of the virus; surveillance and contact tracing; epidemiology; testing; or psychosocial impacts of social isolation, infection, and caregiver experience, for example.
Priority will be given to innovative questions, methods, or approaches that involve community-based participatory research methods.
Capacity- and partnership-building activities: Mini CCRI $3,000-$5,000

Capacity-building and project planning activities include but are not limited to trainings, data set organization, technology, project development for future research
Community-engaged research is a unique genre of research requiring specific skills, approaches, motivations, and methodologies. Working directly with community entities to conduct translational research often entails health equity/racial and economic health disparities interests. Addressing these social determinants of health requires sensitivity to- and understanding of the unique contextual circumstances driving equity disparities within specific populations. In turn, this type of research requires investment in developing relationships and trust within communities, with an eye toward long-term collaborative work. Given the specialized nature of community-engaged research, we feel it is important to communicate clearly the mission, goals, and requirements for this request for proposals and have, therefore created workshops for faculty and community researchers to learn more details on application preparation, as well as provide an opportunity for questions and answers to be addressed. 
We strongly encourage all potential applicants to attend one of these workshops. Workshops are scheduled for May, and registration can be made at the link below.

Use of Funds

Three funding levels are anticipated for this round:

COVID-19 $10,000-$20,000 (research applications)
Pilot CCRI $8,000-$10,000 (for research applications)
Mini CCRI $3,000-$5,000 (for capacity and partnership building applications)

Funds may be used to purchase research supplies, support research assistants, or buy out an applicant's time.

At least 51% of award funds must be distributed to the community partner to support their research activities. Community partner funds may also be used to supplement academic partnerÕs project activities, if necessary.

Awardees are required to acknowledge the ICTS in all publications and presentations.
Selection Criteria

Awards will be made competitively. In general, proposals that demonstrate the following will be given highest priority:

Focus on integrating innovative community-based practices that accelerate discoveries toward better health and healthcare delivery and/or contribute to the understanding of clinical translational science and the social determinants of health.
Have formed or established a partnership (an existing partnership prior to applying for CCRI). Partnership development and fortification are a primary mission for this grant mechanism, so a special emphasis on the nature of the academic-community partnership should be apparent.
Demonstrate project ingenuity/innovation.
Have a high likelihood of meaningful positive impact (ex. changing clinical care in a positive way, future research possibilities).
We will preferentially consider proposals with in-kind support.
Those with existing IRB approval.

Irvine,8-May-2020,"To All Members of the UC Irvine Community:

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Education issued Title IX final rules mandating how universities across the country respond to complaints of sexual harassment starting in August 2020.

The University of California's policies and procedures largely comply with the final rules, and there will be system-wide discussions regarding any necessary modifications in the weeks ahead. The UC system has publicly expressed concerns about a few key provisions in the rules, including the proposed definition of sexual harassment and the regulations surrounding cross-examination in hearings.

In the UC President's statement on Wednesday, President Janet Napolitano made clear that the UC system will continue working to ensure that our response to sexual harassment and sexual violence reports is prompt and equitable, emphasizing that the University of California ""remains steadfast in our commitment to our students and community and will respond to the rules with care and thoughtfulness.""

At UCI, our leadership takes proactive steps to address sexual harassment and provide services and resources for those impacted. That will not change. We remain committed to ensuring that students, staff, and faculty are able to participate in their education and employment free of sexual harassment. 

If you would like additional information, a compilation of resources follows this message. Feel free to contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity with questions and concerns.

Los Angeles,23-Jan-2020,"To the UCLA Community, As we approach the peak of the flu season, many of you may be experiencing flu-like symptoms or the common cold.  In addition, you may have come across news reports about a similar respiratory illness from Wuhan, China, called the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. While incidences of the common cold or the flu may be on the rise, we want to reassure the UCLA community that at this time, there are no known exposures to 2019-nCoV on campus. Additionally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to people in North America is considered low. We would also like to remind the Bruin community that there are simple precautions one can take to minimize the risk of contracting or spreading any respiratory viral illnesses. Those include regular hand-washing, coughing and sneezing into one’s sleeves, and staying up-to-date on immunizations and flu shots. The UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health Center and UCLA Health infectious disease specialists recommend that any student experiencing a cough and a fever who has also recently traveled to Wuhan, or who has had contact with people from Wuhan with symptoms, call the center at (310) 206-6217. Students must call before showing up. UCLA faculty and staff in the same situation should contact their primary health care provider. Both the Arthur Ashe Student Health Center and the UCLA Health hospitals are well-prepared to care for patients with infectious diseases. UCLA is also working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and state and county public health officials to keep our campus healthy, and to keep you informed of significant new developments.

Los Angeles,4-Feb-2020,"Dear Colleagues: UCLA has developed a review and approval process to provide guidance to faculty and staff considering travel to China, in light of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. This comes as the U.S Department of State last week raised its travel advisory for China to its maximum level, urging U.S. citizens not to travel there due to the public health concerns posed by 2019-nCoV. Commercial airlines have also reduced or suspended routes to and from China, and late last week University of California President Janet Napolitano requested all UC campuses to temporarily “avoid all non-essential travel” to China (PDF). The UC Office of the President also asked all UC campuses to develop a review and approval process to determine whether travel to China is essential or can be postponed. While the UC restrictions apply only to university-related travel, those traveling for personal reasons should be mindful of travel risks and the federal government’s advisory. UCLA faculty and staff may send questions to info@irm.ucla.edu, a dedicated email account that is monitored by the UCLA Office of Insurance and Risk Management, and the central point of contact for questions about UCLA-related China travel restrictions specifically. APPROVAL PROCESS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF PRIOR TO TRAVEL In light of UC’s directive to avoid all non-essential travel, faculty or staff who would like to engage in essential travel to China will need to obtain prior approval. For faculty, essential travel is defined as that which is required to: preserve the safety of a research subject and which is not possible to be postponed; or preserve the results of a research activity and which is not possible to be postponed. Please be aware that educational conferences are not considered essential travel, even if you are a presenter. This is just one example of non-essential travel and does not include all other activities that would also be considered non-essential travel. To request approval to engage in essential travel, faculty should contact their deans in writing for approval. For staff: All staff must request an exemption as university-related staff travel to China is presumed postponable and therefore non-essential. To request an exception, staff should contact their department’s vice chancellor in writing. Such an exemption may only be approved by a vice chancellor.

UCLA will continue to provide you with the most reliable and up-to-date information possible on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) information page on UCLA Newsroom. We are also planning some upcoming forums to share information about our planning and preparedness, particularly for our students. Communities thrive when we all stay committed to each other’s well-being. We must never stigmatize anyone in our community based on national origin. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have COVID-19. Science and common sense remain our best tools for successfully addressing this situation. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor",396,cal,3
Los Angeles,4-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: As you may have seen, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced this morning that there are additional confirmed cases of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Los Angeles County. Given this news, I wanted to provide continued updates knowing this may cause anxiety among our Bruin community. First, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UCLA at this time. Second, we are working quickly to expand the use of existing remote teaching and learning tools available, by reaching out to faculty to offer technology support. These tools will include the ability to stream lectures via Zoom or BruinCast, create collaborative online spaces via Slack or UCLA Common Collaboration and Learning Environment (CCLE) and provide opportunities for remote test taking, if needed. There will be a separate message to faculty with more details. Also, we will begin to offer in-person informational meetings, starting today. Understanding that there is a lot of news and misinformation regarding COVID-19, we will host community meetings during which attendees can hear the facts about COVID-19 from medical experts, understand UCLA’s procedures for handling different scenarios and have an open forum to ask questions. We will hold these in-person informational meetings at various locations on campus, including on the Hill. Information concerning these meetings will be listed on the COVID-19 information page on UCLA Newsroom. For departments interested in coordinating a small group meeting, please contact UCLA Campus Human Resources at 310-794-0860. And lastly, as I shared in my message earlier this week, the best steps you can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include washing your hands frequently, containing coughs into a tissue or sleeve and staying home if you are sick, especially if you have a respiratory illness and fever. If you develop flu-like symptoms  fever, cough and difficulty breathing  and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. As always, emergency preparedness information can be found at Bruins Safe Online. We will continue to communicate regularly on this important topic. I know concerns may be high, and please know that the health and safety of our Bruin community is our top priority. I thank you for taking care of yourselves and each other. Sincerely, Gene D.

Los Angeles,5-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: We are writing to share updated travel guidance, given that the prevalence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States and internationally is changing rapidly. For international travel: UCLA prohibits official university travel to all regions with Level 3 Travel Warnings for coronavirus from the CDC: mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. We strongly discourage personal travel to jurisdictions with Level 3 Travel Warnings. Any traveler arriving from these areas must self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left that country, in accordance with new guidance from the CDC. (This provision is retroactive to the last 14 days.) These requirements will also be imposed for any region the CDC raises to Level 3 for the coronavirus in the coming weeks. UCLA discourages all other nonessential international travel for now. If you decide to travel, be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. If you need to travel internationally: Consider obtaining travel insurance through the UC Office of the President Travel Insurance website or the provider of your choice. Stay informed about developments in your destination by monitoring the travel guidance provided by the CDC. Make sure your family and friends are aware of your plans and how to reach you. For domestic travelers: Use caution and judgment before any domestic travel, and check for the latest information before your trip. For large conferences and events: We are following the guidance of health officials and there is currently no recommendation to avoid attending large conferences on campus. However, we still urge you to use caution and judgment if you decide to attend large conferences. For incoming visitors to campus: Any visitor arriving to campus from a Level 3 jurisdiction (currently mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran), must also follow the CDC guidelines to self-isolate for 14 days since the date they left that country. This also applies to visitors who have been invited to campus by UCLA groups and programs. UCLA is taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Examples include: Installing hand sanitizer stations across campus, and in university-provided housing and dining area entries and on BruinBuses Cleaning restrooms and public areas with anti-viral, anti-bacterial chemical solutions Increasing frequency of cleaning in residential and dining area high-touch surfaces Employing electrostatic sprayer systems in high-use areas to disinfect around curved and hard-to-reach surfaces We want to reiterate that you can prevent the spread of COVID-19 by taking other precautions like washing your hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds, containing coughs into a tissue or sleeve, and staying home if you are sick, especially if you have a respiratory illness and fever. If you develop flu-like symptoms fever, cough and difficulty breathing and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. We encourage you to visit the COVID-19 information page on UCLA Newsroom, which is frequently updated with the latest guidance and resources. As always, emergency preparedness information and resources can be found at Bruins Safe Online. We will continue to work closely with public health officials and provide updates and community information sessions. Please also remember that UCLA is an inclusive and welcoming community, and we must not stigmatize anyone based on appearance or national origin. We recognize that there are concerns among the campus community and we remain grateful for the calm and thoughtful manner in which Bruins are caring for themselves and each other.

Los Angeles,6-Mar-2020,"We learned tonight that three UCLA students are being tested for COVID-19 by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH). All three students are self-isolating off campus. To be clear, no one on the UCLA campus has tested positive for COVID-19. LACDPH has committed to expediting these tests for UCLA. As soon as we learn the results, we will inform you of any campus impacts. Understandably, some of you may be wondering about the status of classes and campus operations in general. We are actively monitoring and responding to the situation and will continue to follow the guidance of public health agencies. At this time, there have been no recommendations by LACDPH to suspend campus operations, including modifying class schedules. While situations like these often create uncertainty and concern, please be assured that the safety and well-being of the entire UCLA community remains our top priority, and we will continue to provide you with the most reliable and up-to-date information possible on UCLA’s COVID-19 website.

Los Angeles,6-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues: In preparation for possible transition of classes to alternative delivery modalities as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, we want to share with you some tools that are available to support academic continuity. UCLA has invested in additional software licenses and other technology that will aid you and your students to continue your instruction and learning. Please anticipate and prepare for the possibility that you may have to provide alternatives for access to lectures, discussion sections, office hours, remaining assignments, and final exams. A campus working group, chaired by Special Assistant for Online Initiatives and Professor of History Jan Reiff, has developed a resource document to assist faculty, including Geffen Academy teachers, to move instruction to an online environment should classes be disrupted by the impacts of COVID-19. While it does not cover all circumstances, nor does it apply to all classes, it does provide potential solutions to situations that might arise. The tools will also be available during the Spring quarter or during other circumstances when you or your students may not be able to attend class in person. Some of the tools we recommend include: Zoom, to let your students watch your lectures in real time, participate in discussion sections and review sessions, and work with other members of their project teams. We have procured additional licenses and made it easier to download the application and set it up. A limited number of laptops and iPads are available to loan to faculty who do not currently have equipment that supports Zoom or other online collaboration tools, and are not able to obtain them through their department or borrow from a colleague. BruinCast, to video stream and/or audio podcast regularly scheduled undergraduate lectures. UCLA Common Collaboration and Learning Environment (CCLE), to create class and collaboration websites where you can store course materials, assignments, and more. Respondus, to allow you to conduct your exams online. If you know that you have students in your class who require accommodation, please email contact@online.ucla.edu. We will provide you with solutions to meet those requirements or direct you to the individuals on campus who can answer your questions. Finally, if you are sick, please follow campus advice and call your health care provider to see if you should self-quarantine or make arrangements to be tested. If you are unable to come to campus, notify your department chair and communicate your absence to your TAs and students. If you are not sick, plan for the situation that some of your students might be unable to come to campus because they are ill or quarantined.

Los Angeles,10-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: Like many of you, I have been carefully following news about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We have been working around the clock with other campus leaders and public health officials to consider how it has and could continue to impact our students, faculty and staff and developing plans for every possible scenario. While there are no confirmed cases at UCLA at this time, I believe that it is important for communities to look out for one another and to do what is best for our global and UCLA communities. This is why, after detailed and thoughtful discussion, consultation with experts, and planning and preparation, we have decided to enact the following changes to limit the spread of COVID-19, effective tomorrow, March 11: We will suspend in-person classes wherever possible and transition to online platforms through April 10, which is the end of the second week of Spring Quarter. Winter Quarter final exams will be offered remotely. Instructors are asked to communicate with students how final exams, if applicable, will be offered without the need to assemble in person (for example, take home, online or other alternative formats). Students are encouraged to start the Spring Quarter remotely from home. University housing will remain open through Spring Break and beyond for those who need it. We’re transitioning over the next few days to cancel nonessential gatherings of more than 100 people. Campus remains open, including housing, hospitals, clinics and research laboratories. We will be in touch before April 10 as facts change and we reevaluate these plans. If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, reach out to your department chair or dean. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, building on our plan for academic continuity. If you are an employee, please contact your manager and further guidance will be forthcoming. Please continue to check UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website for updates. I know this raises a lot of questions about courses, like performance courses, that are difficult to teach remotely and, for our staff who support campus operations, what their roles will look like. We understand there will be questions around many issues. Please be assured that answers and additional information will be forthcoming over the next few days. Our new policy regarding nonessential in-person events with more than 100 people will mean that organizers must work toward canceling conferences and large events through April 10. Attendance at all UCLA Athletics home events will be largely spectator-free through April 10 and limited to individuals essential to safely and effectively managing events. I know these changes may cause some stress and uncertainty. Please bear with us while we manage this complicated transition. Counseling services are available for students through UCLA’s Counseling and Psychological Services. Staff and faculty may seek services at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. If you develop flu-like symptoms — fever, cough and difficulty breathing  and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. Students: I know you will miss your friends and all of the activities you enjoy on campus. I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation, flexibility and academic integrity during this time. Please read more online about resources available to you. Faculty: I know these transitions will require you to transform how you deliver instruction and conduct final exams. Please know that we will work to provide the support and training you need to make this change as smooth as possible. Watch the Academic Senate homepage for further guidance. Staff: Please work with your supervisors to be flexible in these uncertain times and know that additional information about business continuity will be provided. You can find the UC Office of the President updated leave policy (PDF) online. And, finally, for our entire community, please also remember that COVID-19 is clearly going to disrupt and change our schedules, habits and lives for the foreseeable future. This will not be a perfect transition; however, it will not change who we are and what we do. It will also never compromise UCLA’s impact in our community and the broader world. How we react and work together in times like these help define who we are, and I have no doubt that the Bruin community will once again rise to the occasion as we transition to our second century. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor",760,cal,3
Los Angeles,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Student Employees: As a follow up to Tuesday’s memo from Chancellor Block regarding UCLA’s transition to remote instruction through, at minimum, April 10 due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we want to share leave policies and other support services that are available to employees, including the option of remote work. Our decision to make these dramatic shifts was motivated by our concerns for everyone’s safety. The best way to limit the spread of COVID-19 or any contagious disease, according to health experts, is to reduce community density. Remaining six feet away from others, wherever possible, can help prevent infections transmitted by an uncovered cough or sneeze and also by touching a contaminated surface. UCLA’s decision to transition to remote classes, postpone or cancel large events and reduce the number of people in dining facilities and residential buildings will help reduce the risk of the virus spreading on campus and in the broader community. Employees should remain home if they are sick to protect themselves and their colleagues. As always, we encourage you to be mindful of employees’ health needs. While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the UCLA campus at this time, we are committed to the safety and welfare of our employees and hope this administrative guidance will be useful to departments and organizations as we all work to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Campus Remains Open Even though classes are transitioning to remote learning temporarily, the campus remains open for students unable to return home. It is important to keep in mind that research, health care, remote learning support, as well as business and operational support functions, will continue. Recognizing we are undergoing an immense transition in the way we currently deliver educational services, this requires that all of us work together through this period of change and uncertainty. Remote Work Provisions As campus remains open, we need to maintain business continuity to support campus needs, particularly during transitional periods. Departments are encouraged to develop business continuity plans that will identify where remote work opportunities are operationally feasible. UCLA Telecommuting Guidelines are helpful in understanding the review and approval process for employees and managers to follow. Some employees can telecommute, others could telecommute if equipment is available and others cannot telecommute given their job functions. Respective deans, vice provosts and vice chancellors are responsible for ensuring business continuity and approval of plans that involve telecommuting. We know there are going to be varied outcomes for staff based on these departmental business continuity plans. For example, most if not all health care workers and direct services employees will need to be on campus. Additionally, the way in which departments implement their plans could change day to day or week to week, depending on shifting conditions and departmental needs. These are unprecedented times, so we greatly appreciate your flexibility and understanding. The University has enacted the following temporary actions for leave if an employee is directly impacted by COVID-19: Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g., sick leave, PTO-sick or other accrued leave). If there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances, and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-19 day-care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if their department determines that it is operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use all available leave balances, including sick leave and vacation. Departments may designate certain positions to work from home if operationally feasible. If employees are approved to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work, as determined by the department in consultation with Employee & Labor Relations, may be allowed up to 14 days of paid administrative leave. (Health care workers are considered exempt from this category of designation; please contact UCLA Health Human Resources for further information.) Academic appointees who do not accrue sick and/or vacation leave and who are not otherwise eligible for paid medical leave under applicable provisions of the Academic Personnel Manual will receive up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover absences as described above. (Please contact the Academic Personnel Office for questions regarding academic appointees.) Leave Provisions Additional information regarding applicable leave provisions may be found within the Absence from Work policy (PPSM 2.210) (PDF) that applies to eligible policy-covered staff employees (SMG, MSP and PSS) who may be impacted, including probationary employees. Catastrophic Leave Sharing Program UCLA’s Catastrophic Leave Program is an option for employees who have exhausted their paid leave. It is also available to those staff members who may want to donate vacation hours for others who may need them. Employee Assistance Program Dealing with uncertain situations such as COVID-19 can take a serious toll on all of us. We would like to remind you that the professionals at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for student employees are available to help employees deal with the impact of these circumstances. Pre K-12 Education Please note that the UCLA Lab School and the Geffen Academy are transitioning to alternative teaching and learning. The Early Care and Education programs and centers will remain open and will operate on limited schedules until further notice. You may contact each school or program directly for further information. Travel for Staff and Faculty Effective immediately, all nonessential university-related international and domestic travel is suspended until further notice. Personal international and domestic travel is strongly discouraged given the associated risks of possibly being unable to return if the situation changes. The CDC has recently updated their travel warnings as the spread of COVID-19 continues. Travelers returning from countries designated Level 3 by the CDC are subject to 14-day self-quarantine upon return. If you decide to travel, please be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. To request approval to engage in essential travel, faculty should contact their deans in writing for approval. Similarly, all staff must request an exemption from their vice chancellors in writing. For more information on UCLA travel and other updates, please visit the UCLA COVID-19 page and emergency updates and resources are always available at Bruins Safe Online. During this challenging transitional period, staff plays a critical role in supporting the campus community. We are so grateful for the incredible work of our employees, especially during these difficult times. We also appreciate your continued understanding and flexibility. Our employees should monitor their own health with heightened awareness and stay home if they are sick. The options mentioned above are designed to help keep the entire UCLA community safe and should be used by employees when needed. Please distribute this information to units within your purview. Sincerely, Michael J. Beck Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael S. Levine Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel",1260,cal,3
Los Angeles,13-Mar-2020,"As you may have seen on my Twitter account a short time ago, I wanted to let you know that I am self-quarantining at home for the next 14 days after learning this morning that I came in contact with an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19. While I am currently asymptomatic and continuing my duties running the campus from home, I felt it was important to keep the UCLA community aware and informed. I will continue to keep you updated. As testing for COVID-19 in the United States becomes more widely available, we will see local health centers administer more tests. As a result, we should prepare ourselves to expect the number of self-quarantine cases, like mine, and confirmed cases to increase in the weeks and months ahead  not only across the nation, but also at UCLA. I know there are many of you who are or will be in similar situations. Please know that the entire Bruin community supports you. I know these are uncertain times and many things are changing. Please know that all of our actions are aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 to keep one another safe. Please continue to check UCLA’s COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online regularly for updates. We must always commit to preparation rather than panic. We must also look out for one another, even while we are asked to be apart.

Los Angeles,13-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: By this time, you have seen the announcement from Chancellor Block about new campus measures designed to help limit the risk of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on campus. We appreciate your patience as we work thoughtfully to make decisions and adjustments to address the impact of this international public health crisis. Based on the rapidly developing situation and new data every day, we have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely through the end of the spring quarter. As stated by the chancellor, we want to reduce population density on campus because public health officials tell us that this is the best way to limit the spread of COVID-19. To that end, we have encouraged students who can return home to do so, and to take all of their personal items, if possible, from their university-owned housing with them. We also know there are a number of students who will remain on campus and in the local area. Housing and Residential Life will be following up with students who live in university-owned housing with more specific information, including how to request an early contract termination and seek a refund. If, in the meantime, students have concerns or questions, please email Housing directly at uclahousing@housing.ucla.edu. We recognize that there will be courses with specialized equipment or field work that may not be able to be conducted remotely, and more specific information will be shared in the coming days. Also, students on the semester system and/or in clinical programs will receive additional information from their schools/departments. Because remote learning will continue through spring quarter, we ask all faculty and students to familiarize themselves with remote technology features such as Zoom during spring break. Our priority during this crisis is to protect the health and safety of our campus community. Please know that the campus remains open and we are doing everything we can to create a safe environment. This includes deploying hand sanitizer stations and surface wipes across campus, increasing the frequency of cleanings, modifying dining operations and frequently updating the campus community. Our libraries, computer labs, ASUCLA operations and University offices remain open. The facts related to COVID-19 are changing rapidly, so routinely check with UCLA information sources for updates. The most up-to-date information can be found online at UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website and emergency updates and resources are always available at Bruins Safe Online. What follows are answers to some general questions, and an overview of services as we transition to a remote learning environment. Students Is the campus closed? No. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus units, including University-owned housing, the Arthur Ashe Student Health Center, UCLA Recreation, Counseling and Psychological Services, and ASUCLA dining facilities will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified. We will continue to provide updated information. What about classes and exams? We have suspended in-person classes, wherever possible, and are transitioning to remote platforms. Winter and spring quarter finals will be offered remotely; instructors have been asked to communicate with students regarding final examinations. If you are concerned about your ability to participate in remote classes or exams, please contact the Dean of Students Office at 310-825-3894 or dean@saonet.ucla.edu. Should I leave campus? If students are able to leave campus and continue studies remotely, please do so. However, if students remain on campus or live in the local area, University facilities will remain open. How quickly do I need to remove my belongings from campus housing if I leave? Personal items may remain in campus housing through the end of spring quarter or your housing contract term. Students who wish to cancel their housing contracts early will need to remove their personal belongings prior to that cancellation. Will I get to terminate my housing and dining contracts early and receive a prorated refund for spring quarter? Yes, students who choose to terminate their contracts before the end of the spring quarter will receive a prorated refund. The process for requesting termination of contracts early will be shared. What if I stay on campus or in the local area? We know that some students, for a number of reasons, may remain on campus or stay in the local area. We will continue to serve those students, even if some services are modified. What if I have an on-campus job? The campus remains open, and student positions will continue to be available, although the work may be modified based on the changing needs of the campus. You should speak with your supervisor to discuss your schedule and get more information. What if I experience a loss of wages?

Be sure to have your Bruin Card with you for overnight studying privileges. UCLA Library expects to resume regular hours on Friday, March 20, 2020. Will my F1 or J1 visa be affected by classes going online? No. The Departments of State and Homeland Security have approved exceptions that will accommodate online course engagement for students attending institutions that have made COVID-19 adaptations. The Dashew Center will continue maintenance of valid immigration status for students who maintain full-time enrollment (undergraduate students: minimum of 12 units; graduate students: minimum of 8 units) despite the transition to online instruction.

Departments are encouraged to develop business continuity plans that will identify where remote work opportunities are operationally feasible. Read more in this message to all staff. What if I cannot come to work because I or a family member has COVID-19? The University has enacted temporary actions for leave if an employee is directly impacted by COVID-19. Read more in this message to all staff. Will counseling services be available? Yes, the professionals at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center are available to help employees deal with the impact of these circumstances. Travel Guidance for Faculty, Staff and Students Please know that all UCLA nonessential international and domestic travel is suspended until further notice and personal international and domestic travel is strongly discouraged. Anyone arriving from CDC Level 3 countries must self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left that country. If you decide to travel, be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. There are no current restrictions on domestic travel, but you should be aware of preventative measures as you travel domestically. We need all Bruins to remain flexible during this time of transition. We want to thank all of you for taking care of yourselves and each other. Sincerely, Emily A.

Los Angeles,14-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the UCLA campus at this time, however, in anticipation of possible community spread, UCLA has suspended in-person classes and transitioned to remote learning platforms through the end of spring quarter. Visit the UCLA COVID-19 site for more information. The focus of this communication is to provide additional guidance regarding your research activities. With the ongoing concern about the spread of COVID-19, laboratories and research facilities should plan for the possibility of significant disruptions in routine operations. Each laboratory or research facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan that will meet its unique needs. This guidance is provided to facilitate the development of your plan, but is not intended to be all-inclusive; it is based on what is known at this time. I will update the research community as the situation develops and more information becomes available. Research Continuity Guidance for Physical Laboratories and Research Facilities Assumptions that you can use for planning, based on a scenario with widespread COVID-19 communal transmission: A significant percentage of your laboratory workforce may be out sick or unable to come to work. Essential research infrastructure, such as power and telecommunications, will be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) and Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) personnel will maintain their essential research support functions, although some lower-priority services may need to be curtailed (e.g., less frequent waste pick-up by EH&S, fewer DLAM-led vivarium walk-throughs and researcher training classes). Orders for critical supplies may be delayed, for example, due to departmental staff absences or supply chain interruptions. Processing of visas by the federal government may be delayed, resulting in delayed appointments. Core facilities and other fee-for-service resources may not be available. Steps you can take now to ensure continuity of critical functions: Identify procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention (e.g., cell culture maintenance, animal studies). Assess and prioritize critical laboratory activities, including care for animals housed in your laboratory. Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed or delayed. For research involving animals, consider delaying animal ordering and imports, and cease or reduce breeding activities. With classes moving to remote instruction through the next quarter, undergraduate student workers are not expected to report for laboratory duties and their tasks should be covered accordingly. Identify personnel able to safely perform essential activities and cross-train research staff to fill in for others who may be out sick or unable to come to work. Communicate any need for DLAM support or technical services promptly. Identify how the viability of laboratories, stored materials, animals, etc. will be monitored and addressed in the event regular staff cannot be there in the normal manner. Ensure that you have emergency contact information for your critical staff, including cell phone numbers; develop a communication plan. Ensure you are documenting critical step-by-step instructions in your Standard Operating Procedures. Coordinate with colleagues who have similar research activities to identify ways to ensure coverage of critical activities. Review and test contingency plans and emergency procedures with researchers and staff. Important considerations for lab work as well as human subjects research contingency plans should focus on maintaining a safe distance between people, which can be accomplished utilizing technology, such as online video/teleconferencing, as an alternative to reduce nonessential in-person interactions. Maintain a sufficient inventory of critical supplies that may be impacted by global shipping delays. Identify and consider your ability to work with limited quantities (or completely without) common perishable items, such as dry ice, liquid nitrogen and various gas cylinders. Communicate significant planned absences and/or lab closures to your EH&S Research Safety representatives, business offices, DLAM and other key administrative units. Prioritize. Depending upon the nature of your research, consider prioritizing work that can only be carried out in your research facility, and put off work amenable to remote support, such as data analysis. Stockpiling results and data now that could be analyzed remotely in the future is a potential option that might create future flexibility. Remote access: Ensure that those involved in research projects have access to information they need to carry out work remotely (e.g., access to literature, computational resources, existing datasets and research-related files, for example using Box and meeting software such as Zoom). Access to Hoffman2 computation and data storage resources, mobile web resources and statistics consultation managed through the Office of Information Technology will continue to be available. Check that any department computational and data storage resources will be available and, if so, ensure remote access. While UCLA Libraries remain open and fully operational, currently scheduled in-class training sessions and requests for new consultations and training sessions may be handled remotely. Review this handout on backing up and protecting research data (PDF). Test and update remote work technologies such as VPN, Box and Zoom conferencing. Ensure that remote access (e.g., the use of a personally owned computer) complies with security and privacy requirements for access and data to safeguard UCLA resources, most especially when data are sensitive or restricted. The UC Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes). Measures you can take to prevent the spread of illness among your group: Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Implement measures to reduce density and allow distancing of lab/research personnel. For example, increasing spacing between researchers where possible to more than 6 feet, having personnel come to the lab in shifts, allowing every other bench to be unoccupied, etc. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Self-isolate and do not travel or go to work or school when you are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze then throw the tissue in the trash. Then wash your hands with soap and water. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in your workplace. Research safety: Safety is critical, and with the potential for unexpected absences, it is important that research activities be left in a safe state daily. Experiments should be left each day in a stable mode such that they do not present any biological, chemical or physical hazards in case of a prolonged absence. Further, experiments must incorporate ""fail-safe"" measures; that is, in the event that a member of the research team is not able to return to the lab the next day, or if there is a failure of air supply, cooling, power, water supply, vacuum or other connection, the experiment should not create hazardous conditions. Outside of active experiments, biological, chemical and radiological materials and equipment must be secured in a safe manner. Physically hazardous equipment (cryogenic, heated, pressurized, under vacuum, etc.) similarly must be maintained in a safe state. Questions and requests for assistance regarding research safety can be addressed to UCLA Environment, Health & Safety: Main Phone: 310-825-5689 EH&S Hotline: 310-825-9797 Biosafety Consultations: biosafety@ehs.ucla.edu Chemical Consultations and Lab Safety: laboratorysafety@ehs.ucla.edu Radiation Safety: 310-825-5396 or radiationsafety@ehs.ucla.edu Request for an experiment safety review Hazardous Waste: 310-206-1887 or hazardousmaterials@ehs.ucla.edu Research continuity summary: Advance planning will allow everyone in your research group to focus on their own efforts and work together as a team, rather than wondering how they and their team members are to proceed. Quick Checklist: Identify critical lab operations. Identify critical lab personnel and ensure they know what to do in the event of suspended operations. Remind lab personnel of your communication plan or create one if not in place. Ensure remote access to files, data, servers, etc. Identify and follow appropriate data back-up and security protocols. Prioritize experiments. Leave experiments in a safe state at the end of each day. Cancel nonessential travel and check travel restrictions before making travel plans. Check UCLA’s updated travel guidance. COVID-19 Research on Campus Under UCLA Policy 992, any research group that plans to conduct research with SARS-CoV-2 must obtain Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval prior to beginning any such research. As part of the IBC review process, a full risk assessment would be conducted to ensure worker safety and agent containment. Travel Please know that all UCLA nonessential international and domestic travel is suspended until further notice and personal international and domestic travel is strongly discouraged. Anyone arriving from CDC Level 3 countries must self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left that country. If you decide to travel, be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. There are no current restrictions on domestic travel, but you should be aware of preventative measures as you travel domestically. UCLA Research Administration UCLA Research Administration and all of its offices are fully operational and have contingency plans in place to maintain continuity of services even if personnel are working remotely. Our Office of Research Information Services (ORIS) will continue to support our central research administration systems to ensure ongoing operations. The Office of Contract and Grant Administration (OCGA) will continue to review and submit proposals, accept awards, issue sub awards and manage communications with sponsors. Cayuse, EPASS, PI Portal, ORA Resource Center, and other systems will be available as usual. Extramural Fund Management (EFM) will continue to submit financial reports and invoices, process close-outs, manage reimbursements and provide financial management support for grant and contract funds. EFM systems will remain on line in conjunction with the financial systems. We expect federal agencies to continue to provide services, and to be flexible about deadlines as needed in emergency situations. If agencies are officially closed, we will continue to do what we can, understanding that transactions will likely remain in queue until agency operations are resumed. We will continue to work with state, county, city and nonprofit sponsors as possible. Additional information will be posted on the ORA, OCGA and EFM websites as new information is obtained. NSF has developed a new website for the research community with detailed guidance on COVID-19. This includes guidance for awardee organizations, researchers and reviewers of NSF proposals. The Office of the Human Research Protection Program (OHRPP) and the Research Safety & Animal Welfare Administration (RSAWA) will continue to operate as usual, including convening regular meetings of the Institutional Review Boards (IRB), Animal Research Committee (ARC), Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Radiation Safety Committees (RSC). Our WebIRB, RATS, and SafetyNet systems can be accessed anywhere an individual has internet access. Similarly, the OHRPP and RSAWA staff have the capability to conduct faculty committee meetings via Zoom as needed. As a reminder, all changes/modifications to research protocols still need to be reviewed and approved by the relevant oversight committee, except for incorporation of a COVID-19 screening protocol and addition of measures needed to avoid an immediate apparent hazard to a patient/participant. If a research protocol requires modification due to COVID-19 implications, contact OHRPP directly so those submissions can be triaged in an expeditious manner. For any questions or concerns related to your protocols, contact the OHRPP office or RSAWA office. Clinical Research Activities Existing studies that meet the definition of an NIH Clinical Trial (PDF) should proceed if the benefit to study participants outweighs the risks of participation. PIs can reach out to OHRPP staff if they have questions about participant risk and benefit. All research teams are urged to assess study visits with PIs, protocols and sponsors, and assess if visits can be conducted through telephonic or video-conferenced methods without increased risk or compromise of safety of research subjects; otherwise, research participants should come to UCLA for their study visits just as they would for routine clinical care. Study team-participant interaction should be restricted only to essential staff. The Office of Clinical Research is fully operational and has contingency plans in place to maintain continuity. The Oncore Clinical Research Management System can be accessed anywhere an individual has internet access. Contact our staff at ResearchGo@mednet.ucla.edu or visit the UCLA CTSI Research Go COVID-19 INFO page for more detailed information. My office stands ready to support you in planning to ensure that your research activities continue with as little impact as possible. If you have questions, or if there is additional guidance you would like to see provided, please contact C19@research.ucla.edu. Sincerely, Roger M. Wakimoto, Ph.D. Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities",2088,cal,3
Los Angeles,16-Mar-2020,"To UCLA Recreation Members In times like these we must all do our part to protect ourselves and our community. While this may necessitate that we discontinue or restrict some aspects of our daily lifestyles, we hope you are still taking care of YOU during these stressful and unprecedented times. If you haven’t already, please browse our website for our free virtual opportunities to stay active. As a reminder, your membership was automatically placed on hold on March 16th until we are able to reopen. For those of you who requested a refund, we are actively working to process refunds the week of May 4th-8th. Please be aware, refund requests submitted after April 27th will not be processed until we reopen.

Los Angeles,16-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues: We wanted to write to express our deep appreciation for the incredible efforts that you are making to support our students and maintain academic continuity under these trying circumstances. We recognize that everyone on campus  faculty, staff, and students  is navigating a public health crisis that is causing significant temporary changes in both daily life and campus practices. It is important in such circumstances that we take care of ourselves and each other as we navigate this temporary crisis. But we also wanted to reassure you of our deep and ongoing commitment to UCLA as an in-person, residential research university. Although we are moving to remote instruction to help secure the health of the university, this is a temporary response to an immediate crisis. UCLA has a long tradition of bringing faculty and students together to pursue knowledge in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and museums; to encourage the arts in performance spaces and studios; and to discover and disseminate new knowledge and techniques in clinics and hospitals. Moreover, we believe firmly that the residential setting allows for the informal creativity and sharing of ideas and arguments that help students, researchers, staff, and faculty thrive intellectually and personally. We want to make one final point. UCLA faculty and staff have, for many years, been involved in exploring the possibilities of online teaching and learning. As those who have participated know, successfully mounting online courses takes a tremendous amount of labor, thought, and time. Our current online classes also have undergone rigorous Academic Senate review. Although we do not doubt the tremendous creativity of our faculty and graduate students, we want to assure everyone that we know that the remote courses that you will be offering this spring are not truly “online courses.” No one can expect you to master all of the various technologies, suddenly transition to sophisticated document delivery, or skillfully lead 500 people in a Zoom discussion without appropriate preparation. We are asking that you do your best in thinking of ways to offer your students your course materials in alternative modes under trying circumstances for all. The campus has been working hard to provide you with support as you move your classes into remote modes. Please seek out the help you need, but please remember that this situation is uncharted territory for the staff who are trying to help you to provide the best education that you can in this moment. UCLA is a remarkable institution filled with remarkably creative and talented people. We will get through the disruption of COVID-19. When we do, we are committed to returning to the teaching and learning that has made UCLA such a distinguished educational environment. Sincerely, Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Michael Meranze Chair, UCLA Academic Senate",461,cal,3
Los Angeles,17-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: As we all work to adapt to our new environment following the president’s Friday declaration of a national emergency and recent announcements by the governor and mayor instituting state- and city-wide restrictions, we wanted to provide you with the latest information about UCLA’s continued efforts to protect our campus and the broader community from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although you can continue to visit UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website as well as Bruins Safe Online for the latest information, here are some updates intended to provide the Bruin community with helpful guidance: Meetings and events: UCLA is suspending all nonessential events of any size through the end of spring quarter. We strongly encourage every member of the campus community to carefully consider whether it is necessary to convene in person or hold group meetings or any other type of gathering. Public health officials tell us that reducing population density is the best way to limit the spread of COVID-19. Working remotely: If you are able to conduct your work remotely, we ask you to speak with your supervisor about how best to do so. Remaining six feet away from others, whenever possible, can help prevent infections transmitted by an uncovered cough or sneeze or from touching contaminated surfaces. All employees should remain home if they are sick. Campus libraries: In an effort to help reduce density, all UCLA Library locations are closed to the public until further notice, effective immediately. Only three libraries Powell, Young Research Library and the Biomedical Library will be open temporarily to UCLA students, staff and faculty with BruinCards on March 17 and 18 from 7:00 a.m. to midnight; and on March 19 from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Students will be able to check out lending laptops and tablets at these three locations through Campus Library Instructional Computing Commons. After March 19, all libraries will be closed until further notice. Materials on loan to patrons will automatically be renewed through June 30, 2020. Please visit the UCLA Library website for additional information on library hours, remote services and other resources. Campus dining and restaurants: All campus dining halls and quick-service restaurants will become “to-go” operations. Students will still enter the dining halls, but food will be served in to-go containers and items that had previously been offered at self-service stations (such as desert, pizza, soda and fruit) will instead be available in to-go containers; salad bars are being replaced by pre-mixed salads or will have an attendant taking orders. Managers and/or signs will control access and encourage students to line up at least six feet apart from each other. Some ASUCLA eateries have reduced hours, and all locations that remain open will be to-go only. Some, including Wolfgang Puck Express, are closed, but for now, most other ASUCLA eateries will continue serving to-go options. Knowing that things could change quickly, please check ASUCLA’s hours to confirm when and whether an eatery is open. In dining spaces, ASUCLA is removing large numbers of tables to increase the space between diners to at least six feet, and posting signs today to encourage guests to keep six feet or more between them while in line. Plateia at the Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center is also to-go only, and the lounge is closed. ASUCLA convenience markets remain open. Student support line: We will establish a support line for students if they need guidance on any issue related to COVID-19 or how campus operations are affected. Students can reach the support line at 310-825-3894 beginning Wednesday at 9 a.m., and it will remain in operation weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Grading and exams: Because students are taking final exams under these difficult circumstances, the UCLA Academic Senate strongly encourages all instructors to consider the current circumstances in both planning and evaluating final assessments and avail themselves of one of the options outlined in this message to faculty (PDF). We know that all of you are working to adapt to this rapidly evolving situation not just academically and professionally, but also personally. These challenges are only compounded by the personal challenges we all face, whether caring for family or finding basic household items in stores. We have been struck by the compassion and empathy we have seen Bruins exhibit for one another. Whether it is offering to check in with peers or going grocery shopping for neighbors, your actions have demonstrated that our capacity to live our True Bruin values is limitless. At some point soon, life will return to normal and we look forward to resuming activity as usual on campus. Until then, this new way of working, learning and living can protect us all, particularly those who are most vulnerable in our community. Thank you once again for your commitment to our campus and each other. Your resilience, understanding, and flexibility these past few weeks represent the very best of the Bruin spirit.

Los Angeles,17-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: We have learned that a member of our UCLA campus community has tested positive for COVID-19. The individual is a UCLA staff member who works off campus, has self-isolated at their off-campus residence and is receiving care. I have spoken to our fellow Bruin to express my hope for a quick recovery. We are determining whether there are members of the UCLA community who need to be advised about their contacts with our staff member, and if so, we will activate our notification process accordingly. Please know that if there is a need for anyone to be isolated or tested, they will be contacted. We understand this news may heighten anxiety and create concern among members of our community. Students should contact the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217, and faculty and staff should call their health care providers, if they develop flu-like symptoms. Please always call ahead before arriving. Additionally, mental health is as important as physical health. Students can always seek services at UCLA’s Counseling and Psychological Services and staff and faculty can contact the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. It bears repeating that as testing for COVID-19 becomes more broadly available, we should prepare ourselves to expect the numbers of self-quarantine cases like mine and confirmed cases like that of our staff member to increase across the country and at UCLA. We have been expecting this reality, and we have prepared and implemented safety protocols accordingly. We remain committed to transparency and open communication on this important issue. When there are future confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our campus community, we will keep you informed through UCLA’s COVID-19 website, Bruins Safe Online and UCLA’s Twitter feed. Above all, please know that every decision we make is guided by our top priority of protecting the health and safety of our Bruin and global communities, in what continues to be a rapidly evolving environment. Our decisions on matters such as remote learning are driven by what science tells us: The reduction of population density helps slow the spread of the virus. You are all part of a community that cares about you. I am grateful to each of you for supporting UCLA’s broader efforts to help the world fight the spread of COVID-19. I could not be prouder to be a Bruin. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor",393,cal,3
Los Angeles,17-Mar-2020,"Ramping Down UCLA Laboratory Research To the Campus Community: This message is sent with gratitude for your patience while we navigate the ever-changing environment of the developing COVID-19 crisis. As we continue to take measures to protect the health and well-being of everyone in our campus community, we have made the decision to ramp down nonessential campus operations, including research activities. Effective immediately, each principal investigator or group leader of a laboratory research program (experimental, computational or otherwise) must prepare and implement a strategy to ramp down campus laboratory research activities, with the expectation that suspended lab access will likely last at least six to eight weeks. PIs and laboratory leaders should also share your strategies with your department leadership. In your strategy, anticipate how the work of your group will be slowed or stopped for the coming weeks and identify essential research personnel and essential experiments. To be clear, essential research personnel are those individuals who are: Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals. This includes vivarium staff and non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care. The faculty and/or research staff who are necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research that includes not easily replaceable perishable research materials. Not easily replaceable perishable research materials could include primary cell lines or long-term experiments for which there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end. (An example would be a continual, ongoing one-month experiment that requires regular measurements or maintenance, without which all previous data would be lost.) Responsible for maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage to equipment or extraordinary cost for example, cryogen fill on NMR spectrometers. Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion for example, research that relies on the ability to make specific measurements only a few times a year. Note that students (including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel. The decision to report to campus lies with the student worker, not their research advisor. Essential experiments are those for which suspension of activities would cause irreparable harm to the research project. Any requests for continuation of such a project must be approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. You may wish to use the UCLA Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist (PDF) to plan the ramp-down process, noting that not all of the items on the list may apply to your specific lab. While this process may be disheartening, know that the steps you take now will support the long-term success of our labs and research groups. In addition, be advised that effective March 16, UCLA has issued a temporary policy related to human subjects–related research visits. Specifically, in-person research visits should not be conducted unless the specific research visit provides an immediate benefit to a participant’s health and/or well-being. Visit UCLA CTSI Research Go and the Office of the Human Research Protection Program website for detailed information about UCLA’s COVID-19 clinical research policy and human subjects research. In the meantime, I ask that you actively encourage staff, students and postdocs in your group to work from home whenever feasible. Encourage your colleagues to maintain a safe space of six feet from each other and practice good hygiene, and model these practices yourself. Absolutely require that if anyone in the group is sick, including essential personnel, they do not come to work. Establish a system by which you, and members of the lab, can check each other’s status. As a reminder, the University of California Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops and data storage devices off site, including to their homes. We are facing an unprecedented challenge with COVID-19 and must all do our part to flatten the growth curve to protect our community and lessen predictable pressures on our public health infrastructure. Visit UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online for additional information and contact C19@research.ucla.edu with your research-specific questions.

Los Angeles,17-Mar-2020,"Mental Health and Social Well-Being amid Coronavirus Spread To the Campus Community: The concerns about the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are being addressed in multiple ways here at UCLA. At the same time, information about the virus and its effects, including misleading information from outside sources, can heighten our fear and anxiety. The uncertainty surrounding this global and local event is unsettling for many of us, and there is much uncertainty about the coming weeks and months. You are receiving information from good, trusted sources here at UCLA through our dedicated COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online. We also recommend the World Health Organization (PDF) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites, resources that offer trusted information about mental health considerations. Even during these trying times, there are many aspects of daily life that remain under your control, including how you take care of your emotional, social and physical well-being, and your ability to support and help your friends, family and community. Here are a few highlights: Take care of your body. Eating healthy meals, exercising, getting at least seven hours of sleep a night, and limiting your alcohol consumption can help your immune system. Even while maintaining a safe distance from other people, you can still go outside! Regular exercise can reduce anxiety. Just be sure to protect yourself and others by following these guidelines for managing anxiety and stress. Learn and share. Learn best practices from trusted resources on how to limit your exposure to, and the spread of, COVID-19, and share that information with others. UCLA is providing information relevant to our specific roles as students, faculty and staff. The WHO website details actions for health care workers, team leaders, caretakers of children, older adults and people in isolation. The CDC website lists common warning signs of emotional stress responses (including problems with sleep and concentration, and increased drug or alcohol use) and some ideas for how to cope. Do things that give you purpose and meaning. Helping others is a gift, and it is good for your own well-being. Many in our community are more vulnerable to the impact of the novel coronavirus. You can help others by offering reassurance and emotional support, for instance. Take care of basic needs (including food security). The CPO Food Closet is open today through Thursday, March 19, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and on Friday, March 20, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The food closet will open again on Monday, March 23, and on Tuesday, March 24, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., but will close for the remainder of Spring Break. These hours are subject to change, so please check the CPO Facebook page for up-to-date hours of operation. Lastly, the Economic Crisis Response Team will have its meal voucher program distribution four times during finals week. Please see the team’s most up-to-date meal voucher distribution schedule (PDF) for times and locations. Take care of your mind. Constant searching, scrolling or consumption of coronavirus news will only make us feel more afraid and powerless. Take breaks from media coverage and use UCLA’s COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online for updates rather than checking unreliable sites. For many of us, maintaining routines will help keep us positive, balanced and mentally well. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. Reach out to others and offer support, empathy, information and, if possible, tangible help. Stay connected using technology such as video chat, Zoom group calls, and cellphone texting and conversations. Personal relationships are crucial in maintaining perspective and elevating mood. Increase your feel-good activities. Whether it’s mindfulness, talking to your friends and family members, going for walks, taking part in sports, journaling, or watching Netflix, now is the time to increase positive experiences in your daily schedule. For a quick stress reliever, UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center offers free guided meditations in English and Spanish. Treat everyone with dignity and respect. Let’s work together to address xenophobic sentiments that perpetuate stigma toward people from the countries most affected by COVID-19. Members of our community are experiencing additional fear right now because of the increased suspicion and racism from others who wrongly attach COVID-19 to an ethnicity or nationality. Language like COVID-19 “victims” or “the diseased” is stigmatizing and harmful. Instead, we can say “people who are being treated for or recovering from COVID-19.” Pay attention to how you’re feeling. Fear, worry and dread are normal reactions during this unprecedented time. People who have pre-existing mental health concerns are more vulnerable and face a higher risk of worsening mental health as the virus spreads. If you have a history of mental health concerns, form a plan such as how to access health workers, counselors and prescriptions. Resources for students are available at Counseling & Psychological Services and for staff at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. This message reflects the expertise of the leaders of the Semel Healthy Campus Initiative MindWell and EngageWell pods. The Semel Healthy Campus Initiative website provides a wealth of additional information on health and well-being. You are part of a UCLA community that is home to health experts who are committed to containing, delaying and reducing the impact of this virus in our community. We encourage you to stay abreast of all new information from trusted sources and share accurate information with others. Each of us can play a very important role by caring for ourselves and caring for others in our community.

Los Angeles,18-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: Being a Bruin means more than just being on UCLA’s campus; it also encompasses the emotional and social ties we share with one another. For many UCLA students, no experience is more valued than celebrating the culmination of their hard work and dedication along with their families and friends during graduation ceremonies. As we all work to limit the spread of COVID-19, it has become increasingly clear that we will not be able to gather in person for spring 2020 commencement ceremonies, so the College commencement, doctoral hooding ceremony and all campus graduation ceremonies will be adapted to be virtual events. Our decisions to transition to remote learning and suspend all nonessential events of any size through the end of the spring quarter have been driven entirely by our desire to protect the health and safety of our community, which includes all of the family and friends who would have joined us at our commencement ceremonies. For the UCLA College, whose commencement is UCLA’s largest, we will hold an engaging virtual ceremony on June 12, 2020. Consistent with our tradition, the ceremony will feature an inspiring keynote speaker, whose name will be announced soon. The College will offer new opportunities to connect our graduates in a variety of ways that further enhance the virtual event. As we move into a spring quarter of remote learning, please know that we are actively exploring how we might enhance the student experience while everyone is away from campus, particularly for our seniors. For the soon-to-be graduates of UCLA, in the weeks ahead, we will provide additional information about how we will mark their important accomplishments. Campus leadership will be in touch with the schools and departments that hold individual commencements to provide support where possible. We will share more details about those efforts as soon as we are able. Please remember that, even for an event as momentous as commencement, the day does not define the journey. We will work diligently to make graduation as special as possible for all of our students and all of your loved ones. Even when we are apart, we remain deeply connected as Bruins, and I look forward to celebrating your accomplishments this spring. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor",376,cal,3
Los Angeles,19-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: Yesterday, we made a decision about this year’s commencement ceremonies without first consulting our students and fully understanding their preferences for this important rite of passage. In these unprecedented times, we are guided by our goal of protecting the safety of our Bruin community. But we should have known the impact this decision would make, especially during this tense time, and we should have listened first. For this, I apologize. We have heard the important voices of our students and their families, and based on those, we will step back and make a decision on commencement in consultation with students and student leaders. I understand that for so many of our students and their families and friends, our commencement ceremonies celebrate not only past achievements, but also the promise of what is to come. I deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication that goes into earning a UCLA degree. It is a great accomplishment fully deserving of a ceremony that acknowledges students’ years of commitment to reaching that milestone. Our ceremonies are as diverse as our student body. Whether it is our campus, departmental or student-initiated commencement, our ceremonies are without question the most wonderful and moving events that we have on our campus, not only because they honor our students, but also because they give family and friends who supported them a proud moment they, too, will carry for the rest of their lives. The decisions we have had to make in the past few weeks, all designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our community, are ones that few of us ever anticipated in our lifetimes. We are all working hard to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances and find ways to prioritize the health of our community. In this environment, despite our best efforts, sometimes we move too quickly. I regret that we did that here and did not properly include students in the decision-making process. We will be connecting with our student leadership, including the Undergraduate Students Association Council and Graduate Students Association, so that we can make these decisions together. We are committed to giving all of our students the commencement they deserve. We should have known the tremendous impact that this decision would have on our students and their loved ones and friends. We will do better to include these important voices going forward. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor",400,cal,3
Los Angeles,20-Mar-2020,"Today, Los Angeles County (PDF) and the City of Los Angeles (PDF), among other nearby jurisdictions, ordered all residents to stay home starting 11:59 p.m. tonight, March 19, through April 19, 2020, which are actions similar to those of other large metropolitan areas attempting to limit the spread of COVID-19. Educational institutions, like UCLA, are subject to these orders but are considered essential businesses. This means we will suspend all on-campus operations with the exception of those that are essential and cannot be conducted remotely, effective 11:59 p.m. on March 20, 2020. We understand that each new announcement from campus leadership about the coronavirus creates new challenges for all of us. Your flexibility and commitment the past few weeks have been inspiring and our community is now called upon to comply with these orders. During this time, campus will operate similar to winter closure, meaning that only a few core services will be operating. Here is a summary of those operations we have determined to be essential for purposes of complying, including those that will continue on campus at this time: Health care services and corresponding support. UCLA hospitals and clinics will remain open and fully operational; more information is available on UCLA Health’s website Classroom and laboratory instruction for remote learning will continue through the end of spring quarter. Deans and chairs will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed Student housing and dining services Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels Animal care or animal research Research laboratory safety Research approved by the vice chancellor for research Emergency response, such as police, fire, emergency medical services, and environment health and safety Emergency management Custodial services will continue to operate at reduced levels, but surfaces in common areas continue to be sanitized regularly Building systems IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning Human resources, finance and counseling services will continue, but primarily remotely The Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center will remain open for in-person services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), although all services will be offered via telehealth. Students should call CAPS at 310-825-0768, 24/7, for assistance. No onsite services will be available at this time This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential administrative services will be distributed separately. In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, below is a summary of decisions from our administration. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. Employees in the Health System are generally exempt from the restrictions below when providing health care services. The current UCLA directives instruct that you should: Cease all in-person instruction. Remote teaching and learning will continue through the end of spring quarter without exceptions. Instructors and students should become familiar with academic continuity tools and faculty may join UCLA’s workshops for remote teaching and learning. Only stay in student housing if you need it. The county and city orders do not prevent students from moving out of campus housing to return to their permanent residence. However, students who need to stay in housing may be moved to a different building to support the needs of the community. As shared earlier, students who choose to move out of UCLA housing can obtain prorated relief from their housing contracts. Students should emailUCLAhousing@housing.ucla.edu with any questions. Essential activities including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence is permitted. Only come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so to fulfill an essential function. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation on campus. If you do not think that you are supporting an essential operation, but are expected to report to work anyway, you can contact your department’s human resources representative to confirm whether your work is essential. Courtesy parking is available for employees and students who must come to campus during this period in order to reduce reliance on public transportation and avoid crowds. Log in to the Bruin ePermit portal to register your vehicle to park in select parking structures at no additional cost. Employees and students with parking permits will not be charged for parking during this period, even those using payroll deduction. Regularly visit UCLA’s COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address mental and social wellbeing during this time. Students may also call or contact CAPS at 310-825-0768 24/7 for assistance. Staff and faculty may contact the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. Contact UCLA’s student support line for general student support at 310-825-3894 from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays. Send email to covid19@ucla.edu with any questions regarding UCLA’s response to COVID-19. You should not do the following: Do not host any in-person UCLA events or gatherings of any size through the end of spring quarter. Do not come to work if you are sick. Students living on or off campus may contact the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 with questions about how to self-quarantine, for health monitoring or if they need other support. Faculty and staff who are sick should contact their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. If you are ordered to self-isolate or to self-quarantine related to a COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis, notify UCLA Occupational Health Services at 310-267-3300. Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave. Do not come to work if you have been asked to work remotely. Some personnel assigned to essential roles that need to be conducted on campus will need to continue to work on campus, and leadership is working with supervisors to define and identify these roles and personnel. Note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel. We expect that supervisors will work with their staff to update business continuity plans. If employees, including student employees, are not required to work on campus, but cannot work from home due to the nature of their jobs, the UC Office of the President has developed expanded leave policies and employees should consult with their supervisors about use of these policies. IT support services will be fully operational and faculty and staff who need assistance while working remotely should contact their local help desk per standard procedure. If you are not able to reach your departmental help desk, you may call the IT Services Support Center at (310) 267-HELP (4357). Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down, continuity or laboratory safety work. Essential experiments and essential research personnel may continue, but only with the approval of designated leadership within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR), the David Geffen School of Medicine, the Samueli School of Engineering and the UCLA College. The OVCR is issuing more specific guidelines for on-campus research, off-campus research and clinical research activities, which will be distributed separately. Do not come to work to take advantage of better internet connections or fewer distractions, except for classroom or laboratory instruction for remote teaching. We understand that it may be harder for some employees to conduct work from home. UCLA has procured IT equipment and portable internet hotspots to help faculty and staff work from home. Faculty and staff can address their needs with supervisors or department chairs. Do not come to work to retrieve items from your office or visit colleagues required to be on campus after Friday, March 20 at 11:59 p.m. Only come to campus if you have permission from your supervisor. We want to assure each member of our Bruin community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on UCLA’s COVID-19 information page, Bruins Safe Online and UCLA’s Twitter feed. Most importantly, please continue to be good to each other and yourselves. We will get through this together. We are all Bruins, now and always. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost",1350,cal,3
Los Angeles,20-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: We are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic may be creating unforeseen financial challenges for our students and their families, and we are working diligently with our campus partners to address its effects on the Bruin community. In an effort to help members of our community manage their finances during this turbulent time, UCLA has decided to make the following changes for spring quarter 2020: BruinPay Plan enrollment. Students can continue to enroll in BruinPay Plan through Friday, April 10 at 5 p.m. PDT. Eligible students can enroll in BruinPay Plan to pay their term tuition and registration fees in monthly installments (three installments for quarter students). If you are eligible to enroll, you will see an active enrollment link on the BruinBill homepage under the My BruinPay Plan section. You will need a U.S. checking or savings account or a credit card to complete enrollment. Spring term tuition. The deadline for online payment through BruinBill for spring quarter 2020 has been extended to April 10 at 5 p.m. PDT. Please note that no changes have been announced for the spring quarter 2020 UC systemwide and campus-based fee. If changes occur, they will be reflected on your BruinBill. More information can be found on the Registrar’s Office COVID-19 FAQ. Spring quarter 2020 Course Materials Fees. In light of the campus’s plans to offer remote instruction for spring 2020, UCLA is suspending all undergraduate and graduate Course Materials Fees that are tied to specific courses. The list of courses that will not be charged Course Materials Fees for spring 2020 can be found on the Registrar’s Office website. More information on available payment options will follow in the coming days. In the meantime, for questions related to the tuition or BruinPay Plan deadline extensions, please contact the Student Accounts Office via the MyUCLA Message Center or by calling (310) 825-9194 (dial option 7).

Los Angeles,20-Mar-2020,"Most Campus Laboratory Research to Shut Down To the Campus Community: I appreciate your efforts to develop strategies for ramping down on-campus research activities following my March 17 communication. In light of Los Angeles County’s safer at home order, UCLA has determined that these ramp-down strategies must be fully deployed by Monday. Please know that buildings will be locked at 10 p.m. tonight and remain locked on Monday, so please check with your department if you require special arrangements to enter your building. Effective at 11:59 p.m. tonight, all on-campus operations will be suspended, with the exception of those that are essential and cannot be conducted remotely. Effective immediately, all group meetings, courses and scientific convocations are to transition to virtual environments for example, Zoom, Slack or another approved, secure platform. Research performed on campus If you have not already done so, please obtain approval for any essential experiments and essential research personnel you believe must remain active on campus during this time. To minimize community interactions, each lab is to activate no more than one or two essential research personnel to manage animal husbandry, equipment or essential experiments. To ensure the safety of essential research personnel, labs should establish a communication protocol and use it while personnel are working on campus. Some units, including the David Geffen School of Medicine, Samueli School of Engineering and the UCLA College Divisions of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences, have developed internal processes and deadlines for researchers to obtain approval for personnel and experiments. Those units will communicate directly with researchers under their purview. All other requests are to be submitted to me via C19@research.ucla.edu. Requests to continue research activities must include a full description of why the on-campus research is essential, a timeline for completion and documented support of the department chair or dean; essential personnel should also be identified in each request. All on-campus projects and personnel not approved to continue research activities or that do not have a pending request to their unit filed are required to cease operations. As previously communicated, essential research personnel are those individuals who are: Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals. This includes vivarium lab staff and non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care, although staffing should be minimized to the extent feasible to maintain the health and safety of the animals. Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research that includes not easily replaceable, perishable research materials. Responsible for the maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage to equipment or extraordinary cost for example, cryogen fill on NMR spectrometers. Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion for example, research that relies on the ability to make specific measurements only a few times a year. As a reminder, note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel. Essential experiments are those for which suspension of on-campus activities would cause irreparable harm to the research project. This will usually involve ongoing animal experiments that required enormous time and cost to get to their current state, and that will be completed in the near future. UCLA has also made a commitment to prioritizing COVID-19 research. Requests for continuation of such projects must be described in writing as indicated above. In animal facilities, all animal orders, imports/exports and internal transfers will be put on hold and rodent breeding reduced to the minimum possible. Please contact UCLA’s Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine for guidance on identifying unique and irreplaceable animals. Study areas maintaining aquatic, avian or other species are expected to maintain basic animal care and husbandry operations, and labs with USDA-covered animals that require specialized lab care or intensive husbandry operations are expected to continue providing this care as well. Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) staff are available for safety consultations related to ramping down your on-campus research activities. Contact C19Support@ehs.ucla.edu for support. In the event of a lab emergency, researchers should immediately call 911 rather than the EH&S hotline or email contacts. Clinical research activities With respect to clinical research, in-person research visits should not be conducted unless the specific research visit provides an immediate benefit to a participant’s health and/or well-being, or the visit is part of the course of ongoing clinical care. (Note: Policies for routine and elective visits are also undergoing review by UCLA Health.) Please consider suspending recruitment or conducting follow-up visits remotely, if this presents no harm to your participants. Please also be certain to personally inform participants of the risks of COVID-19. Visit UCLA CTSI Research Go and the Office of the Human Research Protection Program website for detailed information about UCLA’s COVID-19 clinical research policy and human subjects research. Off-campus research activities Research activities that can be performed remotely and do not require physical interaction with human subjects (for example, field studies, surveys, record reviews and data analysis) can and should continue. As a reminder, the University of California Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than lab notebooks, laptops and data storage devices off-site, including to their homes. Notebooks taken off campus must be inventoried and tracked to protect university property while off-site. While it is not possible to predict how long we will remain in this new state of ramped-down activities, you should plan for the possibility that this could continue through the end of the quarter or longer. I will continue to communicate with you regularly as I receive new information. Thank you for being True Bruins and exemplary members of our community. Please direct questions to C19@research.ucla.edu. Sincerely, Roger Wakimoto Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities",951,cal,3
Los Angeles,25-Mar-2020,"Availability of Campus Services During Safer at Home Orders To the Campus Community: In response to safer at home orders from the State of California (PDF), County of Los Angeles (PDF) and City of Los Angeles (PDF), UCLA has suspended all on-campus operations with the exception of those that are essential and cannot be conducted remotely. As previously announced, spring quarter instruction will continue via remote learning. For a listing of which campus services and departments are open and/or available at this time, please visit the Services Available During the Safer at Home Orders webpage. Sincerely, Michael J.

Los Angeles,26-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: The Academic Senate wishes to express its appreciation to all the faculty, staff, and students who have put in such extraordinary efforts to complete the winter quarter under the stress of moving final assessments to alternative modes in response to COVID-19. We also recognize that the necessity to move to remote instruction for spring quarter will continue to pose new challenges and stresses for the campus community. We wish to acknowledge that our current situation presents considerable hardships for our students and that those hardships may fall unequally on different students. Under the university’s system of shared governance, the UCLA Academic Senate has purview over certain aspects of UCLA, distinct from the administration overseen by the chancellor. In particular, the Senate makes decisions on such matters as degree and enrollment requirements, grading policy and program establishment, disestablishment, and review. In order to support faculty, staff, and students in their efforts to sustain instructional continuity and do their best work productively under these circumstances, the Undergraduate and Graduate Councils of the Senate have exercised their purview and taken steps to increase flexibility and reduce stress for all those involved with the instructional effort. These steps are listed below. The Undergraduate Council has voted: To suspend UCLA Senate Regulation A-310 (A) and (E) for spring quarter 2020, and to empower undergraduate students in good standing to take more than one course in a term on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. To extend the deadline for changing the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction for spring quarter 2020. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020. The Graduate Council has voted: To temporarily delegate authority to departments, Interdepartmental Degree Programs (IDPs), or schools to allow graduate students in good academic standing to enroll in more than one course graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis for spring quarter 2020, including courses within the degree program, with the stipulation that departments, IDPs, or schools must accept these courses towards fulfilling degree requirements if taken for an S/U grade. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020. It is also worth noting that graduate students are already permitted to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction. These suspensions and delegations should provide both graduate and undergraduate students with the capacity to choose a course of study that will enable them to continue their progress to degree and also to adjust their academic burdens in accord with their own personal needs at this time. We recognize that these actions will not solve all of the challenges associated with remote education. But after careful consideration and review of all options, we are confident that they will best support the efforts of faculty, staff, and students as we work together to address the challenges of spring quarter. Reminder for Instructors The Academic Senate would also like to remind all instructors that the partial suspensions of Senate Regulations 332 and 505 (PDF) continue in force. These suspensions empower you to have greater flexibility both in the forms of assessment you plan to use and also in the distribution of points among different assessments. As with this past quarter, we urge instructors to use this flexibility to take into account the special challenges that will accompany remote instruction. Given the uncertainties surrounding technical issues and the possibilities of disrupted connections, as well as the closure of libraries and study spaces, we urge everyone to approach spring quarter with mutual compassion and openness to the challenges faced by all. Reminders for Undergraduate and Graduate Students We also want to point out several issues that students should consider as they chart their course for spring quarter: The capacity to declare P/NP or S/U in multiple courses is not presently available through MyUCLA. The Registrar is working diligently on this issue and expects it to be available by mid-quarter. As a result, you do not have to make any changes in your grading choices at this time. You will be able to do that later in the quarter. We do recommend, however, that you check to make certain that any courses you might wish to take P/NP or S/U offer that option to students. Please be aware that this change in grading policy does not override any requirements that colleges, departments, or programs may have that courses be taken for a letter grade in order to receive major or program credit. Please check with your advisers and counselors before you consider courses in your home program or major. Certain forms of financial aid require that you enroll for a minimum number of credits with letter grades. Please consult with Financial Aid about your particular situation. We have moved the deadline for changing your grade option in undergraduate courses from letter to P/NP until Friday of the 10th week of classes. This will allow you to evaluate your standing in a class before making a final grade option selection. Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that undergraduate students receive a C or better in order to earn a Pass in a P/NP. Similarly at UCLA, undergraduate students who take a course P/NP must achieve a C in order to receive a Pass. Undergraduate students who take a course for a letter grade will receive credit if they receive a C- or a D. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for an undergraduate student taking a course P/NP. Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that graduate students receive a B or better in order to earn a Satisfactory in a S/U. At UCLA, graduate students may receive course credit for C- and above grades unless otherwise prohibited by program requirements. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for a graduate student taking a course S/U than is required to receive credit when taking under a letter grade. The minimum GPA for a graduate degree is 3.0, so graduate students should carefully consider whether to use the S/U option depending on their individual situation, as S/U courses are not used in GPA calculations. We recognize the large challenges facing the campus and its faculty, students, and staff during spring quarter. We remain confident in the resilience of the UCLA community to work together in a spirit of patience and empathy as we pursue our educational goals during an uncertain time. Sincerely, Michael Meranze Professor of History Chair, UCLA Academic Senate",1139,cal,3
Los Angeles,27-Mar-2020,"Our Gratitude to UCLA Staff o Our Staff: As we all work to adapt to the new realities of these trying times, we want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for the deep and abiding commitment of UCLA’s staff. We know that the outsized impact of UCLA is only possible because of your dedication, hard work, and partnership. Particularly during these times of great stress and uncertainty, we want to thank you for your exceptional efforts to support our Bruin community. We have asked leadership all across UCLA to be flexible and considerate of our staff as you work to adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We know that many staff members will need flexibility, particularly those caring for dependents at home or facing other significant challenges related to the current crisis. We understand that we must be flexible and alter our expectations of what can be accomplished in this uncertain era. We recognize the enormous challenges being asked of all staff to ensure the continuity of campus operations and the more complicated support of our faculty and students in the weeks and months ahead.

Los Angeles,2-Apr-2020,"To the UC community We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time. The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together. Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time. To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus. To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time. To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID- 19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible. While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary. Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together. Fiat lux, Janet Napolitano                   Gene D.

Los Angeles,8-Apr-2020,"UCLA Guidance on Face Coverings to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 To the Campus Community: On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of cloth face coverings in public settings (especially in areas of significant community-based transmission) to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The California Department of Public Health, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (PDF) and the Office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti have also issued guidance acknowledging that wearing cloth face covers can reduce the likelihood of transmission from asymptomatic individuals who are unaware that they are infected. It is important to note that these nonmedical-grade face coverings are intended to protect others from the wearer’s respiratory droplets, and are to supplement but not substitute for measures such as physical distancing and frequent hand-washing, which continue to be the most effective methods for reducing the spread of COVID-19. While there are ongoing discussions among public health officials and other experts regarding which materials are most effective, current data suggests that acceptable options including bandanas, neck gaiters, homemade face coverings, scarves, and tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton T-shirts and towels. (See this briefing from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (PDF) for more information.) Although face coverings are not a requirement for universities under the worker protection order (PDF) issued by Mayor Garcetti on April 7, they will be important in helping us protect each other from transmitting the virus. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the Bruin community use face coverings when in public settings, conducting essential work on campus, or entering campus dining facilities or other environments in which it may be difficult to maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people. Helpful instructions for making your own face covering can be found on this CDC fact sheet (PDF) as well as in this instructional video from the U.S. Surgeon General. Detailed instructions on how to make a face mask - click for high resolution image. Click image for higher resolution. UCLA is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note these will be nonmedical-grade face coverings and will not be appropriate for health care workers, first responders or others working directly with people who have COVID-19. Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including vanpools, hospitality, dining services and laboratories. Masks will be distributed to campus departments when production is complete, which could take a week or more because of the heightened worldwide demand for them. Campus officials will coordinate with departments to disseminate the masks when we receive them. Face coverings will be required for employees working at the Luskin Conference Center, the Tiverton House, the Lake Arrowhead Conference Center, and UCLA housing and dining facilities as of this Friday, April 10.

Los Angeles,13-Apr-2020,"Mental Health and Social Well-being during the Pandemic To the Campus Community: Each of you is a valued member of the Bruin family, and we want to ensure you have information to help you maintain your health and well-being during this difficult time. We also want to acknowledge the challenges you face while continuing your work and studies virtually, often in situations and locations that are not as conducive to the level of excellence to which you are accustomed. We hope the following guidance and tips will help you adjust to the new environments in which you are working and studying. Where to get trusted information regarding COVID-19 Browse smartly. Manage your information channels. Try to avoid news and information overload and fatigue by balancing news sources. If you find yourself checking the news multiple times a day, take a break and do something else. Get credible information from trusted websites. Information from good, trusted sources here at UCLA and the University of California is available through our dedicated COVID-19 website, Bruins Safe Online, UCLA Health, the University of California and the Semel Healthy Campus Initiative (HCI) Center. We also recommend the World Health Organization (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites for further information. Tips for transitioning to online teaching, learning and working Establish a routine. Try to establish some normalcy and a regular sleep-wake cycle while working from home. Eat, sleep, work and exercise at regular times each day if possible. Get outside every day and catch some fresh air and sunshine, while maintaining a safe distance from others. Create a routine that works for you doing so can boost spirits and create a sense of normalcy. Check in with each other. Faculty can designate class time to check in with students and have students check in with each other. Please review these tips from UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for other ways faculty can support students. Keep physical distance, reduce “social distance.” Ask someone you work with, teach or learn from at UCLA how they are coping with the safer at home orders. Share how you are coping and listen to their experiences with empathy put yourself in their shoes. Monitor screen time. Balance your time online with other activities such as cooking, art, craft projects, making or playing music, reading books, calling friends or family, writing poetry, cleaning and organizing, and getting outside to walk, run or bike. If you feel overwhelmed with online meetings, it is OK to turn off the screen and do something else. Broaden your view by looking at the horizon at sunset, or gaze at stars. Check out tips for keeping busy and connected and ideas for at-home activities. Reach out on your own behalf. You are your own best advocate. Make sure your basic needs are met. If you are experiencing any disruption in basic needs for food, housing, phone service, or physical or mental health service, find the resources on campus to help. This is a time of enormous and sudden change, so feelings of anxiety, sadness, disappointment, lack of concentration or motivation are normal and expected. Here are some campus resources that you can access any time: For students: CAPS: CAPS crisis line: (310) 825-0768 Economic Crisis Response Team STAND Program (part of UCLA Depression Grand Challenge): Remote screening, tracking and treatment for anxiety and depression, suitable for students both within and outside of California. For staff and faculty: Staff and Faculty Counseling Center Resources for emotional, social and physical health Mindfulness practices. Relieve stress with meditation. UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Center offers free guided meditations in English and Spanish. 6 Feet Apart podcast. UCLA’s LiveWell podcast launched a new special series in which the team from the Semel HCI Center interviews experts about how we can maintain all dimensions of our health during the pandemic. Episode topics include maintaining your social well-being and supporting your emotional well-being. Virtual fitness classes. Check out the UCLA Recreation website for virtual classes and ways to stay fit. Cooking and meal planning. Minimize trips to the grocery store by cooking from your pantry and freezer. Pasta, rice and beans are great staples. Also, frozen vegetables are quick and easy ways to get your veggies. Frozen greens are also great in smoothies or blended soups use nuts to make them creamy. And you can add frozen fruit to smoothies, or heat it to make a fruit compote topping for yogurt. Tips for working at home Minimize distractions to improve focus. Set and respect boundaries with others in your home. Designate a dedicated work area, use headphones, take calls in another room, where possible, and devote time each day to tasks requiring focused concentration. Take frequent, regular breaks. Breaks allow your body and mind to rejuvenate. Set a reminder every hour for a two- to three-minute micro-break: Stand up, stretch and walk around. Movement is important for relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow to reduce fatigue and stress. Give your eyes a break, too, with the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Apply healthy ergonomic principles. A comfortable workstation improves efficiency and reduces physical and mental stress. UCLA telecommute tips are available to guide you through the setup process. UCLA is holding ergonomics Q&A sessions (PDF) (UCLA login required) via Zoom each Monday through Thursday from 10 to 11 a.m. for students, staff and faculty. Finally, we would like to recognize the Semel HCI pod leaders for their dedicated leadership and for sharing their expertise and insights to help the campus community maintain our social, emotional and physical well-being and build resilience for the weeks and months to come. Let’s all support each other during these challenging times. We are very proud to be Bruins, now more than ever, as we continue to observe the caring, commitment and resilience we are demonstrating by pulling together during this unprecedented time.

Los Angeles,14-Apr-2020,"To the Campus Community: On April 10, Los Angeles County extended its ""safer at home"" order (PDF) to May 15 to continue our region’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, reduced campus operations will continue through that date, pending possible future extensions. Additionally, as previously announced, remote instruction will continue through at least the end of Summer Session A. As shared in a campuswide message on March 19, the campus is operating much like it does during annual winter closure, with only essential services in effect. Please visit the UCLA Administration website for the latest information about the availability of campus services during the safer at home orders. In addition to the extension, the county’s updated order requires that all essential businesses, including universities, develop protocols for maintaining physical distance (PDF) in facilities that are frequented by the public and employees. The order also requires that everyone wear cloth face coverings when visiting essential businesses, and it requires employees to wear cloth face coverings if they work in areas where they will be in contact with others for 10 minutes or more in areas where a distance of 6 feet or more cannot be maintained. Exceptions include individuals performing roles that require more prescriptive personal protective equipment, such as first responders and those in health care and research labs. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. UCLA is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff who are working on campus in close quarters (at a distance of 6 feet or less for 10 minutes or more) and for students living in on-campus housing. Employees who need cloth facing coverings should speak with their department managers; managers are asked to please fill out this Cloth Face Covering Request Form for their teams. For students living on the Hill, a communication will be sent from Housing on when and where these masks will be available, once they have been received. This UCLA COVID-19 Response flier (PDF) provides additional helpful information for staff and students on campus. We know that adapting to this new way of life over the past few weeks has been challenging, as so many of us are still adjusting to remote teaching, learning and working. Our nurses and doctors, residents and fellows, maintenance workers and support staff on campus are also facing daunting challenges. Please know that your resilience and commitment to UCLA’s mission is a source of motivation for your fellow Bruins. As always, UCLA is fully committed to the health and well-being of every member of the campus community. We will be in touch with additional updates, and we are posting new information regularly on UCLA’s COVID-19 information page and Bruins Safe Online. Please continue to take good care of yourselves and each other. Sincerely, Michael J. Beck Administrative Vice Chancellor",477,cal,4
Los Angeles,28-Apr-2020,"To the Campus Community: As we navigate these unprecedented times, our decisions will continue to be guided by the safety and welfare of our Bruin community. UCLA remains committed to providing the best possible experience to our students. We know there are many important questions about the coming academic year and we are dedicated to proactively sharing the latest information about our plans as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Like universities across the nation and the world, UCLA is working to develop plans despite rapidly evolving data and shifting circumstances. We understand these plans will impact all of you and we are committed to a thoughtful approach that is inclusive of the broader campus community. To that end, we have established a Future Planning Task Force that will explore and submit recommendations to us regarding academic planning, student experience, how we continue research and work, our approach to on-campus housing, our policies for events and gatherings and how physical distancing, as one key consideration, will impact these plans. The task force, chaired by UCLA Fielding School of Public Health Dean Ron Brookmeyer, includes representation from our community of students, faculty and staff, and will take numerous internal and external factors into account. We will share information about key decisions based on those recommendations as soon as we are able. As the work of this task force progresses, we wanted to share the latest information available in some key areas. Decisions on remote versus in-person instruction While we are all eager to see UCLA return to normal operations, the health and safety of our entire campus community must continue to guide our decisions. We are weighing various factors and scenarios for the 2020–21 academic year, gathering data and working closely with public health officials before making any decisions. At a minimum, since we know it might not be possible for some students to safely travel to campus, we plan to offer the option of remote learning at least for fall quarter, even if some classes are held in person. As previously announced, remote instruction will continue through the end of this year’s Summer Session A, and we will announce plans for Summer Session C soon. Tuition and mandatory fees The UC Office of the President has previously announced that “tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction, and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the academic year.” Recognizing that we need to maintain campus operations, full tuition and mandatory fees will be necessary to cover many ongoing operations related to COVID-19 such as remote instruction and services such as registration, financial aid and remote academic advising. Housing In normal times, UCLA is able to offer housing to a majority of incoming and returning students. At this point, it is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations in student housing and residential life during the 2020–21 academic year and therefore we are unfortunately unable to provide a housing guarantee. We remain absolutely committed to offering housing to as many students as possible, while adhering to the latest recommendations from public health officials and our commitment to the safety of our students. Because circumstances around the pandemic are rapidly changing, it is not yet possible to know how many students we will be able to accommodate in residential halls and apartments. Please be assured that if we are unable to fulfill housing requests, we plan to offer remote learning as an alternative. We will continue to share information as soon as we are able. In closing, we thank you all once again for your continued resilience and consideration as we navigate these challenging and unprecedented times. As a world-class public institution, we remain dedicated to sustaining UCLA’s missions of teaching, research and service. All of you and our broader communities locally and globally deserve nothing less. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost",660,cal,4
Los Angeles,7-May-2020,"Financial Support for UCLA Students Dear Students: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the financial hardships and mental health toll that it has wrought on many of our students and their families have mounted, as has the urgent need to provide relief and support during these trying times. To that end, on behalf of the chancellor and executive vice chancellor and provost, I am pleased to share that UCLA will use a portion of the funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, to provide a $200 universal impact award to all eligible students. In addition to the universal impact award, some of the CARES Act funding will go toward supporting thousands of undergraduate and graduate students who are eligible for need-based federal financial aid. These students will receive increased grant support ranging from $200 to $1,850, depending on their financial need. In accordance with our firm commitment to the principles of inclusion and equity, and our commitment to all students during these unprecedented times, UCLA will use campus resources to provide some level of support to students who have been impacted by COVID-19, but who are not eligible for CARES funding, such as our undocumented and international students. All impacted students who are not eligible for CARES funding will receive a $200 universal impact award from the university’s private and institutional grants. These students also have the opportunity to apply for need-based financial support from appropriate university resources. The universal impact award came at the recommendation of a task force, which was inclusive of undergraduate and graduate student leader representatives, who reviewed a number of options in making their recommendations on the criteria for fund distribution. Additionally, at the suggestion of student leaders on the CARES task force, we have incorporated an opt-out option that allows students to donate their share of the universal impact award to their peers who may be in greater need. Funds from the opt-out option would be used to provide grant aid to the most impacted students. We want to thank the student leaders who were on the task force for their thoughtful contributions to the decision-making process and for ensuring that student voices were heard. We are also grateful to the federal government for providing UCLA $18 million in CARES funding to specifically support student needs, and an additional $18 million for more general institutional support, which UCLA plans on using to help preserve jobs to maintain our teaching mission. Please visit MyUCLA to initiate the process to receive a universal impact award and apply for need-based financial aid. We are all one UCLA family, and we will continue to rely on each other to get through these trying times. In true Bruin spirit, we will do it together.

Merced,28-Feb-2020,"UPDATE: What You Need to Know About COVID-19
February 28, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. While we are all aware of growing concerns about COVID-19 (also called the coronavirus), as of today, no one in Merced County or on the UC Merced campus has tested positive for COVID-19.
Campus administrators are discussing this issue every day, gathering information from a variety of sources and considering new measures we might take to keep this campus safe and healthy.  
All students seeking care at the Student Health Center are being asked about recent travel and contact with people with known COVID-19, and we have recently broadened our screening practices in line with updated guidance from medical authorities. Additionally, we continue to work closely with and follow the guidance of the Merced County and California public health departments. Staff and faculty seeking care should consult their primary care provider.
You may have heard there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a Solano County resident who is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. This case is being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as possibly the first with no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual. Because of the precautions in place since this patient’s arrival, UC Davis believes there has been minimal potential for exposure at the medical center.
We would encourage you to keep yourself informed with credible information. Here are some resources you may find helpful:
UC Merced COVID-19 Information
UC Merced Student Health Center
Merced County Department of Public Health
CDC Information 
Practice daily preventative care:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Stay home if you are sick.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work and school.
Practice healthy habits: Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.
If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu.
While the progression of COVID-19 is still emerging, the CDC is reporting that for the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is low.
Again, we are taking all necessary precautions and are working with public health officials. We ask you to be kind and respectful to one another, as our Principles of Community guide our behaviors and interactions. We will continue to provide you with updates as more information becomes available.

March 6, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The health and safety of everyone at UC Merced is always our foremost concern, and we continue to monitor information about COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus.
As of today, no one in Merced County nor at the UC Merced campus has tested positive for COVID-19. To date, there has been no need to adjust operations at UC Merced, but we will continue to reassess as news develops both here and across the globe.
Our campus Emergency Management workgroup has been meeting and working with Merced County health authorities and colleagues within the University of California system to ensure we are taking all appropriate steps to protect our community.
As we continue to monitor the situation, we are also working on plans related to the continuity of research, academics and operations. Our colleagues across campus will be communicating important information about those plans to faculty, staff and students over the coming days and weeks. Please take the time to read all these communications, and ask questions if you have them.
If you are experiencing fever, cough, and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, please stay home, and call your healthcare provider to make an appointment. Students can call the Student Health Center at 209-228-2273. It is important to always call before arriving for your appointment.
If you plan to travel, please stay up to date on the university’s latest travel advisories, which currently recommend avoiding nonessential travel to China, Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea. Please be sure to provide family and friends with your itinerary and contact information, as travel restrictions and flight schedules can change rapidly.

Merced,8-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: University Travel Guidance
March 8, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Due to increasing concern regarding COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) and arising from our responsibility to keep our community healthy and safe, UC Merced is issuing this guidance for all international and domestic travel as well as a reminder of current University of California travel directives.
• All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmission), must be submitted in writing to Risk Manager Cindi Zimmerman for approval by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Gregg Camfield, prior to scheduling travel. 
This is consistent with UC President Napolitano’s directive to avoid all non-essential travel to CDC Level 3 and 2 countries.
• All university-related international travel must be registered with UC Away (also called the UC International Travel Registry). UC Away is the University of California’s portal to register university-related and personal travel.
Registration enables the university to leverage benefits and protections in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential services.
• The university strongly discourages all non-essential domestic or international travel until further notice; this includes both university-related and personal travel.
• If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.
• If you decide to travel outside the United States, please be aware that the CDC may issue new international travel warnings without notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry.
• The university strongly recommends that all domestic travel be registered with UC Away; this includes both university-related and personal travel. 
For university-related, domestic travel booked through UC Connexxus, trips are automatically registered with UC Away. However, travel booked through other means will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
• For personal travel, faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to register with UC Away. 
• Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.
• Anyone who has currently booked or is planning to book any travel, international or domestic, should consult with her or his supervisor as soon as possible.
We ask that everyone remain informed about measures to prevent infection and regularly monitor the most up-to-date UC Merced information.

Merced,9-Mar-2020,"COVID-19 Instructional Continuity
March 9, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of the coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but currently, there is no reason for us to suspend ordinary instructional activity; in-person classroom meetings will be under normal operations.
 
The Senate leadership and academic administration have been working together on contingency plans should the COVID-19 impact our campus. The plans anticipate different levels of impact ranging from individual students or instructors who are sick and/or quarantined, and unable to attend classes, to complete closure of the campus.
 
In general, our principles are:
Placing primacy on your safety and the safety of your students;
Ensuring student completion of coursework in a timely manner;
Equitable treatment of students; and,
Use of technologies that are supported by the campus, in particular CatCourses and Zoom.
 
The application of these principles to COVID-19 related disruptions will require all of us to be flexible with deadlines, types of assignments, and modes of instructional delivery. In the meantime, we strongly encourage all instructors to do the following:
 
Talk with your students and TAs about the possibility of COVID-19 disruptions and assure them that we are prioritizing their safety and the completion of the classes. Explain that this may require the types of flexibility discussed above.
 
Determine a course of action for your class should you, a student, or the entire class need to participate remotely.
 
Familiarize yourself and your students with the functionalities of CatCourses and Zoom that may need to be used to deliver course content. The Office of Information Technology has established a website to guide you in the appropriate use of these technologies. The Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning will be available for consultation.
 
Should it be necessary, the Senate has approved a policy to be used when the Provost and the Senate Chair agree there is an emergency necessitating suspension of normal instructional operations. We will inform you if and when we are invoking the policy. The policy is available here .
 
We know you will have concerns about the welfare of your families, staff, and your research. UC Merced has established a website for COVID-19 related information and resources. The site also includes a question function that will be monitored to direct your questions to the appropriate experts.
 
Some additional resources you may find helpful include:

Merced,10-Mar-2020,"COVID-19 and Research Continuity at UC Merced
March 10, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
The Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) has established a set of business continuity plans for the research enterprise should the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impact our campus. These plans are staged, based on the severity of such impacts if they should indeed occur. Please recognize that if an outbreak of COVID-19 virus does occur in this region, the research enterprise at UC Merced may be affected.
Consistent with the continuity of educational operations, continuity of research at UC Merced is anchored in the following principles:
· personal safety for the entire campus community; and
· ensuring ongoing technical and administrative support of research operations when possible.
This will require us to be flexible with campus-based research protocol and proposal submittal deadlines. I’d like to discuss several areas of operation that could impact the research community:
1. The preparation, review and submittal of proposals can happen entirely electronically, so as long as the Departmental Research Administrators and ORED staff are not severely impacted with the virus, these activities should occur on time and without interruption.
If a number of staff are personally impacted, we will suspend all internal submittal deadlines. Under these conditions, it will not be possible to completely review all proposals prior to submittal, but they will be submitted as long as the sponsors are still accepting applications. (All federal agencies have a provision for late submittals of proposals in the event of natural disasters, including pandemics. ORED will work with extramural sponsors to address delays in research productivity resulting from and impact associated with the COVID-19 virus at UC Merced.)
The selection process for limited submission proposals will expedited if needed to ensure that proposals from UC Merced can meet the submittal deadlines posed by extramural sponsors.
2. The operation of core facilities managed by ORED will continue unless general campus operations are suspended. In the event that a particular core facility cannot accommodate your needs due to closure or the illness of the technical support staff, we will assist you in finding access to facilities at another campus if they remain open.
3. The Division of Animal Research Services (DARS, the vivarium) operates continuously, 365 days per year. DARS has a formal emergency management plan that directly addresses the topic of human disease outbreaks and pandemics. I encourage animal users to discuss this topic directly with the Campus Attending Veterinarian, Kate Clark and/or the Director of DARS, Roy Hoglund.
4. Natural Reserve System (NRS) facilities will remain open and available for use as long as general campus operations continue, however operation of the Yosemite and Sequoia Field Stations will be contingent upon the status of and access to Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks. If general campus operations are suspended, essential research-related activities may proceed at NRS facilities, as long as NRS staff are not severely impacted with the virus. Please consult with Faculty Director Jessica Blois on any questions related to your specific upcoming reserve use.
5. The Office of Research Compliance and Integrity will continue to function across its areas. If necessary, meetings of the IRB and IACUC committees can occur through video conferencing.
To reiterate: Should COVID-19 impact the Merced region, the UC Merced research enterprise may be affected. Research personnel transactions, research procurements and travel are all handled by units external to ORED. The ongoing operations of activities in these areas will likely be contingent upon the availability of staff. Please consult with your school and ORU offices to address questions in these areas. Principle investigators are encouraged to review their own research continuity plans to determine how best to handle a possible interruption of activities.

Dear Campus Community,
 
With the health and safety of our community as our highest priority during global concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), UC Merced leadership, following University of California guidance, will begin moving toward remote learning.
 
The campus is not closing, and classes are not being canceled. Instructors are encouraged to begin using digital tools like CatCourses and Zoom to offer courses remotely, when feasible.
 
Resources are available for instructors who do not have extensive experience delivering course material remotely. The Office of Information Technology has established a website to guide instructors in the appropriate use of these technologies; the provost’s office will facilitate peer training by instructors with more experience teaching remotely; and the Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning will be available for consultation as well. Given that we do not have extensive central support for making this transition, we will initially prioritize live support for instructors of the largest classes. Please be patient in asking for help and recognize that any way of delivering lectures—even by voice recording alone—is better than complete disruption of instruction.
 
The purpose of this shift to remote learning is to reduce interpersonal contact. This is a form of “social distancing” designed to help lessen the spread of the virus should it become present on our campus. Labs, performance-based courses, and those involving field work do not need to be modified at this time, though steps towards reducing the number and length of in-person meetings are still encouraged when appropriate. Instructors will manage their own courses and communicate to students as needed.
 
While we know that the average-aged college student is not at high risk for serious COVID-19 illness , even those who are very mildly ill carry the virus and potentially put others at risk. We encourage everyone in our community to take normal precautions and be considerate of others, on and off campus, particularly those in higher risk categories.
 
Campus leadership will continue to monitor developments and inform the campus community about any changes to the schedule or course delivery methodology. As always, please visit our website for the most current and credible information on COVID-19.

Merced,11-Mar-2020,"UPDATE: Moving Toward Remote Learning - Student Notification
March 11, 2020
Dear Students,
 
With the health and safety of our community as our highest priority during global concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), UC Merced leadership, following University of California guidance, will begin moving toward remote learning.
 
The campus is not closing, and classes are not being canceled. Instructors are encouraged to begin using digital tools like CatCourses and Zoom to offer courses remotely, when feasible. Your faculty will reach out to you to share course specific plans. It will be important for you to stay in communication with your instructors and continue a high level of engagement in your coursework.
 
The purpose of this shift to remote learning is to reduce interpersonal contact. This is a form of “social distancing” designed to help lessen the spread of the virus should it become present on our campus. Labs, performance-based courses, and those involving field work do not need to be modified at this time, though steps towards reducing the number and length of in-person meetings are still encouraged when appropriate.
 
UC Merced is following the guidance of UC Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . We have decided to implement these procedures prior to learning of any cases in Merced County. That is to say, we are putting the safety of students, faculty, and staff first, and are doing our part to help control the spread of the disease proactively.
 
While we are moving course instruction online, the residence halls and the Pavilion will remain open. We have modified service in the Pavilion, to eliminate self-service, increase opportunities for to-go meals, and arrange for proxy meal pick up for students who are ill. The campus has increased cleaning, particularly of commonly used surfaces and in high traffic areas, such as the Pavilion and the Gallo Recreation and Wellness Center. We will be installing more hand sanitation dispensers around campus in an effort to promote healthy preventative behaviors across campus.
 
While we know that the average-aged college student is not at high risk for serious COVID-19 illness , even those who are so mildly ill as to be asymptomatic carry the virus and potentially put others at risk. We encourage everyone in our community to take normal precautions and be considerate of others, on and off campus, particularly those in higher risk categories.
 
Additionally, I know these changes may cause some stress and uncertainty. Please bear with us while we manage this complicated transition. Counseling services are available for students through Counseling and Psychological Services , as well as online through Live Health , a service through Student Health .

March 11, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
We are continuing to monitor developments in the global COVID-19 outbreak. As of today, we are aware of no reported cases at UC Merced or in Merced County.
Campus remains open for all business functions. Faculty have been encouraged, where feasible, to offer course material remotely, but classes continue, and our students remain on campus. This of course means services such as dining, cleaning and instruction must continue without interruption. We would like to extend special recognition to all staff who are working long hours to help our campus stay healthy and operational, particularly our food service and custodial and maintenance staffs.
We continue to follow University of California guidance on how COVID-19 may impact staff. Our campus also coordinates closely with UC Health, state and county health officials. We know UC Merced employees may have questions, and Human Resources has posted these frequently asked questions for your reference. The simplest general guidance is to check with your manager or supervisor about expectations.
For those experiencing anxiety about global developments, UC Merced offers a robust Employee Assistance Program through Insight EAP. You may reach out to them directly at 800-422-5322 or email insighteap@insighteap.com for more information or to set up an appointment.
Please keep our Principles of Community in mind as we move through this period together, and remember to check UC Merced’s COVID-19 page, updated several times daily with the university’s latest communications and credible sources of information.

Merced,12-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Guidance on Large Gatherings; Updated Campus Efforts
March 12, 2020
To Our Campus Community,
We know that social distancing will be important should we face any COVID-19 outbreak. But we must re-emphasize that as of today we are not aware of any confirmed cases at UC Merced or in Merced County.
In our ongoing efforts to keep our campus informed about COVID-19 (coronavirus) developments, we are issuing new guidance and direction about campus events and meetings, effective until April 20, and also greatly broadening our campus cleaning efforts
Effective immediately, events expected to draw more than 100 attendees should be cancelled or indefinitely postponed unless they can be moved to an online platform.
Non-essential meetings and campus visits involving groups of more than 15 people should be cancelled or postponed unless they can be held online. This includes, for example, campus tours.
Campus faculty and staff should consider using Zoom or other tools to hold internal meetings.
If conditions change in our region, event organizers should discuss plans for smaller events with Merced County health officials in advance. 
For those living, learning and working on our campus:
Dining services has added crews on disinfecting shifts, has ordered and is placing disinfecting dispensers at the front of all dining halls, has placed orders for 10 weeks’ worth of cleaning chemicals and has purchased masks for staff members to use during food preparation.
All food service workers are being reminded to be extra diligent about regular hand washing.
We will retain cleaning crew members over spring break for additional heavy cleaning and disinfecting. 
We are providing a higher level of sanitation for campus public areas such as building entries, lobbies, restrooms, classrooms, teaching laboratories, libraries, dining halls and other spaces where a large number of people are present or pass through daily. 
In addition, we are expanding the locations and number of hand-sanitizing stations across campus.
Finally, we are also sharing educational information across campus outlining the actions all members of the community can take to promote sanitary environments, including by email, postering and table-top cards.
Please continue to check our COVID-19 information page for updates and links to sources of credible information.
Thank you,

Merced,13-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Updated Travel Restrictions
March 13, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Due to increasing concern regarding COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) and arising from our responsibility to keep our community healthy and safe, please find below reminders and updates to UC Merced guidance and University of California directives for all travel.
All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmission), must be submitted in writing to Risk Manager Cindi Zimmerman for approval by Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Gregg Camfield prior to scheduling travel. Check the CDC website for the latest information before traveling.
This is consistent with UC President Janet Napolitano’s directive to avoid all non-essential travel to CDC Level 3 and 2 countries.
All non-essential visits to campus by visitors from Level 3 or Level 2 countries are postponed until further notice.
All university-related international travel must be registered with UC Away (also called the UC International Travel Registry). UC Away is the University of California’s portal to register university-related and personal travel.
Registration enables the university to leverage benefits and protections in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential services.
The university has curtailed all non-essential domestic or international travel until further notice.
If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.
If you decide to travel outside the United States, please be aware that the U.S. government may issue new international travel regulations with minimum notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry.
The university strongly recommends that domestic travel be registered with UC Away; this includes both university-related and personal travel.
For university-related domestic travel booked through UC Connexxus, trips are automatically registered with UC Away. However, travel booked through other means will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
For personal travel, faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to register with UC Away. 
Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.
As general good practice, anyone who has currently booked or is planning to book any travel, international or domestic, should consult with her or his supervisor as soon as possible.
We ask that everyone remain informed about measures to prevent infection and regularly check the following website for the most up-to-date UC Merced information.

Merced,13-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Telecommuting Guidelines
March 13, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The health and safety of our campus community remain our foremost concern as we all explore ways to maintain campus operations during the nation’s response to COVID-19. We are committed to doing all we can to mitigate the spread of this virus into our community.
In coordination with the University of California and other campuses, UC Merced is issuing guidance on remote working arrangements for employees during this period of heightened concern. The full guidance can be found on the Human Resources page on the Emergency Management website.
Supervisors must determine how best to designate staff for their units’ success.“Designated staff” are those who are not eligible to telecommute; these staff members must perform their jobs on campus to:
Ensure the health and safety of the campus community;
Provide direct customer service that cannot be performed from another location;
Ensure critical continuity of operations on campus that cannot be performed from another location;
Respond timely to an emergency.
Approaches could include flexible work schedules, such as fewer but longer workdays, or alternating staff between on-site and telecommuting work. The guidance document suggests several potential approaches.
In determining a remote working arrangement:
Supervisors must document individual agreements. A form for documenting that agreement can be found on the Human Resources page of the Emergency site.
The documentation must include duration of the arrangement, days and hours, location and contact information.
Employees must abide by all normal workplace rules such as meal breaks, advance approval of overtime and approval of sick, vacation or other leave.
Employees must be able to ensure they are working in a safe environment and can protect university records and equipment.
Supervisors must treat workers equitably.
As always, our spirit of community will go a long way here toward coming to agreeable resolutions that balance the university’s and employees’ needs. Human Resources staff remain available to assist with any discussions or special circumstances.
Remember that all university communications and links to credible sources of information can be found on our COVID-19 website.

Merced,14-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Weekly Briefing from the Chancellor
March 23, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered Californians to stay at home indefinitely as health care providers and public officials work to minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Educational institutions like UC Merced are subject to this order, but it is important to note that our campus remains operational. Many functions will be performed remotely, including instruction, which is being delivered as our students continue to make progress toward their degrees. For the few students who remain on campus, we will continue to provide essential services.
We understand that each new announcement from university leadership about the coronavirus creates challenges and anxieties. And now our community is called upon to comply with new guidance, the implications of which we are still exploring with state officials. We appreciate your patience as we navigate these unfamiliar waters together.
We have notified you that two students who reported symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results while under self-quarantine, one on campus and one in a private home. We have no new information on either case at this time, but we will share any updates as we receive them.
We also want to call attention to the unparalleled cooperation and coordination of local, state and federal officials. Congressman Jim Costa has kept us updated on the latest federal thinking and plans. We are grateful to Assembly Member Adam Gray, Merced County and City of Merced officials, and the Merced County Department of Public Health in particular for their advice and assistance.
During this time, campus will operate similar to winter break — only a few core services will be operating, and very few students will be in residence.
Below is a summary of operations we have determined to be essential:
Academic instruction (now offered remotely).
Student housing and dining services, which will continue for a small number of students who remain on campus.
Student health services.
Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels.
Approved research activities.
Emergency response, such as police and environmental health and safety.
IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning.
Human resources, finance and the Employee Assistance Program for employees.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for students, via telehealth. Students can contact CAPS 24/7 at (209) 228-4266 for assistance.
This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential services and employees designated to be on campus will be distributed by supervisors.
In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, here is a running list of communications to faculty, students and staff. All of these, as well as FAQs updated daily and critical resources, are available at emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus.
Some important points to remember:
Essential activity, including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence, is permitted by the governor’s order. Travel abroad is prohibited.
Students may remain in housing only if necessary.
Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave or have been asked to work remotely. Employees with questions and concerns can always contact your supervisor, Human Resources, or the University Ombuds Office.
Do not come to campus to conduct research unless specifically approved.
Events, including commencement, have been cancelled or postponed, and meetings should be limited or conducted in a safe manner.
We are proud of the way everyone at UC Merced — students, faculty and staff — has stepped up during our response to this global crisis: with safety and wellness at the fore, with energy and passion, with thoughtfulness and deliberation. Thank you for all you have done and all you do to prove yet again that this university truly is the great institution, and great community, we have always aspired to be.
We want to assure every member of our community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on our COVID-19 information page.
Sincerely,

Merced,16-Mar-2020,"March 16, 2020To all Graduate Students and Post-Doctoral Scholars (and copying Graduate Group Chairs and School Deans),I know that this is a time of immense stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. All of us at UC Merced are trying to maximize safety and flexibility.In terms of general guidance on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it, please see https://emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus. I also recommend this article that lays out the science of the need to act quickly: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99caand Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths(behind a paywall).I want to respond to a number of questions that have come to me, so please bear with me as this is a somewhat lengthy note.The situation is very fluid, and responses that I provide today may be outdated in a day or two. I will do my best to keep you informed as we move forward during this emergency. Your Scholarly Activities After spring break, all courses—graduate and undergraduate—will be conducted via remote teaching methods for the remainder of the Spring Semester. The faculty remain in full control of the curriculum and are encouraged to redesign their teaching methods as appropriate given the emergency nature of these changes. We are aware of the particular impact junior scholars face from disruptions to their fieldwork, potentially failed experiments, delays in completion of deadlines now that they are caring for children at home, navigating a distance-based world, and so on. For now, we have asked faculty to think carefully about what work can be done while engaging in appropriate social distancing. We also know that research productivity is being interrupted due to the COVID 19 emergency, and that this may delay your progress towards academic goals, including time to degree. Please be assured that your faculty and the Graduate Division will take these unusual circumstances into consideration in reviewing your progress.Major graduate exams (e.g., advancements, qualifying exams, thesis/dissertation defenses) may all be held virtually. The Graduate Division and Office of Information Technology are working together to make this as simple as possible for you. The forms required for these exams may all be signed and delivered digitally(wet signatures will not be required). For those of you working with human subjects or animal subjects, please be sure to read the following notices, which provide the most current guidance:COVID-19 Humans Subjects Research GuidanceCOVID-19 Animal Subjects Research GuidanceWhatever type of research you conduct, please document changes in protocols so you can write up your methods sections of papers appropriately. Depending on the changes, you may also need to have your modified protocols approved by appropriate review board (see guidance above).Your EmploymentYour employment in Spring will NOT be reduced in response to COVID-19 planning. GSRs:GSRs are asked to work with their PIs to ensure maximum social distancing is taking place, given the work you do. Please try to work from home when you can, spread out in labs, and minimize close contact with others. Start with making contingency plans for research continuity with your PI. If that doesn’t work out or you do not feel comfortable having those conversations, please reach out to your Graduate Group Chair, graduate support staff in the schools, or Maria Nishanian (mnishanian@ucmerced.edu-academic counselor in the Graduate Division) to help you. The faculty have received additional guidance from the Office of Research. Should there be disruptions to operations, the University may have limited ability to assist with research continuity issues. For example, the availability of supplies may lag during the resolution of a health crisis.While the campus plans to provide researchers with access to their space until such a time as it is deemed to be unsafe or is prohibited by state or federal directives, researchers should be prepared for a partial or total cessation of all laboratory-based research. As outlined in a directive from the UC Office of the President,in no event should researchers take reagents, chemicals, biologics or any other laboratory equipment or materials other than laptops, data storage devices,etc., offsite (e.g.,to their homes) during a curtailment. Should there be a closure, it is expected that you will continue to work with your PI on research projects—writing up literature reviews, planning for next grants, etc. TAs:As you know, teaching assistants are under contract to work a set number of hours, depending on the percentage of appointment. After Spring Break, ALLinstructional activity will be delivered remotely. This includes all types of instructional formats –seminars, laboratories, etc. –and all forms of assessments –exams, tests, quizzes, performances, etc.Many faculty simply do not know how much time particular tasks may take or how much undergraduates may be reaching out to you. Please keep your instructor of record informed of your work schedule in the event that they need to step in and do additional work themselves, or request additional resources from their department. The Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning has a number of resources available to you on their website. We encourage use of Zoom and CatCourses, and remind you not to use tools that require payment by students,collect personal information (including biometrics) from students,or put any student information (e.g., grades or test scores) on non-UC Merced systems. Please do not use YouTube to deliver instruction, as UCOP has specifically disallowed it for UC educational purposes.You may also consult the Educational Continuity site for Faculty and Instructors and the Educational Continuity site for students for additional resources. TA’s are encouraged to schedule consultationson using various technologies for remote instruction.International Research and TravelInternational graduate students needing to travel for any reason should be in touch with the International Affairs Office. As of March 12, 2020, the university has curtailed all non-essential domestic or international travel until further notice, and most domestic and international conferences are cancelled. Contact your sponsor regarding refunds for cancellations. If you must travel, please register all University related business travel with UC Away, which allows the University to provide aid to you if something were to happen to you or within your destination country, regardless of nature, and the UC will work to get you back to the U.S. at no cost to you. If travel reservations were made using the University Connexxus Travel program, trip registration in UC Away is automatic. Research in foreign locations should be paused due to current travel restrictions. All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmfission),must have prior approval from Risk Servicesand the Provost’s office before making travel arrangements. Please consult UC President Napolitano’s most recent travel directive for more information.Your WellbeingThis is a difficult, stressful time. Please remember to be kind to others, and to yourself, and to remember our Principles of Community. Globally, stress, anxiety, and worry are high. Now, more than ever, is the time to care for one another and to remember the inclusive and supportive culture we have all worked so hard to build for so long together. Please remember that UC Merced has no tolerance for bullying or discrimination. In an emergency, call 911. If not an emergency, contact the UC Merced Health Center and Counseling and Psychological Services if you need them. The Advice Nurse may be reached at 209-228-4192, 9 a.m. -4:30p.m. Monday-Friday, excluding holidays or campus closure dates. If your call goes to voicemail, leave a message and the advice nurse will get back to you promptly. You can also use our secured messaging system for non-emergent matters throughmyHealth. To speak to an advice nurse after clinic hours contact 209-228-2273 and follow the prompts to speak to an after-hours nurse. Students covered by UC SHIP can call the 24/7 nurse line 24-hours a day, seven days a week and speak confidentially to a registered nurse. These nurses are trained to help you make more informed decisions about your health situation. This number is also on the back of your member ID card. We encourage you to take a break during Spring Break and get some rest. We strongly encourage you NOT to do any non-essential travel during the break. Should you choose to leave Merced,please be prepared not to return, given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. Let me also pass on the following recommendations from my colleague at UC Irvine: •Have zoom dates with friends. This can be a good time to totally decompress or to chat with people about your research. You can even have remote writing hangouts, and we will host some of these through the GPSRC.•Get outside! Although we do not recommend touching playgrounds, park benches, and so on without a good scrub, going outside for a walk, run, or just to sit in the open air for a few minutes can make a big difference. Please look out for and help your friends with chronic illnesses and/or disabilities. Just getting out might not be as simple for everyone. •Create structure for yourself so you can feel productive and engaged in your work while at home. Divide your work into tasks that take at most 90 minutes, rather than a full day labeled “write dissertation.”•Brainstorm best practices with your friends and share them online through Google docs, Slack, or whatever else you want to try.•For those of you caring for kids, parents, or partners during this time, don’t be alone, even if you are physically isolated. Have a virtual date via video call.Check in with an online support group. On behalf of all of us in the Graduate Division, please do all you can to stay healthy and safe and to keep your loved ones safe. In turn, we will do all we can to minimize disruptions so you can continue with all your successes!My best to all,Marjorie S.

Merced,16-Mar-2020,"At Our Best: Embodying the Principles of Community
March 16, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Over the past few weeks with the evolving COVID-19 situation, our community has faced something many of us have never experienced before. We appreciate the efforts of those on the front lines, both on our campus and around the world.
During these uncertain times, we are all being asked to do more, take on more and be there for each other more. I have witnessed the care and connection that happens when we show up for each other, and it is that deep sense of community that runs throughout and keeps us going.
UC Merced’s power lies in our commitment to a culture that is founded on unity and respect and a community that affirms the inherent dignity and value of every person. This is embodied in our Principles of Community and enacted in our lives and our work every day.
In global health emergencies, fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, which has no room in our community and no part in uncovering the solutions to our challenges. While the CDC has provided much guidance, they have also included resources to reducing stigma , which can also be found on our Emergency Preparedness page.
We actively denounce and discourage xenophobia, bigotry and racism and actively reinforce treating all in our community with respect. If you are being harassed or discriminated against, or if you are a bystander who has witnessed such a situation, please report the incident here .
Amidst all the cancellations and postponements, I wanted to continue to hold a space for you to feel connected. So I will be holding my monthly drop-in hours via Zoom — you can RSVP here and come as you are. This is a space for informal dialogue about anything you would like to discuss. My office is deeply thinking about how we can continue to build belonging through this landscape, so please stay tuned.
We are at our best when we are there for each other and prioritizing community and humanity beyond our routines. I truly believe in our best.

Merced,16-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Academics Moving to Remote Instruction
March 16, 2020
Dear Colleagues:
 
Thank you for your energetic and collaborative responses to the COVID-19 crisis. We have heard stories of the creativity manifested by departments and programs in working together to maintain instructional continuity. Clearly, you have both a sense of urgency to be responsive to the crisis and a sense of the importance of providing the best education possible in the circumstance.
 
That said, the situation has evolved so quickly that we now must move from encouraging you to requiring you to move to distance delivery of curriculum. We are now going to resume ALL instructional activity after spring break through distance delivery.
 
On Monday March 30, students will engage in all coursework remotely. This includes all types of instructional formats – seminars, laboratories, etc. – and all forms of assessments – exams, tests, quizzes, performances, etc.
 
Additionally, given how many counties are now imposing travel restrictions, some students who went home for the weekend will not be able to return to campus this week. Therefore, we will NOT make this week’s sessions for any in-person classes mandatory. That includes lab, studio, and small classes.
 
We will maintain distance learning through the rest of the spring semester.
 
The Academic Senate is in the process of amending its Emergency Course Continuity Policy to allow for this.
 
We are urging this step to support “social distancing” as well as to provide students with the certainty they need to make decisions about where to reside for spring break and the post-spring break period.
 
Both the Office of Information Technologies (OIT) and the Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning have done excellent work to develop tools to help you move your courses. That said, our ability to support in person every instructor to make this transition is beyond our ability. As such,
 
Do-it-yourself resources continue to be available on the campus’ Educational Continuity website for instructors ;
Instructors, including teaching assistants, may sign up for workshops and individual consultations via the “Schedule a Consultation with the Academic and Emerging Technologies Team” tab under “Finding Help”;
Department chairs and/or deans can direct you to faculty members with online instructional experience who are willing to assist; and
We are in the process of developing ways to manage exams.
 
Zoom
 
For those of you awaiting an individual Zoom account, accounts will be provisioned individually. UC Merced has also obtained an enterprise license that will allow faculty, students and staff to log into a Zoom account via Single SignOn using their UC Merced NetID. The OIT will be working to get that set up throughout this week and announce when it is available. Zoom allows up to 300 participants.
 
Students
 
If you have not already, please communicate to your students your plan for moving the course to remote delivery. Students will need support as they engage in technologies and learning modalities that may be new to them. Toward this end, an Educational Continuity for Students website has been established. We encourage you to review it and direct your students to it, as relevant. As you implement learning at a distance, regular contact with your students will help them succeed in the absence of a normal academic structure.
 
Flexible Approaches to Remote Instruction
 
We also continue to urge:
Use of campus supported technologies like Zoom and CatCourses; and
Asynchronous instructional strategies or low band-width synchronous approaches (e.g. Zoom audio only) to address anticipated demand for Zoom and CatCourses.
 
Planning for Illness
 
Should you become ill and unable to teach your courses, let your department or program chair know immediately. Departments will be responsible to maintain instructional continuity in such cases.
 
In closing, we thank you for your patience with this quickly evolving and fluid situation. Please take appropriate measures to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and healthy--physically and mentally.
 
Please be kind to yourself, your colleagues and staff.

Merced,16-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Research Continuity
March 16, 2020
Faculty,
Over the coming days and weeks there is a potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to affect research on the UC Merced campus. Some areas that may be affected are disruptions to the supply chain with limited campus delivery and a slowdown of the production of reagents and consumables internationally. Travel for academic conferences, workshops and field activities have been and will continue to be impacted. With these considerations, we have identified a series of issues for your consideration and recommendations for preparedness in research laboratories. As this is a fluid situation, we have built a Research Continuity page on the Emergency Preparedness website where these recommendations will be continually updated as quickly as possible as new information is available.
While this guidance attempts to address a variety of circumstances, all faculty and researchers should discuss contingency plans with their Deans and Department Chairs, as well as with students and staff under their supervision to ensure research continuity. Should there be disruptions to operations, the University may have limited ability to assist with research continuity issues.
Researchers should be prepared for a partial or total cessation of all laboratory based research. Please review the guidance below on Laboratory preparations.
It is our intent to provide researchers with access to their space until such a time as it is deemed to be unsafe or is prohibited by state or federal directives. As outlined in a directive from the UC Office of the President, in no event should researchers take reagents, chemicals, biologics or any other laboratory equipment or materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes) to ensure research continuity during a curtailment.
All faculty should familiarize themselves with these guidelines. Below is a bulleted list of potential circumstances covered on the Research Continuity page.

Merced,16-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Campus Update
March 16, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
An undergraduate student at UC Merced has reported symptoms today consistent with COVID-19 and is awaiting test results. We wanted to share this with our campus community. 
The university is working to identify those with whom this student may have had contact and will work with Merced County health officials as required. The student is self-quarantined.
We remain committed to the health and safety of every member of our campus and will continue to provide updates as we have them.
Remember to maintain personal hygiene, and keep up to date with guidance from UC Merced, the University of California, the CDC and other credible sources of information at our COVID-19 Emergency Management site. And please take care of yourselves and those around you; our community remains our great source of strength.

Merced,17-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Spring Break Guidance for Students
March 17, 2020
Dear Students,
 
Today we have informed faculty that all instructional activity until the end of the semester is to be offered remotely and to transition all our courses to some form of available instruction. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority.
 
As was shared in earlier communication, we are committed to ensuring students have every opportunity to fulfill their academic commitments and continue to progress toward their degrees and their careers. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to all students in non-lecture courses and settings; that will be complete by the start of spring break. Students should reach out to their faculty members if they have questions about how courses will be delivered.
 
Any students who went home over the weekend to the California counties that have imposed travel restrictions, and are now under a shelter-in-place order, are exempt from attendance requirements for in-person classes this week. This includes lab, studio and small classes.
 
We have also developed a resource page for you, as students, on tips and pointers to best engage in this learning environment.
 
Information for Students Who Stay on Campus
 
My earlier email confirmed that our residence halls and a dining facility will stay open, including during spring break. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break, and we are increasing sanitization efforts in common areas and strengthening our broadband to support online learning to help ensure a safe and healthy environment for students living on campus.
 
It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing both in the residence halls and the dining facilities. Please rest assured, we will support you in your decision about where it is best for you to reside during this public health emergency.
 
Information for Students Who Move Out
 
If you live on campus in one of our residence halls, you will receive relief from your campus housing and dining fees if you decide to move out. The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts for students who decide to move out of campus housing for the remainder of this academic year. The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid, based upon the effective move-out date.
 
Students who want to move out must complete a written request. The campus will process two move-out dates, March 20 and March 30, depending on when you formally check out of your residence hall. The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student’s housing costs are covered by financial aid or remaining balances on an account.
 
Here is the portal for reporting your intention: https://ucmerced.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalx/
 
And a video explaining the process: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/b1ec2cc6-4ce5-4eba-bad2-f182b9bd918c
 
Information for Student Employees
 
We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs, yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. New guidance regarding all staff employees was issued today by the UC Office of the President, and UC Merced Human Resources will soon be distributing guidance for our campus, including student employees.
 
Help Us ‘Flatten the Curve’
 
Currently there are no reported positive cases of COVID-19 in Merced County, nor any related to members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated Emergency Operations team, and Student Health Services staff, and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely and will keep you updated.
 
Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “ flatten the curve ,” and slow the spread of COVID-19 , respect those around you in accordance with our Principles of Community , stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus , and be well.

March 17, 2020
Dear UC Merced Parents and Families,
 
As you know, news about the global COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly, and at UC Merced we are attempting to keep our community informed not only about campus preparations and directives but also about University of California policies and guidance from government agencies. Going forward, we ask you to check our Emergency Management site for the latest information, as well as archives of campus communications and other resources.
 
A reminder: Campus is open and campus offices remain operational. Classes are not canceled, but faculty are moving to fully remote delivery of courses by the end of spring break — options include online classes, video lectures and the like. Faculty and students should be communicating regularly as we make this transition, to ensure education continues as effectively as possible.
 
We have also posted brief videos, in English and Spanish , specifically for parents, as well as a special message from Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Charles Nies.
 
On March 16, an undergraduate student reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but the student has not tested positive. We notified the campus community and the student has self-quarantined.
 
In the past week, we have sent several messages to our campus, including:
 
Educational continuity: Faculty have been instructed to offer remote learning tools for all courses. All classes will be offered via remote delivery by the end of spring break.
 
Staff telecommuting: Campus offices must maintain operations, but supervisors in many units have flexibility in how to do so, in discussion with employees. Additional guidance on this will be going out about this today.
 
Events and meetings: Large events (over 100) are canceled. We are tracking all campus events with daily updates.
 
Our Principles of Community: The value of our community spirit.
 
We have also communicated with the wider community in many other ways — you may find some of this information instructive or useful as well:
 
Campus leadership Q&A This event was livestreamed on March 11 from campus.
 
ABC30 (Fresno TV) story on UC Merced preparations.
 
Los Angeles Times story on UC campuses mobilizing.
KVPR (Valley Public Radio) discussion panel on preparations.
 
Merced County Times story on Merced-area institutions’ plans.
 
We will support students in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break, and we will maintain all student support operations. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to increase social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.).
 
If you have specific questions, you can ask through the button at the top of our home page; questions are monitored daily and answered as quickly as possible.
 
Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “ flatten the curve ,” and slow the spread of COVID-19 , stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus , and be well.

Merced,17-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Employee Guidance
March 17, 2020
Dear Employees,
 
On March 16, President Napolitano released an Executive Order that critical steps must be taken to limit the exposure of members of our community to the disease within our community, to care for those who have fallen ill or otherwise been exposed, and to assure the continued functioning of critical operations.
 
Effective immediately, all “non-designated” UC Merced employees will work remotely 100% of the time.
 
Division heads should designate employee groups who are not eligible, or have limited ability to telecommute, and create plans to reduce the on-site density of employees as much as possible.
 
“Designated employees” are those who are not eligible for, or have limited ability to, telecommute. These employees must perform their jobs on campus to:
Ensure the health and safety of the campus community.
Provide direct customer service that cannot be performed from another location.
Ensure critical continuity of operations on campus that cannot be performed from another location.
Respond timely to an emergency.
 
Temporary Telecommute Agreements should be executed for eligible employees to achieve this goal. This Agreement should be used in all instances where management has determined that work may temporarily be performed from home or at an alternate location during this crisis.
There is no set duration for these agreements, but they should be reviewed at least every 30 days.
 
In situations where designated employees can work temporarily from home or from an alternate location, we ask that managers work to identify these opportunities, implement them as soon as possible, and document them in a Temporary Telecommute Agreement.
 
For all non-designated employees, we ask that supervisors execute Temporary Telecommute Agreements that reflect 100% remote work as soon as possible.
 
Managers and supervisors should determine
The positions and tasks where work can be performed remotely.
The appropriate level of work for telecommuters and how work will be assigned and how performance is measured.
The working days, hours, and times of work on telecommuting days.
Availability and methods of communication for employees who are telecommuting.
 
For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented and student workers), managers and employees should develop a work plan for those special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training that could be completed remotely.
 
Departments may enter into telecommuting arrangements with the approval of the department head and in consultation with the respective dean or vice chancellor, who is responsible for documenting the division’s workflow and ensuring Temporary Telecommute Agreements are in place.
 
Paid Administrative Leave
 
All employees are eligible for a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject to these conditions:
All hours must be used by Dec. 31, 2020.
he hours may be used intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, as long as this doesn’t adversely affect the delivery of essential university services.
The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time will be prorated according to the percent of the appointment.
Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for this one-time allotment of the paid administrative leave.
 
The paid administrative leave may be used only:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID-19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the worksite has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program, or is under a shelter in place order and it is not feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
 
We encourage managers and supervisors read the full guidance on remote working arrangements and determine who must be designated to remain.
 
Even for designated employees, the university recommends meetings be held using Zoom or another tool that provides for social distancing. Following recent federal guidance, we strong discourage in-person gatherings of more than 10 people.
 
Remember to visit UC Merced’s COVID-19 Emergency Management site for updates, all university communications and credible sources of health and safety information. Please continue to practice hand washing and social distancing, and take care of yourself and one another.

Merced,18-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Employee Information and Resources
March 18, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
In an effort to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our UC Merced community as we navigate COVID-19 together, I would like to share with you detailed information and guidance to help inform your actions in response to the coronavirus and mitigate its potential impacts on your professional and personal lives.
 
Working from Home
 
Leaders across campus have transitioned staff to full-time telecommute, retaining only limited on-site operations for critical functions. In most cases, telecommuting applies to administrative staff that are “non-designated.” Each leader is working with her/his respective managers and supervisors to communicate a workplan for the unit. The telecommuting initiative will stay in effect for approximately 30 days and will be re-evaluated as needed.
 
During this period, staff working from home are expected to be fully available for meetings and responsive to requests during normal business hours. There are many useful tools and resources to help employees stay connected, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business, among others. Check with your supervisor to see what your unit is utilizing.
 
Additional telecommuting resources can be found here .
 
Working Onsite
 
While many staff will be working from home, there are critical operations on campus that cannot be completed remotely. For those employees who are designated to be on campus, we thank you for being on the front lines and continuing to come to work during these unprecedented circumstances. Please be sure to safeguard your own health and that of others by taking personal precautions and practicing social distancing.
 
COVID-19 Administrative Leave
 
In accordance with President Napolitano’s Executive Order , effective March 1 through Dec. 31, 2020, employees will be eligible to receive up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave in order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
These hours can only be used with prior approval from your supervisor and are designed to assist you if, for example: you or a family member becomes ill with COVID-19; you cannot come to work because of a COVID-19 related school or daycare closure; or you have been directed not to come into work for COVID-19 related reasons but you and your supervisor determine that it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely.
 
These hours are only for employees who are unable to work, either on campus or remotely, because of hardships related to COVID-19. Please be mindful that many staff are urgently needed at this time to maintain the critical operations of the university, and that the use of these special administrative leave hours requires supervisor approval.
 
Recording and Coding of Administrative Leave
 
Paid administrative leave is intended to cover an employees regularly scheduled hours of work when an employee is impacted by their own COVID-19 related illness or meets other leave criteria outlined above. Employees who are less than 100% time will have their available hours prorated based on their regular work schedule.
 
Hourly paid employees who are working — either remotely or in the office — will continue to report their actual hours worked in the Time Reporting System (TRS). If you and your supervisor have determined use of the paid administrative leave is applicable, please use the provided code of 'Paid Leave (COVID19)' to report all hours subject to the leave.
 
Monthly paid employees will continue to report leave time — sick, vacation, etc. — in the Time Reporting System (TRS), including applicable use of authorized paid administrative leave. Employees will use the provided code of 'Paid Leave (COVID19)' in full day increments when applicable.
 
The 'Paid Leave (COVID19)' code will be available in the Time Reporting System (TRS) on or before the next bi-weekly timesheet due date of March 21, 2020.
 
Wellness Resources
 
We understand that members of our staff may be worried about the virus and may be experiencing heightened feelings of fear and anxiety. Here are some resources available to you to help with challenges surrounding this pandemic.
 
INSIGHT Employee Assistant Program (EAP) provides access to free, confidential counseling services for you or your family. You can contact them 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 800-422-5322 or via this link.
 
The INSIGHT EAP is a short-term, confidential counseling and referral service designed to help you and your eligible household family members resolve personal problems that may be interfering with your work and home life. UC Merced has arranged with Insight to provide EAP services to you at no cost. A summary of benefits includes:
 
Three no-cost counseling visits every six months;
Legal and financial consultations;
Web resource library in domains of health, wellness, personal, legal, financial and more.
 
When scheduling an appointment, please advise that you are calling through Insight EAP. Once the appointment is scheduled, call Insight back to advise which provider you selected so Insight may send an authorization. Once Insight EAP sends the provider your authorization, you will not need to present anything further at the appointment date. In most cases, once you have exhausted your EAP benefit, you can use your standard health benefit and corresponding co-payment to continue seeing the clinician.
 
Telehealth options are available. If you’d like to avoid going into the doctor’s office, all UC health plans offer phone and/or video options for getting medical advice and care. See below for more information about what your plan offers:





Additionally, we know that many of our staff are suddenly finding themselves in need of backup child care. Bright Horizons Care Advantage is a web-based resource to help you find and select pre-screened care for children, adults — even pets. You select the caregiver that’s right for you. Access to this resource is one of the benefits of working for UC Merced, but you are responsible for paying for the care or services you select.
 
Finally, but very important, please protect your health with these tips to prevent illness from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and review this help from UC health plans . If you do feel sick or have been in contact with others who are ill, please notify your manager and make sure you are following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on What to Do if You’re Sick .
 
I urge you to take good care of yourselves and support one another. We will continue to review these programs as often as necessary and will communicate any changes with you.
 
Thank you for your tireless dedication and resourcefulness. Working together, we will get through this difficult period.

March 18, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The COVID-19 pandemic is requiring constant adjustment and change for everyone. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as our operations continue to adjust in response to current recommendations and requirements.
Effective immediately, each principal investigator (PI) or research group leader of a laboratory research program (experimental, computational or otherwise) should prepare a strategy to ramp down campus laboratory research activities, with the expectation that if a closure occurs, suspended lab access will likely last at least six to eight weeks.
If a campus closure is ordered by government officials, the default assumption is that all research activities will cease by a time designated in the closure order, unless that research is deemed essential and those individuals conducting that research are designated as essential research personnel. All PIs will have the opportunity to request that their research activities be designated as essential.
Please review this detailed memo for information on research operations, essential classification and how to proceed. A checklist is also available to help you prepare for a potential campus closure.

Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced’s Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is making several changes to campus parking and bus transit, to be responsive to rapidly changing conditions and out of concern for our community’s health and well-being.
 
CatTracks will continue to operate regular service through Friday, March 20. Spring break routes for March 21-27 are available on the TAPS website. TAPS will continually assess CatTracks and Route UC services, and will update you if circumstances change.
 
TAPS has also made several changes to parking payments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
 
Faculty, staff and graduate students on a payroll deduction plan who will not come to campus during the pandemic can go to the TAPS website and complete the “Payroll Cancellation” form. Once completed, the cancellation form should be emailed to TAPS to deactivate parking permissions and corresponding payroll deductions.
 
Graduate students who have prepaid with cash, check or charge should email TAPS and elect to cancel their current parking permit. The refunded amount will be the prorated balance from the date of the request.
 
Faculty, staff and graduate students who elect to reinstate existing parking permissions prior to July 1 should contact TAPS to reactivate parking and reinstate payroll deductions.
 
Until further notice, TAPS will suspend permit requirements for undergraduate/commuter students.
 
Current, valid permits of students who prepaid will be canceled. The monthly rate for undergraduate parking for AY 2019-20 is equivalent to $33 per month, and students will be refunded $50 for April 1 through May 15 (minus any outstanding parking citations posted to a student’s record). Refunds will be made directly to the student’s account/bill. Please do not visit the TAPS office to process parking refunds.
 
Please contact TAPS at taps@ucmerced.edu or 209-228-8277 with questions regarding transportation and parking services.

Merced,20-Mar-2020,"To all Graduate Students, Graduate Group Chairs, Faculty,As long as in-person student and faculty meetings are suspended on campus, qualifying exam committees and thesis defense committees are encouraged to work with candidates to arrange for oral portions of exams and defenses to be conducted remotely and synchronously if at all possible, and to consider asynchronous alternatives if necessary. Arrangements should be made with the understanding that real-time presentations and synchronous discussions are difficult to conduct remotely, and this difficulty may affect the examination process. Students and faculty should take measures to minimize the potentially detrimental effect of remote interactions. The Graduate Division offers the following suggestions to help:•For examinations as well as regular committee meetings, students and faculty should use Zoom or other social media platforms like Skype and Microsoft Teams, depending on individual preferences. The campus has now acquired a site license for Zoom Pro and all faculty, staff and students will be proactively provisioned in the next few days. Watch your email for a confirmation from Zoom.•Zoom has several functions that may be useful during examination, including screen sharing, chat messaging, virtual whiteboarding, and virtual hand raising. OIT/CETL offers 1-1 consultation on Digital Tools for Thesis Defense which includes using Zoom. Use this link to sign up. •It may be helpful for the candidate and committee to do a test Zoom session beforehand to ensure that all the desired functions are working, and everyone knows how to use them. OIT also offers group Workshops on Using Zoom. Use this link to sign up. •Committee members should ensure that functions are working while the candidate is presenting, and all members should be prepared to pause the candidate if they notice a malfunction (the chat and virtual hand functions may still work if the audio and video signals are not working).•If only audio conferencing will be used, the candidate should distribute slides and any other visual materials beforehand, in an agreed-upon format.•Committee members should have an agreed-upon protocol for managing questions during and after presentations. It may be helpful for the Chair to coordinate questions explicitly rather than “open the floor” toquestions.•After the presentation and questions are done, the candidate can leave the Zoom session while the committee deliberates and then invited back by e.g. email when deliberations are done.•Thesis defenses may be announced to the community electronically as usual. It is common that a portion of thesis defenses are open to the campus community. The student and committee mayMarch 20, 2020
consider sharing a recording of the public portion, and/or others may be invited to join the public portion of the Zoom session. Invitees should disable their video to conserve bandwidth.•If presenting via Zoom or a similar platform is prohibitively difficult, committee members may consider whether it would be acceptable for the candidate to make a pre-recorded presentation available via Box, YouTube, or a similar platform. Then synchronous interactions could focus on questioning and be done by Zoom, possibly with audio only, or a platform for instant messaging if bandwidth is not enough for audio. OIT offers online workshops for creating videos. Use this link to sign up.•Forms for reporting examination outcomes may be signed electronically. Multiple signatures may be gathered on one form, or if easier, the form may be filled in and then copied to each committee member for them to sign separately. Then the separate forms may be gathered and merged into a single PDF. Forms and other information may be found here:https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/current-students/academic-informationFinally, students and committees should make every effort to conduct examinations remotely rather than postpone them. If a qualifying exam or thesis defense must be postponed, the delay should not factor into assessment of the examination or the student’s progress towards degree. The Graduate Division will make every effort to process forms for advancements and degree clearances in time for the standard deadlines that still apply (see https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/current-students/calendar-and-deadlines). Contact Associate Dean Chris Kello (ckello@ucmerced.edu) if there are any questions about policy or possible modes of examination.On behalf of all of us in the Graduate Division, please do all you can to stay healthy and safe.

Merced,20-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Shutdown of All On-Campus Research
March 20, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
Yesterday, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CA Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay at home order for all residents. Through consultation with Deans, faculty, and leaders across campus, we have determined that:
 
All Principal Investigators shall work with their local administrators to begin a campus-wide UC Merced Research Facilities Shutdown. Research must be drawn down as soon and as safely as possible, and a plan enacted for on-campus research to cease by noon Sunday, March 22, 2020 until further notice. People conducting this shutdown effort for each group should be kept at an absolute minimum between now and noon on Sunday.
 
Under no conditions is laboratory equipment, chemicals, biologics, materisals, etc., be taken off-campus. Laptops and other mobile storage devices can be taken off-campus. All human subjects research requiring face-to-face, in person interaction shall cease immediately.
 
Please use the UC Merced Ramp Down Checklist to assist in your shutdown planning.
 
Expect the shutdown to last several weeks to months. Only remote research, defined as that which can be done remotely and does not require laboratory equipment and supplies, should be performed in this period without further permission.
 
If a Principal Investigator requires ongoing research to take place at a campus site during a shutdown, they will be required to fill out an Essential Research Request form in the InfoReady system. Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments must be submitted via the request form linked below. These requests will be reviewed by the relevant Deans together with the Vice Chancellor for Research and faculty representatives. Expect very few exceptions to be granted. Please note that this permission is only required for those activities which must be conducted on campus (the campus proper or other UC Merced facilities).
 
Essential Research Request Form
 
Details on Essential Research: Essential research functions are any functions that are necessary to maintain baseline research or scholarly operations and projects (e.g. vivarium management, clean room management, etc.), that if not continued will result in irreparable damage to instruments, samples or research programs. Any disruption to an “essential research function” could jeopardize the completion of sponsored projects (even if delayed), the reputation of faculty and the institution with sponsors, the prospects of future funding, and even the research capability itself housed at the institution.
 
We note that there are other important creative research programs on campus (music, dance, practice rooms, etc.) that will also need to be stopped on campus.
 
Note that students and trainees (including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel. The decision to report to campus lies with the student worker. Consenting to serve in this capacity will require the signature of the graduate student or postdoc as well as the signature of a third-party individual (a School Dean or their designee). Please use our Essential Research
Trainee Certification form as a template.
 
No personnel should “rush” to campus or campus locations prior to March 22 to complete work. All efforts in the next days should be focused on shutting on-campus research down and transition to off-site research where possible.
 
Mitigating Impact On Our Researchers: The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior researchers. While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship. The Office of Research is working remote but fully operational and continuously updating its COVID19 website with agency guidance regarding research funding.
 
This is a difficult time for all of us and we do not take the cessation of research on campus lightly. Your sacrifices will help save lives. This is one of the most challenging times in modern history. Together, we can make a difference. We know the facts. We have a responsibility to take the lead.

March 20, 2020
Dear Faculty,
 
We are writing to update the campus community on the status of research computing operations and services at UC Merced with regard to Vice Chancellor Samuel Traina’s recent announcement that all on-campus research will cease by noon on Sunday, March 22. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as our operations continue to adjust in response to on-going recommendations and requirements. We are hopeful that some degree of cyberinfrastructure can be maintained and supported to provide research computing capacity for campus researchers.
 
To this end, the Cyberinfrastructure & Research Technologies (CIRT) office has established a set of continuity plans for the research computing enterprise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our campus community. Consistent with other campus continuity plans, continuity of CIRT at UC Merced is anchored in the following two principles: (1) personal safety for the entire campus community; and (2) ensuring ongoing technical support of research operations to the extent possible.
 
CIRT status updates will be posted online and on the MERCED Cluster GitHub user wiki.
 
Below, we list CIRT assets/services with current and anticipated levels of availability during the time campus is impacted by COVID-19. As always, we encourage use of the Service Now system to request CIRT services (including account requests). The CIRT team will endeavor to respond to such requests in a timely manner, though delays may arise due to the current situation.
 
MERCED Cluster
 
The MERCED Cluster was taken offline late last week to undergo maintenance and to be moved to the new Computational Research Facility (Borg Cube), a state-of-the-art data facility built in Project 2020 in support of campus high-performance computing. The cluster move has been somewhat affected by COVID-19 emergency measures, though we remain hopeful that cluster access will be available by Wednesday, March 25. To the extent possible, the CIRT team is committed to keeping the MERCED cluster available for campus researchers to maintain research computing continuity.
 
Maintenance activity on long term storage assets has been impacted by the recent campus operational changes. At present, those resources are unavailable. Access to long term storage servers will be limited for an indefinite time.
 
WAVE Lab
 
The WAVE Lab is closed. WAVE Lab operations will remain suspended until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume.
 
Research Computing In-Person Consultation Is Moving Online
 
The CIRT team has been holding weekly office hours on Fridays as well as providing in-person consultation by appointment. The weekly office hours have been canceled for this week and during spring break. CIRT expects to use a webinar format for weekly drop-in research computing office hours starting Friday, April 3, 2020 through such time as campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume. More information about research computing drop-in office hours will be shared with the campus community the week of March 30 via the Research Computing website and the MERCED Cluster GitHub user wiki.
 
PI and Lab Hardware/Software Deployment Support
 
The CIRT team is committed to continuing some level of support for hardware and software support for individual research groups. However, faculty and other members of the campus research community should anticipate delays in such support. In-person consultations and on-site physical support will be suspended until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume. We also note that many hardware and software vendors are also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in additional service delays and limitations beyond our control.
 
MERCED Node and Other Hardware/Software Purchase Planning
 
The CIRT team is committed to continue some level of support for MERCED node purchasing and purchase planning for grant proposals, start-up budget planning for faculty candidates, and the like. Additionally, CIRT will coordinate with campus procurement to determine feasibility of node and other hardware/software purchases supporting research computing efforts on a case-by-case basis accounting for research project impact, fund source, budget closing dates, and other similar factors. Note that meetings for such planning will be available only by phone and videoconference; CIRT will not provide in-person consultations until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume.
Sincerely,

Merced,20-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Weekly Briefing from the Chancellor
March 23, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered Californians to stay at home indefinitely as health care providers and public officials work to minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Educational institutions like UC Merced are subject to this order, but it is important to note that our campus remains operational. Many functions will be performed remotely, including instruction, which is being delivered as our students continue to make progress toward their degrees. For the few students who remain on campus, we will continue to provide essential services.
We understand that each new announcement from university leadership about the coronavirus creates challenges and anxieties. And now our community is called upon to comply with new guidance, the implications of which we are still exploring with state officials. We appreciate your patience as we navigate these unfamiliar waters together.
We have notified you that two students who reported symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results while under self-quarantine, one on campus and one in a private home. We have no new information on either case at this time, but we will share any updates as we receive them.
We also want to call attention to the unparalleled cooperation and coordination of local, state and federal officials. Congressman Jim Costa has kept us updated on the latest federal thinking and plans. We are grateful to Assembly Member Adam Gray, Merced County and City of Merced officials, and the Merced County Department of Public Health in particular for their advice and assistance.
During this time, campus will operate similar to winter break — only a few core services will be operating, and very few students will be in residence.
Below is a summary of operations we have determined to be essential:
Academic instruction (now offered remotely).
Student housing and dining services, which will continue for a small number of students who remain on campus.
Student health services.
Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels.
Approved research activities.
Emergency response, such as police and environmental health and safety.
IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning.
Human resources, finance and the Employee Assistance Program for employees.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for students, via telehealth. Students can contact CAPS 24/7 at (209) 228-4266 for assistance.
This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential services and employees designated to be on campus will be distributed by supervisors.
In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, here is a running list of communications to faculty, students and staff. All of these, as well as FAQs updated daily and critical resources, are available at emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus.
Some important points to remember:
Essential activity, including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence, is permitted by the governor’s order. Travel abroad is prohibited.
Students may remain in housing only if necessary.
Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave or have been asked to work remotely. Employees with questions and concerns can always contact your supervisor, Human Resources, or the University Ombuds Office.
Do not come to campus to conduct research unless specifically approved.
Events, including commencement, have been cancelled or postponed, and meetings should be limited or conducted in a safe manner.
We are proud of the way everyone at UC Merced — students, faculty and staff — has stepped up during our response to this global crisis: with safety and wellness at the fore, with energy and passion, with thoughtfulness and deliberation. Thank you for all you have done and all you do to prove yet again that this university truly is the great institution, and great community, we have always aspired to be.
We want to assure every member of our community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on our COVID-19 information page.
Sincerely,
Nathan Brostrom

Merced,23-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Guidance for Academic Appointees and Supervisors
March 23, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
As we do our best to work through the COVID-19 crisis, we write to offer guidance on several matters that affect faculty (and other academic appointees). We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through the various areas of concern.
 
Paid Administrative Leave
 
Effective March 1, 2020, President Napolitano issued an executive order that authorized up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave for academic appointees. Paid administrative leave may be granted if at least one of the following conditions are met:
 
unable to work because of your own health issues related to COVID-19 or those of a family member;
unable to work because you have been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID-19-related remote work program or is under a shelter-in-place order and it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely; or
unable to work because a COVID-19 related school or daycare closure demands that you to be home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
 
All academic appointees — policy-covered and represented (including students) — are eligible for COVID-19 related leave if one of these criteria apply. Please note, however, that paid administrative leave must not adversely affect the delivery of instruction or other essential university services. Please see the attachment for general provisions of these guidelines .
 
Academic employees who are requesting paid administrative leave must have prior approval from their supervisor.
 
Completing Timesheets
 
Monthly paid employees will continue to report leave time — sick, vacation, etc. — in the Time Reporting System (TRS) , including applicable use of authorized paid administrative leave. Employees will use the provided code of “Paid Leave (COVID19)” in full-day increments when applicable.
 
Monthly paid (academic) student employees who do not report time via TRS should work with APO ( academicpersonnel@ucmerced.edu ) for information related to COVID-19 impacts.
 
Processing of Merit and Promotion Cases
 
As mentioned in an earlier memo to department chairs, cases for faculty (and other academic employees) in progress with a July 1, 2020, effective date will continue to be processed. Every effort will be made to have all cases decided before the end of June.
 
Recruitments and New Appointments
 
As already noted in a memo to search committee chairs last week, departments should continue to conduct searches for open positions through online means. Appointment cases will continue to be processed.
 
Longer-Term Impacts on Faculty and Other Academic Employees
 
As with all advancement cases, review committees, department chairs, and deans should provide detailed information about the current context and reduced activity in research, challenges in teaching, service contributions, etc., as needed. Faculty should not be penalized for a reduction in work activities during the COVID-19 crisis and are encouraged to write self-statements that mention that work was affected.
 
Sincerely,

Merced,25-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Copyright of Instructional Materials
March 25, 2020
To: All Faculty
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
Many faculty have asked how the rules governing faculty copyright to their instructional materials apply in these extraordinary circumstances.
 
The basic principle of university policy is that instructional faculty own copyright in their instructional materials, unless the university has made exceptional resource commitments to the development of those materials. Given the nature of this COVID-19 crisis, faculty are wondering if the definition of “exceptional university resources” applies now.
 
Simply, it does not. While we are in exceptional circumstances, all faculty are equally impacted. We are therefore classifying the resources provided to develop your course materials as customary and not exceptional.
 
I hope this alleviates any concerns you might have.
 
Best,
Gregg Camfield

Merced,26-Mar-2020,"Performance Appraisal Deadlines Extended
March 26, 2020
March 26, 2020
To: All Administrative Staff
 
Colleagues,
 
As we adjust to the changing work environments and stay at home orders brought on by the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, we want to remind you the performance appraisal process is continuing.
 
In consideration of the changes to our operations, though, we have revised the performance appraisal timeline. The time allowed for employees to complete and submit their Summary of Accomplishments (SOA) has been extended to April 13. Additionally, supervisors’ deadline to submit staff appraisals has been extended to April 30.





Please note that after 15 minutes of inactivity, the Saba system (formerly Halogen) will time out. The system allows revisions to the form, however changes made after the timeout period are NOT saved. Please make sure to save your work regularly.
 
Supervisors
 
Completion dates for each step of the approval process have been revised. Please refer to the 2019-2020 Performance Appraisal Timeline for full details.
 
Beginning March 30, supervisors may access the performance appraisal form in Saba to begin completing the 2019-20 evaluation for their direct reports. Supervisors are expected to submit appraisals to Human Resources by April 30. Please plan accordingly to complete evaluations for your entire team by the deadline, being mindful that remote access and increased system usage (e.g. VPN, Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.) may require more planning, or it may take more time to schedule meetings.
 
To recap this year’s appraisal process:
 
The appraisal period covers April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020.
A narrative is required for appraisals with an overall rating of Met Some Expectations or Met Few Expectations. It is best practice to provide substantive feedback regardless of rating.
An HR review is required for appraisals rated Met Some Expectations or Met Few Expectations. The system will bypass HR steps for those rated Successfully Met Expectations and Far Exceeds Expectations.
HR will review performance appraisals prior to second-level review.
 
For a comprehensive overview of this year’s performance appraisal process, please refer to the 2019-2020 Performance Appraisal process . For a full schedule of online support workshops, go to the University of California Learning Center (UCLC) and register for a session.

To: All Campus
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced we stand with the rest of the country as we work to adapt to our current reality — curtailment of travel, empty classrooms and campuses, canceled and postponed events, economic upheaval, personal challenges of remote learning and work, and reimagining of how to deliver the great education for which the University of California is internationally famous.
 
On behalf of my colleagues, I want to express our profound gratitude to the students, the staff, the faculty and the entire UC Merced community for the resilience, the creativity and the commitment to the campus and to each other that has emanated these past few weeks. These are difficult times for all of us, indeed for the entire world, yet I am impressed and grateful for the goodwill and empathy that Bobcats have shown one another.
 
I also want you to know that I share in your concerns and anxieties about the future. Yet I am also extremely grateful and hopeful for our future, because I know our campus has pulled together so purposefully to address this crisis — and our community is strong, proud and resilient.
 
Our faculty are preparing to resume classes using a variety of technologies. Most students have chosen to remain off campus, and we encourage those returning from spring break to consider that they might be safer and more comfortable learning from home through the rest of the semester.
 
For those few whose circumstances force them to remain on campus, please know that we will continue to provide food, cleaning, health and counseling services and full access to the tools you need to succeed in classes.
 
At UC Merced, we are doing all we can to prepare for what has been happening across the country, while also partnering with city and county officials on a plan to shelter first responders in the event of a local outbreak.
 
The two students on our campus who had reported symptoms of illness and self-quarantined last week have both tested negative for COVID-19. That is good news for them, their families and their friends.
 
But we are not shielded from the spread of this virus. We learned today a campus consultant tested positive, and county officials have reached out to all those with whom this person interacted; no one has reported symptoms, but all were asked to self-quarantine. And Merced County has now reported seven positive tests .
 
Parents and students with questions or concerns can always email specific departments , or attend one of Vice Chancellor Charles Nies’ virtual office hours . I will also be scheduling virtual office hours, and will announce details in the coming days.
 
In the past week, we have communicated to campus about:
 
Guidance for academic appointees and staff.
 
A limited number of our facilities remaining open , including some residence halls. Most have been closed to all but designated personnel.
 
Relaxed policy on copyright ownership of instructional materials.
 
Extended deadlines for staff performance appraisals.
 
Some of our faculty have been sharing useful insights in area media during this crisis:
 
Professor Greg Wright on our economic future .
 
Professor Jennifer Howell on coping with social distance.
 
Professor Martin Haggar on maintaining social support systems.
 
The university will be reaching out to faculty, staff and students early next week as the semester starts up again to offer some specific resources to help us all get through to May and beyond.
 
I look forward to seeing you again face to face on our beautiful campus. In the meantime, please put your health and that of your loved ones first, and remember that even when apart, we are always a strong community.

Merced,29-Mar-2020,"Welcome Back
March 29, 2020
To: Faculty, staff, students, parents and families
March 29, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
On Monday morning our students resume their studies after Spring Break, as they have for 15 years at UC Merced. And yet almost everything will be different.
 
Everyone is facing unprecedented challenges in our school, work and personal lives. The strength of cross-disciplinary education that the University of California provides will be even more important as we navigate a world that is changing, in some ways permanently.
 
Innovative production and delivery of food and medical supplies, design of new facilities and creation of the next wave of complex communication systems will require nimble engineers and bold business leaders with a strong understanding of history, psychology and ethics. Medicine of the future will depend on the genetic, biochemical and epidemiological research of today. The political scientists we educate today will help determine how governments learn from this crisis and respond to our next great challenge, and those in the humanities, social sciences and arts will help us understand and process human behavior and the impact it has on future generations.
 
There will be struggles and missteps. It is the first time many of our students and faculty have had to learn and teach in a 100 percent remote environment, the first time some of our staff have ever worked remotely, and the first time our researchers have been challenged to continue their efforts without access to their research facilities. We will need to be patient with one another and with ourselves. But I firmly believe, as the author William Faulkner opined years ago, that humankind will not merely endure, but prevail.
 
At UC Merced, I am proud and grateful to see our campus community pull together, forging ahead with conviction and passion. Our academic community is creating new knowledge and understanding of our world through continued research efforts. Our dedicated on-campus staff continue to provide food and clean spaces for those students who remain in residence, and a solid infrastructure to allow faculty and students to focus on remote teaching and learning. And the grit, resilience and persistence of our students will be more evident in the days and weeks ahead than at any other time before.
 
Remember you can find our communications and resources gathered at our COVID-19 Emergency Management site . If you have the ability and means to do so, please consider donating blood , and aiding our Student Emergency Fund to continue our ability to support student success.
 
And above all, keep yourselves and your families safe.

Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has made several updates to its services in response to the latest information regarding COVID-19. The changes are designed to be responsive to the needs and concerns of our campus community:
 
CatTracks and Route UC service levels will be significantly reduced beginning today, Monday, March 30. Heritage Express weekend service, the E1 Line and Route UC will operate abbreviated schedules with a focus on providing riders access to essential services. For detailed schedules, please visit the TAPS website .
 
TAPS will suspend on-campus paid parking policies and payroll deductions effective April 1. Customers will see payroll deductions on their April paychecks for March parking services. Faculty and staff who need to be on campus can park in the designated lots best suited to their business needs.
 
Student parking is allowed in the Bellevue Lot. TAPS parking enforcement will be active and will enforce reserved parking space rules, as well as state laws regarding accessible parking, fire lanes and other regulations.
 
TAPS anticipates resuming enforcement for paid parking when California’s stay at home order is lifted and faculty, staff and students begin returning to campus in larger numbers. Parking permit enforcement may resume as soon as June 1. TAPS will inform the campus community at least 48 hours before enforcement resumes.
 
TAPS is in the process of issuing credits to those students who purchased parking for the spring semester valid through May 15. Parking credits will be issued to student accounts along with housing and dining credits.
 
The TAPS office is closed except for designated employees. Please email TAPS or call 209-228-8277 with questions regarding transportation and parking services.

Merced,30-Mar-2020,"Campus Support for Producing Remote Teaching Material
March 30, 2020
To: All faculty and TAs
March 30, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
Today we move forward with instruction in alternative ways many have not explored or experienced before. There are many challenges in doing so. With this in mind — and consideration that instructional spaces including general assignment classrooms and instructional labs are locked down until we hear classes and events can begin meeting in-person again — a procedure has been developed to enable and assist instructors with producing remote teaching material.
 
Four classrooms in COB2 (110, 130, 140 and 170) and the instructional labs in SE1 and SE2 have been designated for this purpose. These rooms are not for in-person instruction and additional individuals beyond the instructor are limited to only those directly assisting instructors in the production of instructional content.
 
These designated spaces will be available for reserved use from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday effective Monday, March 30.
 
Please note, instructors will first work with IT classroom support staff and work through existing resources to develop remote teaching material. If classroom or instructional lab access for use of the technology for producing remote teaching material is deemed necessary, IT will facilitate reserving space. Please follow the steps here to initiate the process:
 
Instructor contacts registrar@ucmerced.edu at least one work day in advance;
Registrar’s Office will facilitate coordination between the instructor and IT classroom support staff;
IT will guide instructors through existing resources here: https://it.ucmerced.edu/EdContinuity ;
If access to a campus room is still needed, IT will create a Service Now ticket and set up an appointment (not to exceed four hours) to coordinate access to the designated room and assist in setting up the technology with the instructor;
The Registrar’s Office will create a calendar appointment on Astra schedule and will notify campus units including facilities, custodial, police and emergency response about the room usage;
Custodians will be scheduled to clean the room after each use.
 
This current process can and will be adapted with changing needs. Thanks for your cooperation and patience.
 
Best,

Merced,31-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: Resources for Faculty as Instruction Resumes
March 31, 2020
To: All faculty and TAs
March 31, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As classes resume, we write to thank you for all you have done to quickly shift the campus to remote education. We know this transition is taking place while you address the needs of your own families, friends and communities. We are grateful for your efforts and hope that you remain healthy and secure.
 
Your commitment to our students is clearly reflected in the work that many of you have been undertaking to better understand your students’ circumstances as they seek to complete the semester in this new educational context. Here we share some of what has been learned through course-specific polls and surveys, together with some resources we hope will support you and your students going forward.
 
Student Access to Technology
 
While the campus’s loaner program for laptops and internet access was active in the week before spring break, we are learning that some students may continue to lack the basic technology necessary to successfully complete their courses remotely. To help address this, a message has been placed on the CatCourses landing page encouraging students — both undergraduates and graduates — to report needs for a laptop, webcam and/or reliable internet access. Requests for these items will be addressed through the Loaner Laptop Program as quickly as possible, subject to technology availability. Should you know of students needing these resources, please direct them to the Loaner Laptop Program website .
 
Challenging Personal Circumstances and Student Success
 
Here are a few important situations we need to be cognizant of and proactive about:
 
Student Financial and Personal Obligations
﻿
Campus-based employment may be the only source of income for our undergraduates and their families. They may also be assuming responsibilities to care for their families.
 
What you can do: The campus is working actively to enable job continuity for our student employees. Please be aware of additional financial and mental burdens on students and extend grace and support to these students as they balance academic, financial and personal responsibilities.
 
Student Welfare
 
Students may experience circumstances related to their safety, security and personal well-being.
 
What you can do: Should you become aware of such concerns, please encourage the student to reach out to the Dean of Students or, in the case of graduate students, the graduate support staff in the schools, who can help connect the student to resources and support. Should you notice a student struggling or disengaging from a course, we encourage you to reach out to the student via text, email or other means to check in and provide support. If a student doesn’t respond, or if you have serious concerns about their well-being, you may complete a Student of Concern form ,and a UC Merced staff member will follow up.
 
Ascertaining Student Engagement
 
To identify and assist students who may face circumstances that impact their ability to pursue their coursework, you may find useful existing CatCourses tools that provide course and student-specific student engagement and participation information. A description of these tools and how to use them is available on the Educational Continuity for Faculty website under Strategies and Digital Tools: 13. Monitoring Student Engagement: CatCourses, Kaltura.
 
Most importantly, supporting students with continued flexibility in due dates and asynchronous instructional strategies to enable students to continue their education while addressing these needs is encouraged.
 
Additional Resources
 
Please continue to utilize the Educational Continuity for Faculty website and the Educational Continuity for Students website for tools and resources for continued success in this new learning environment. Resources are continually being updated in response to user questions and needs.
 
Please also review How to protect your Zoom sessions to secure your classes from the emerging problem of uninvited individuals disrupting Zoom meetings.
 
Student Pass/No Pass Option
 
Finally, on March 30, the Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option for their course(s) from letter grade to Pass/No Pass up to the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020 semester.
 
﻿As highlighted in the policy, such a change could have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that you talk with your students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their advisors, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarship before requesting this change.
 
In closing, we wish to recognize the dedication of our staff to facilitating the campus’s transition to remote instruction. We are grateful for all they have done, and will continue to do, as we collectively work to help our students successfully complete the semester and stay on course for their degrees.
 
Thank you, again, and please take appropriate measures to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and healthy — physically and mentally — and be kind to yourself, your colleagues, staff and students.

Dear Campus Community,
 
With overwhelming gratitude, we are proud of how our Bobcat community has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect our students, staff and faculty in the face of this pandemic, as well as to “flatten the curve” for the benefit of all. To create safety through all of this, our students have uprooted themselves while our staff and faculty have worked around the clock.
 
The personal adjustments you have each made have not been easy, and we thank you.
 
We are experiencing a global public health crisis that is affecting our communities and our families in deeply personal and sometimes devastating ways.
 
Unfortunately, crises do not affect everyone equally. Changes that are easy for some are nearly impossible for others, leaving many of our own valued community members feeling vulnerable, frustrated and unsafe.
 
Even as this crisis impacts us in different ways and we navigate unforeseen challenges, we are still a community. As such, it is important that continue to unite as a community grounded in our core values.
 
One of those core values is inclusiveness – valuing each unique member of our campus and greater communities.
 
As we continue to work and connect with each other through technology, we must center that inclusiveness. Dialogue, whether in person or remote, should be a respectful exchange of diverse ideas. We do not have to all agree but we can disagree respectfully.
 
We urge you to show up for each other with kindness, civility and respect in your everyday connections in these unique learning and sharing spaces. Below are some quick tips on how we can continue to do so:
 
Engage in active listening and create space for psychological safety.
Practice gratitude and mindfulness.
Be civil in electronic communications especially email .
 
To help maintain our community, the Offices of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the Ombuds will continue to offer ways for you to connect, including:
 
Monthly CDO Drop-In Hours
Virtual Dialogue Series
Keep Calm and Telecommute On
 
We are commUNITY and we are in this together.

Colleagues,
 
We are facing challenging times, with the health of our students, our families, and our loved ones at the forefront of our minds. Worrying about economic security can only magnify those concerns. To address that very real worry, today I joined President Janet Napolitano and my fellow campus chancellors in pledging that University of California will not lay off any career employees through June 30, 2020.
 
UC Merced’s students, the Central Valley and the future of California depend on each one of you and the distinct roles you play in our campus community. You are all integral to our continued research, our teaching excellence, and the economic impact that our campus has on this community. Please take time to read the full letter , and if you still have questions, please contact your supervisor or write to hr@ucmerced.edu .
 
Take care of yourselves and your loved ones, and remember that we are better together.

April 3, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
UC Merced has completed its first week of fully remote instruction. While faculty and students are navigating this new world together, we remain committed to delivering a world-class University of California education effectively and safely.
We know that online classes across the country have been invaded by outside individuals and groups pressing their agendas of hatred and bigotry. UC Merced stands strongly for inclusion and equity, and our Office of Information Technology is taking concrete steps to block this sort of hatred from interfering with our education by providing instruction and resources on security measures.
You should also be aware that UC President Janet Napolitano, my fellow campus chancellors and I have unanimously agreed not to lay off any career employees for at least the next three months, so staff can continue to focus on their work and their health and not their economic security.
Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with some of our colleagues who are still on campus, providing direct services to students and maintaining critical campus operations. I am amazed at the passion and dedication of all who work at UC Merced, and particularly of these folks who ensure students are fed, systems are operational and campus is safe during this challenging period.
Fresno’s ABC30 joined us for part of that walk around campus.
Our faculty have continued to share their insights with the world. Just a few examples:
Nicotine and Cannabis Policy Center researchers talk about the heightened risk smokers and vapers face during the pandemic.
Professor LeRoy Westerling examines the phenomenon of California city-dwellers fleeing to more remote areas to ride out the crisis.
Professor Ajay Gopinathan discusses the challenges and joys of establishing a new university.
And in a moment guaranteed to lift your spirits, ESPN recognizes senior volleyball player Joey Medina.
Finally, I want to call your attention to a critical national need: blood donations. On April 15 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Italo American Lodge in Merced, the American Red Cross will host a blood drive. I intend to donate blood, and I’d love to see the UC Merced community turn out to help our community.
I look forward to seeing you again face to face on our beautiful campus. In the meantime, please put your health and that of your loved ones first, and remember that even when apart, we are always a strong community.

Dear Campus Community,
 
I am impressed and proud of how our campus community is navigating these challenging times. Though we face many challenges, our resilience and commitment to each other continues to shine. Our office in collaboration with Student Affairs and many others are proud to support our campus community by providing resources and support in a variety of ways. We encourage your participation and active support of each other. Here are a few opportunities to explore:
 
This Week:
Virtual Healing Circle, led by Onar Primitivo, Director of Social Justice Initiatives, will be held at noon Monday, April 6 for any student impacted by Zoom hacking. A flyer with access information was sent to all students last week via Happenings.
PEN America’s Webinar Series ”What Professors Need to Know About Online Hate and Harrasment"" from 1-2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, April 7.
Virtual Dialogue Series hosted by the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion. The first session will be led by Jonathan Grady, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students from 1-2 p.m. April 9 and will address “Radical Healing Through Strategic Conversations for Staff & Faculty.”
 
Ongoing:
Monthly drop-in hours for faculty and staff, hosted by Dania Matos, Associate Chancellor and Chief Diversity Officer.
Weekly office hours for students, hosted by Charles Nies, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.
The Office of Information Technology in partnership with the Chief Diversity Officer is arranging the distribution of the app Calm for all faculty, staff, and students. Calm is the No. 1 app for Sleep, Meditation and Relaxation and has been named by the Center for Humane Technology as ""the world's happiest app."" We thank Interim Chancellor Nathan Brostrom and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Gregg Camfield for their generous support of this project. Look for more details coming soon.
 
Additionally, campus safety is a top priority for leadership. Zoom — which as become the platform we utilize to connect for classes, meetings, celebration and so much more — has fallen prey to uninvited individuals who threaten to disrupt these spaces through trolling, racism and vulgar content.
 
We are aware, tracking and taking action against this emerging phenomenon. We actively denounce these heinous acts, as they stand against who we are. We recognize the impact to those who have experienced them and are providing support and resources.
 
Every day, but even more so during this time, we are striving to promote safe, affirming and inclusive communities for all of our staff, students and faculty to thrive in their learning, working and researching, grounded in our Principles of Community.
 
Harassment, belittling, and attacks against any member of our community will not be tolerated. We want to take a moment to share campus support and resources that are available.
 
How to Protect Your Zoom Sessions, available from the Office of Information Technology.
Connect with resources designed to support you if you are impacted by these acts. For students, our Counseling and Psychological Services Office is aware and prepared to provide support via telehealth. For faculty and staff, our employee assistance program is available
Incident reporting is being developed to help monitor this activity. While it is usually external hackers who are trolling for links to these Zoom meetings around the world, if the university finds that a member of our community is involved in these acts, appropriate consequences would result.
 
Thank you for your help as we work diligently to prevent these intolerable acts from occurring.
 
We will continue to provide support and resources and keep you informed as they become available.

Consistent with the University of California’s mission of teaching, research and public service, we also seek opportunities to help our community. One such opportunity — made even more important by the current crisis — presents itself in Merced next week.

Assembly Member Gray and I have signed up to donate. If you are able to join us, you can register here , or find another drive closer to home.
 
I ask everyone at UC Merced who can safely do so to join me in donating blood. So many people are facing dire medical needs that require blood or plasma, and in this way we can do something incredibly positive during a crisis that has limited much of what we are usually able to accomplish.

﻿Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced we are working to address the current crisis, keep our students, faculty and staff safe, and provide the resources for educational continuity and success. We must also plan for the growth and sustainability of this university.
 
Our plans prioritize the people who make UC Merced great and contribute to the intellectual, civic, cultural and economic richness of the San Joaquin Valley — hence my enthusiasm for joining President Napolitano and my fellow chancellors in announcing we will lay off no career staff through this fiscal year.
 
What we do not yet know is the full scale and ultimate implication, at a state, national or global level, of the COVID-19 pandemic, so we must continue to be as fiscally prudent as possible while advancing our mission.
 
The Division of Finance and Administration will share specific guidelines about spending and personnel practices as we move forward. These will require us to make thoughtful decisions about university priorities. As you may know, every hiring decision is already scrutinized by our Position Delegates Council, under the guidance of divisional and school leadership; their criteria will now include a sharper focus on those positions essential to the university’s core goals.
 
But UC Merced has, from its founding, learned to create excellence with lean resources, and has over the years implemented a number of processes and policies that will, in our current challenge, stand us in greater stead than better resourced and less disciplined institutions.
 
I ask for your patience as we work through and communicate all the details about next steps. We will always continue to prioritize faculty, staff and students, their well-being, and the future of the university — because we know we are better together, and we are #BobcatProud.

April 10, 2020
To: Faculty, staff, students and parents
April 10, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
We are closing on a month since we moved education and most services at UC Merced to remote delivery because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While across the United States we are starting to see signs of hope, in Merced the effects of the virus are now starting to be felt more acutely.
 
As of Thursday, April 9, Merced County had 52 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , and it is unfortunate to note that one of the newest cases is a member of our campus community. The person has not been on campus since before spring break, and is now recovering at home in a private residence in Merced. Given the rapid progress of this crisis, the university will limit announcements to cases that present a significant change in circumstances or have broad impact on our community.
 
You should take note of the county’s latest directives , which include a clarification and strengthening of the requirement to stay at home, except for essential travel (educational institutions are categorized as essential); guidance to avoid gatherings; and a closing of public outdoor parks and recreational facilities (such as Lake Yosemite), though individual outdoor activity remains permitted, with appropriate distancing. The university has closed recreational facilities except for walking trails.
 
The county is also strongly encouraging the use of face covering for any interactions. We cannot agree strongly enough with this practice. On campus, our Emergency Operations Center will be distributing face covers to designated employees and students still in residence, starting Tuesday, April 14, in COB1.
 
We remain in discussion with the city and county about providing shelter to first responders in empty residence halls, should the course of the pandemic accelerate sharply in Merced. And I’d like to remind all from our community who have the ability to join me in donating blood on Wednesday, April 15, at the Italo-American Lodge in Merced.
 
Also, the University of California will be reaching out to those with UC-held student loans that are currently in repayment (such as Dream Loans, institutional loans and Perkins loans), announcing temporary measures such as a halt to interest accrual, collections actions, and late fees. This is another way the university is acknowledging the very real economic hardship felt by so many in our broad community.
 
Our amazing faculty continue to perform a great service by sharing their expertise with the general public. Some recent examples include:
 
An op-ed by Professors Nancy Burke and Irene Yen and Medical Education Director Thelma Hurd about COVID-19 revealing health disparities in the Valley .
Scientific American’s highlighting of Professor Anna Song’s research on the connection between smoking and COVID-19 susceptibility .
Professor Robin DeLugan’s thinking on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant farm workers .
Interviews by Univision and Radio Bilingue with Professor Marcos Garcia-Ojeda about curbing the spread of COVID-19.
CalMatters’ story on economic impacts of the virus , featuring commentary by Professor Ketki Sheth.
Deputy University Librarian Donald Barclay explaining the real danger of fake news in a time of crisis.
 
Finally, I want to remind everyone that there is news apart from COVID-19. Ten of our graduate students have advanced to the finals of our annual Grad Slam competition, and we are excited to see the final round on May 8. And the U.S. census continues its very important work, to which everyone should respond and be counted .
 
Please remember to take care of yourselves and your loved ones, and that even apart, we are better together.

Merced,10-Apr-2020,"COVID-19: Position Control and Fiscal Responsibility Guidelines
April 9, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Earlier today, Chancellor Nathan Brostrom wrote about the need for fiscal prudence as UC Merced plans to grow and thrive. In consultation with the UC Office of the President, we are evaluating various models to plan for potential financial impacts and help guide future decision making as we navigate the unknown future. In this process, we are implementing several proactive actions to protect jobs and continue the university’s mission.
Beginning today, April 9, 2020, every unit should undertake all possible cost-saving measures to sustain our campus priorities, including:
Carefully monitor expenses in final months of this fiscal year and delay any expenditures greater than $5,000 until our budget picture becomes clearer. Major expenditures should be approved by your manager/supervisor or department/division head. (Note: Contract and grant related purchases where reimbursement is assured should continue to move forward.)
Review your budget allocation and identify opportunities for immediate and long-term savings.
Refrain from submitting new requests to Human Resources for reclassifications, equity adjustments, stipends, contract and limited-term positions unless they are critical to the operation of the campus or to protecting the safety and well-being of the campus community, or will protect against significant compliance/legal risk.
Hiring and onboarding continues, but we are tightening our longtime position control process. Our Position Delegates Council will scrutinize each new position, under the guidance of divisional and school leadership; their criteria will now include a much sharper focus on those positions critical to accomplishing the university’s goals.
All new staff and academic recruitment will be paused except for:
Positions critical to the health and safety of the campus community and campus assets, such as public safety, health center and custodial staff.
Positions required to support the quality of remote instruction, student success during the crisis, and changes in research modalities that can be integrated into best practices after the crisis passes.
Positions nearing conclusion in their searches or for which offers have been extended, and remote work is possible.
Positions for which deferral would result in greater fiscal costs to the unit and campus, or reductions to or forgoing of revenue streams, or pose significant compliance/legal risk.
In addition, requests for new compensation review based on classification, reclassification and stipends should be paused. Requests for new and back-fill permanent positions, new contract positions and new limited-term positions will require approval from a dean or division leader and be reviewed against the above criteria. Finally, the STAR awards program will be temporarily suspended and compensation decisions traditionally associated with the performance appraisal process will be temporarily delayed until further clarity about the University’s financial situation is known.
Detailed instructions regarding the position management process, including how to submit new recruitments, will be communicated to managers and supervisors as soon as we evaluate current recruitments. This will be re-evaluated every three months.
Further, campus leadership is exploring how some staff can be redeployed across campus to aid in areas where there is an increased workload resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. This will allow employees who might otherwise not be able to work remotely to work on critical projects and engage with others.
Despite these challenges, I am sure we all share the optimism of President Napolitano: “While there may be turbulent financial waters ahead for the university, I know that through thoughtful and careful planning we will get through them together.”

Merced,13-Apr-2020,"Spring 2020 Grading
April 13, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
The global pandemic during the spring of 2020 is extraordinary with wide recognition that it has disrupted lives in countless ways. The Federal stimulus package passed in the United States stipulates that institutions extend flexibility to their student population during the crisis. On March 30, the UC Merced Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option for their course(s) from letter grade to Pass/No Pass up to the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020 semester.
These guidelines are meant for undergraduates, academic advisors, and faculty to inform guidance on a P / NP grade choice. Academic advisors are an important resource for consultation. Please visit the Registrar website for information on grade options.
Changing the grading option to Pass/No Pass provides flexibility and could also have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that you talk with your students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their instructors, academic advisors, and their degree program(s) before requesting this change. The following are important considerations to guide decision-making:
For the Spring 2020 semester only, ALL UC Merced undergraduate programs have agreed to accept Pass/No Pass grades. UC Merced degree programs typically require students to utilize the letter grade option for all of their required courses. All undergraduate degree programs have agreed to temporarily waive this requirement only for the Spring 2020 semester.
Students who plan to apply for postgraduate/professional study: Letter Grade requirement. While a vast majority of educational institutions in the US have moved to providing a Spring 2020 Pass/No pass grading option, there is a small chance that Medical/professional/graduate schools may not accept a grading option of P/NP for some courses (referenced as “letter grade” requirement risk in the flowchart below).
Students working on raising their GPA to be in good standing: Students who need to raise their GPA above a 2.0 to be in good standing or for purposes of financial aid may be harmed by the adoption of P/NP grades as they are not included in GPA calculations.
Students who receive veterans benefits: Students who receive Veterans or Veterans dependent benefits should seek guidance from Campus Veteran’s Services: veteranservices@ucmerced.edu
Maintaining satisfactory academic progress for financial aid: In addition to GPA, a student must maintain “Satisfactory Academic Progress” (SAP). As indicated in the Federal Stimulus Package language, students choosing to adopt Pass/No Pass grading option will maintain SAP as Pass/No Pass grades still figure into the SAP calculation. Otherwise, P/NP does not have a financial aid impact.
Important information about the student’s decision
The grade P is assigned for a letter grade of C- or better. If the student earns a grade of D+ or below, the grade will be recorded as NP. In both cases, the student’s grade will not be computed into the grade point average.
Update 5/4/2020: The Senate has recently approved a P/NP grade change option for WRI 001 for Spring and Summer 2020. Original: Students may not change the grade option for WRI 001 to P/NP at this time. In order to satisfy the University of California English Language Writing Requirement (ELWR), students must earn a grade of C or higher in WRI 001 thus eliminating the option of P/NP in this instance.
Process for students interested in changing grading option
Students interested in making a grade option change should consult with an academic advisor on any of the above factors or additional questions and then go to MyRegistration - then Change Grading Option. Students have until Friday, May 8 11:59 pm PST, the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020, to change their grading option. There is a flowchart provided below that may be useful for some members of the UC Merced academic community as they work through grading option choices for our undergraduate student population.

TO: All faculty and TAs
April 14, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
We would like to follow up the April 13 general announcement about Spring 2020 grading and emphasize some relevant points for instructors.
 
The reasons for our current flexibility are multiple, with the two greatest being an acknowledgement that the learning context has radically changed and that these changes have created incredible stresses on both students and faculty. In part to alleviate stress on students, the Senate has given students the option to elect P/NP grading for any of their classes anytime between now and the final day of spring instruction, May 8.
 
On the one hand, there is no change in the grading process and the registrar will provide a reminder and details about grading near the end of the semester. On the other, we do ask that you consider making yourself available to help advise students as to the possible advantages and disadvantages of P/NP grades .
 
Related, we have received requests to provide instructors with additional time to submit final grades this semester and we have therefore worked with the Registrar in extending the grade submission date by one week. The registrar and the provost will send more details about that change later this week.
 
The Registrar’s Office can be a point of contact for any instructors who have questions. This information is also included on the registrar's webpage .

Dear Campus Community,
 
There is no more significant celebration at a university than commencement. Our hearts go out to the members, families and friends of the Class of 2020 for the delay of such an important in-person rite of passage. But we will create events that are memorable — both virtual on graduation day, and in-person at a later date to be announced.
 
The virtual ceremony, on Saturday, May 16, will allow graduates, their loved ones, and our entire campus community to celebrate the Class of 2020 remotely. Information and updates will be sent to graduates via their UC Merced email accounts and at commencement.ucmerced.edu .
 
#UCM2020 Journey
 
UC Merced is committed to commemorating the tremendous and diverse accomplishments of our Graduates by creating the #UCM2020 Journey Project. We invite our students, staff and faculty to submit photos, videos and messages for our graduates , and we will share some of these moments throughout the month of May as we reflect on our achievements and successes as a Bobcat community.
 
Student Speaker/Singer
 
Though our ceremony will be virtual, there will still be opportunities for graduates to participate as a student speaker or student singer. If you are interested in applying for either role, please review the requirements and criteria on the online application . The deadline to apply is Thursday, April 23.
 
Although a virtual commencement may not be the traditional celebration our campus is accustomed to, we look forward to making this experience memorable for our graduates and their families until we are able to come together again.

To: All staff and faculty
April 14, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
UC Systemwide Human Resources has released information that compares federal and UC plans for various leaves available to policy-covered and represented employees, including federal paid leave plans part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act signed into law March 18 by President Donald Trump.
 
There are three COVID-19 related paid administrative leave options: UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave, FFCRA Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL), and Expanded Family and Medical Leave (EFML). The plans differ by time covered, required UC service, and how and for what purposes the leave time can be used.
 
The council also provides extensive questions and answers about the use of paid leave, sick leave, UC-provided health benefits during the COVID-19 crisis and the April 2 announcement regarding no layoffs of career employees related to COVID-19 through the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
 
If you have questions, please contact Human Resources at hr@ucmerced.edu
 
Sincerely,

Merced,16-Apr-2020,"Telework Extension and New Programs to Assist Employees
April 16, 2020
To: All staff and faculty
April 16, 2020
 
Dear UC Merced employees,
 
Human Resources staff continues to review and create programs to support UC Merced employees whose jobs and lives have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please read the information below. There is news for the hundreds of us who are working remotely, along with assistance for qualified child-care expenses and two programs that tap into our desire to help each other.
 
Telework Agreement Extension
 
Temporary telecommuting agreements are being extended through May 31. University employees working remotely who previously submitted a Temporary Telecommute Agreement need to complete a simple amendment form to extend the agreement. The form also asks you to note University property you brought home, such as laptops and phones. A report about the equipment will be sent to supervisors and managers for proper tracking once all employees are able to work at campus locations again safely. Keep in mind the Temporary Telecommute Agreement can be lengthened or shortened based on new information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Qualified Disaster Relief Payment Program
 
The Qualified Disaster Relief Payment Program (QDP) is new for UC Merced employees who are designated and required to work on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic. QDP will pay up to $1,000 for qualified child-care expenses. For more information about the program, contact Human Resources’ Benefits team .
 
 
Catastrophic Leave Donation Bank
 
UC Merced employees now can donate vacation time to other colleagues who have a chronic health condition and have run out of paid leave. The Catastrophic Leave Donation Bank is an addition to the Catastrophic Leave Program, in which you can specify the employee for whom you wish to donate time. Go here for more details.
 
Job Exchange Bank
 
We are pleased to announce a Job Exchange Bank for represented and non-represented UC Merced staff employees. The program is designed to identify underused staff and match them with departments and units that can use their abilities for tasks, assignments or projects. Departments that need staff support can complete this form . Departments that have staff available for redeployment can complete this form .
 
We will continue to keep staff updated as information is available. Stay healthy, safe and connected.

To All Members of the UC Merced Community:
 
UC Merced Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD), CARE, and UC Merced Police recognize that staying at home and experiencing physical isolation can create situations or circumstances which may be harmful for some members of our community, especially those experiencing relationship or family violence. Concerns about virus transmission introduce new approaches that may be used to impose control or manipulate a partner. Similarly, physical distancing restrictions may create additional challenges related to safety, health, privacy and confidentiality. External factors such as economic and health insecurity can add stress and create circumstances that further compromise safety.
 
UC Merced takes reports of sexual and domestic violence or any conduct that falls within the scope of the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy seriously and responds promptly to reports of such conduct. We are committed to continuing to support our students, staff and faculty who are affected by sexual and domestic violence and are quarantined at home with an abuser. All services continue to be available, including assistance with workplace, academic, and housing accommodations consistent with current COVID-19 guidance.
 
Our campus community practices bystander intervention. We encourage those who are able to do so safely to continue practicing bystander intervention, even though it may be more challenging given our remote environment. We can all play the role of active bystanders to stop behaviors or incidents from occurring. Thank you for your partnership in creating a safe and harassment-free community.
 
Finally, sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited by law and by university policy. This includes domestic and relationship violence. All employees, unless they are specifically designated by policy as confidential employees, are Responsible Employees and are required to report such incidents to the Title IX Officer Michael Salvador in the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination. He can be reached at 209-285-9510 or via email.

Merced,17-Apr-2020,"Extension of Spring Grade Submission Date
April 17, 2020
To: All faculty and TAs
April 17, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As referenced in the April 14 message to instructors entitled “ Follow-Up Grading Information ,” the registrar has extended the spring grade submission deadline by one week to noon, Tuesday, May 26. This extension is designed to help ease some of the stress on you, but it has consequences on students and on the Registrar’s Office.
 
Each term the grade submission deadline is established to allow the Registrar's Office time to collect grades and process students’ grade point averages. It is only after all grade point averages are calculated that staff can begin degree conferral, can distribute transcripts, and can determine academic standing and financial aid eligibility. Thus, we encourage you to make reasonable efforts to submit your grades by the original deadline.
 
With deep gratitude for and appreciation of the extraordinary work you have done this semester,

Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced continues to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and plan for several potential futures, depending on the course of this pandemic and the implications of the response at a global, national, state and campus level. While a few members of our campus community have tested positive, so far they are well on their way to recovery. We still have not had any positive cases reported on campus among our designated staff nor the approximately 200 students still in residence whom they continue to serve.
 
Merced County has now recorded 82 COVID-19 cases. What has been driven home this week is the tremendous need in our community caused by the outbreak. A number of us from UC Merced joined Assembly Member Adam Gray and many colleagues on Wednesday in donating blood to the American Red Cross, and on Tuesday some of us joined members of the 1040th Quartermaster Company, California National Guard, and the California Conservation Corps at the Merced County Food Bank in packing food for those struggling to keep their families fed in our area. Both of these great community-based organizations say needs will rise as economic conditions remain unsettled for the foreseeable future. I hope, if you are well and able, you can continue to find ways to support your neighbors while we all work through these times together.
 
This week, we have communicated to our community about grading changes and resources for employees , particularly around personal safety while working remotely and leave options . Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and Chief of Staff Luanna Putney shared an inspirational message with campus, and more messages from campus leaders will arrive over coming days and weeks.
 
Perhaps most importantly, student leaders joined me in announcing plans for a virtual commencement ceremony on May 16, with an in-person ceremony in the future; please encourage all graduating students to submit photos, videos and messages to share at the ceremony.
 
Our faculty continue to share their research, insights and knowledge with the public, including:
 
Smoking may put people at greater COVID-19 risk , researchers say
 
Warning signs for fake coronavirus articles , experts weigh in
 
Extreme wildfires are changing Western forests
 
Pandemic And Wildfire: California Is Preparing For A Crisis Within A Crisis
 
Finally, take a moment to read this great story about Dr. Van Do-Reynoso , one of our Ph.D. graduates in public health services and systems research, who is earning kudos as director of public health for Santa Barbara County. Her life has been an amazing journey, her work is critical to the health of hundreds of thousands of Californians, and her story illustrates so well why we do what we do at UC Merced.
 
Please remember to take care of yourselves and your loved ones, and that even apart, we are better together.

Merced,22-Apr-2020,"Performance Reviews Delayed for Unrepresented Staff
April 22, 2020
To: All Staff
April 22, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
UC President Janet Napolitano has communicated that, in light of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, current deadlines for completing written performance evaluations are suspended until Fall 2020. This guidance applies only to unrepresented staff. It is expected that represented staff will continue their performance review process per the original campus guidelines, consistent with expectations of collective bargaining agreements.
 
Performance management is a year-round responsibility. Supervisors are always encouraged to meet regularly with employees to review goals, achievements and progress. Because performance appraisals are a critical tool for feedback and professional development, we encourage supervisors to continue helping employees establish and prioritize goals for the upcoming year, especially during this time of uncertainty that is causing many employees to worry about their future work.
 
We also encourage you to use this time, if you’re able, to hone your skills in delivery of remote performance management. Useful tools for this can be found here .
 
We recognize that now more than ever, it is important for managers and supervisors to check in regularly with their employees, to talk not only about professional responsibilities, goals and development opportunities, but also about well-being and providing support and resources .
 
Many employees and their supervisors have begun or completed their summaries of accomplishment and appraisals. We applaud your commitment to this process.
 
President Napolitano also indicated that decisions concerning the merit pay program for policy-covered staff also is postponed until later this year when more information about the UC system’s financial situation is available.
 
When more guidance from the Office of the President is provided, we will share it. I appreciate the continued commitment of our managers, supervisors and staff to develop skills, assets and abilities that help our campus meet its mission. You are our most essential asset.
 
Stay safe and well.

Dear Campus Community,
 
The work of UC Merced continues, in person and remotely, and I want to both thank you all again for the great effort you have put in to continue our mission and remind you that what we are doing now is not “the new normal.” We are exploring every day how and when it will be possible to safely restore operations for students, faculty and staff to fully experience a University of California education and culture.
 
As Gov. Newsom reminds us, what we must decide on is not a date, but a set of indicators. The work of the institution is important, but more important is the well-being of all of us in the UC Merced community. This means that the most important traits we can model are patience and hope. COVID-19 has not been easy for any of us, and a good part of the difficulty has been not knowing for certain when things will improve. So I thank you again for the patience that I myself have struggled with — moving quickly or arbitrarily is not a responsible path.
 
As of April 24, Merced County has reported 102 positive COVID-19 cases, half of whom have recovered. We have heard of no positive tests within the UC Merced community in several weeks, and those few of whom we were aware are on the mend.
 
In the past week, we have discussed changes to the employee performance review process for this year , and I hope you had the chance to read about the tremendous work of your colleagues in the spring edition of Inside UC Merced ; I call your attention particularly to the opportunities it offers for volunteering to help your community. I hope as well that you have enjoyed the new Interactive Virtual Campus Tour that highlights new and older facilities, faculty research and special benefactors of UC Merced; this is a wonderful resource for so many of us to share with potential students and colleagues as well as all those who want to learn more about the university.
 
I’d like to remind you once more of the virtual commencement ceremony on May 16, and encourage you to ask all graduating students to submit photos, videos and messages to share at the ceremony.

Finally, today is Bobcat Day — the time when so many admitted students and their families come to campus each year to learn more about UC Merced and the amazing education that awaits them. This year, it is a virtual celebration, and already 1,000 people have registered to join online for a special day being put together by the hardworking teams in the Division of Student Affairs.

Re: Make Our Graduates Smile
To: All faculty and staff
April 28, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
We are all sorry to not be holding an in-person graduation ceremony for the hardworking class of 2020, but here is a way that faculty and staff can help make our virtual commencement memorable for our students. We know that nothing will make our graduates smile more than seeing your faces, the faces of the faculty and staff who have taught and nurtured them along their journey.
 
As such, we are planning to have the traditional processional of Elgar’s “ Pomp and Circumstance ” be sung (not well, but passionately) by all of us. Over the next three days, there will be a series of quick Zoom recording sessions, coordinated by faculty member Katie Brokaw. We would very much appreciate you logging into one of them to wordlessly (DUH, duh-duh-duh, Duh, Duuh) sing along to a recording of the song. The recordings of these Zoom sessions will then be spliced together for the ceremony.
 
Zoom sessions for Project Pomp will be held at the following times (you will be receiving invites to all of them and can attend whatever fits your schedule):
 
Wednesday, April 29 | 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Thursday, April 30 | 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Friday, May 1 | 10 a.m.
 
Guidelines on how this will work:
 
All you need to do is sing along; one orchestral recording will be playing in the background for you during the session, so that all are singing in the same key. Much of the recording will be overdubbed, so please don’t worry if you feel you aren’t a good singer!
Feel free to wear your Master’s or Doctoral robes if you have them, or a UC Merced shirt or lab coat, and to use a UC Merced virtual background . Kids and pets are also welcome! And if you’d like to hold up a congratulations sign or in any other way get creative, go for it!
After we record the song, faculty and staff signed into each session will also have the chance to stay on the call to record a personalized few seconds of video for the Class of 2020, verbally expressing congratulations.
Recording sessions will take between 10-30 minutes, depending on how much you’d like to record.
 
What makes UC Merced special is YOU. If you are able, please try to join one of these short calls over the next few days. It will mean the world to our deserving students, and might just cheer you up a bit, too.
 
Best,

Merced,29-Apr-2020,"Fall 2020 Tuition and Fees
April 29, 2020
Re: Fall 2020 Tuition and Fees
To: All students, faculty and staff
April 29, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced, we are working to make critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation — as is every university around the world. We have a website devoted to providing students with information about our response plans for COVID-19 that we update whenever new decisions or guidance become available, but we want to share the current state of our planning for Fall 2020:
 
Delivery of Instruction Decisions for Fall 2020
 
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with state and county public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. We are planning different scenarios, as we look to health experts and the data to help inform our decisions, and the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.
 
Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instruction. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so.
 
We are making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe public health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing.
 
Decisions about broadly offering Pass/ No Pass (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation will be like in the fall.
 
Tuition and Student Fees for Fall 2020
 
Tuition and mandatory fees for Academic Year 20-21 have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.
 
Campus-based fees support campus services, maintain facilities, and broadly support and preserve the campus infrastructure. As campus operations adjust to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated team of professionals remains committed to delivering the highest quality service possible. Campus-based fees will still be collected to support those efforts.
 
Student Housing for Fall 2020
 
Under normal operations, all incoming first-year students are required to live on campus for their first two academic years. It is not possible to know now whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in changes to operations in student housing and residence education in Academic Year 2020-2021.
 
Consequently, we may not be able to meet all of the requests for on-campus housing that would allow students to fulfill UC Merced’s two-year residency requirement.
 
We will keep our residence halls open unless we are required by public health authorities to close. If students choose to live in campus housing and conditions affecting in-person instruction change either prior to the start of the semester or during the semester, we will allow students the opportunity to seek a full or pro-rated refund of housing and dining costs.
 
Students in off-campus housing should pay close attention to the terms of their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Students should consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease for more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Students can learn more about off-campus housing services at https://och.ucmerced.edu/ and can seek advice through the UC Merced Law Clinic before signing leases.
 
We thank everyone for their understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform our community of the latest developments as we plan for the coming fall.

Merced,4-May-2020,"Guidance for Summer Session Grading
May 4, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The 2020 global pandemic is extraordinary, with wide recognition that it has disrupted lives in countless ways. The federal stimulus package passed in the United States stipulates that institutions extend flexibility to their student population during the crisis. The UC Merced Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option from letter grade to Pass/No Pass (P/NP) up to the final day of instruction of any course in the Summer 2020 session for which they are enrolled.
These guidelines are meant for undergraduates, academic advisors and faculty to inform guidance on a P/NP grade choice. Academic advisors are an important resource for consultation. For information on grade options, see https://registrar.ucmerced.edu/policies/grades/updates-grading-options.
Changing the grading option to P/NP provides flexibility and could also have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that instructors talk with their students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their academic advisors and their degree program(s) before requesting this change.
The following are important considerations to guide decision-making:
FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE SUMMER 2020 SESSIONS, ALL UC MERCED UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT P/NP GRADES: UC Merced degree programs typically require students to utilize the letter grade option for all of their required courses. All undergraduate degree programs have agreed to temporarily waive this requirement for all Summer 2020 sessions.
STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO APPLY FOR POSTGRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDY — Letter Grade requirement. While a vast majority of educational institutions in the U.S. have moved to providing a Summer 2020 P/NP grading option, there is a small chance that medical/professional/graduate schools may not accept a grading option of P/NP for some courses (referenced as “letter grade” requirement risk in the flowchart below).
STUDENTS WORKING ON RAISING THEIR GPA TO BE IN GOOD STANDING. Students who need to raise their GPA above a 2.0 to be in good standing or for purposes of financial aid may be harmed by the adoption of P/NP grades, as they are not included in GPA calculations.
STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE VETERANS BENEFITS: Students who receive veterans or veterans dependent benefits should seek guidance from UC Merced’s Veterans Services: veteranservices@ucmerced.edu.
MAINTAINING SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID: In addition to GPA, a student must maintain “Satisfactory Academic Progress” (SAP). As indicated in the Federal Stimulus Package language, students choosing to adopt P/NP grading option will maintain SAP, as P/NP grades still figure into the SAP calculation. Otherwise, P/NP does not have a financial aid impact.
PASS/NO PASS DEFINITION: The grade P is assigned for a letter grade of C-minus or better. If the student earns a grade of D-plus or below, the grade will be recorded as NP. In both cases, the student’s grade will not be computed into the grade point average.
Process for students interested in changing grading option
Students interested in making a grade option change should consult with an academic advisor on any of the above factors or additional questions, and then go to MyRegistration and select the Change Grading Option. Students have until the final day of instruction of the 2020 Summer session for which they are enrolled to change their grading option. The flowchart below may be useful for some members of the academic community as they work through grading options.

Merced,6-May-2020,"CARES Act Funding for Student Aid
May 6, 2020
To: All undergraduate and graduate students
May 6, 2020
 
Dear Students,
 
As part of the CARES Act, UC Merced has applied for and been awarded approximately $13 million. Half of that money is designated for direct support for students, the other half to assist the university with financial loss and additional expense incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universities are still receiving direction from the federal Department of Education on guidelines for the institutional support, and recently received final clarification on the direct student aid support. We have posted that guidance on our Student Resource page .
 
The federal criteria included students who are Title IV financial aid eligible and guidelines that it be disbursed during the current academic year (spring and summer). UC Merced established a work group to develop principles and a proposal to disburse the funds to UC Merced students.
 
The campus principles include:
Recognition that all students have been impacted by COVID-19.
Funds should go to student populations with the highest financial need.
Allocations should be awarded with ease for students.
Financial support for students during this pandemic will be coordinated with other support for students, including Basic Needs, Rapid Rehousing and Emergency Funds.
Institutional funds will be identified to provide some assistance to students who are undocumented and who filed a Dream application.
 
Awards will be provided to students who meet all of the following eligibility criteria:
Title IV aid-eligible;
Currently enrolled in spring and/or summer;
Did not receive a prorated housing and meal plan refund in the spring (excluded from receiving a spring CARES Act award, but may be eligible for a summer award if enrolled or a special circumstances award);
Not enrolled through UC Merced Extension or in a non-degreed program.
 
By the end of the week, we will start to disburse funds to students who have a FAFSA on file, which verifies Title IV eligibility. For students, particularly graduate students, a process will be communicated on how to submit a FAFSA. Students who were eligible for relief in their housing and dining plans will have that refund considered in their eligibility for CARES Act funding. For students who may not meet eligibility criteria, a process will be shared with those students on how to request special circumstance funds, which will be a coordinated use of federal, institutional and emergency funds. An additional allocation of funds will be available to support students registered for UC Merced’s summer session.
 
Please know that there are resources available beyond the CARES funds. The Dean of Students Office website is a good place to start. You can also go to the Basic Needs website.
 
Please let me know if you have questions or if we can assist.
 
Take care,

Dear Campus Community,
 
California acted early and swiftly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in part due to that decision, it now appears the state can begin easing some restrictions based on local conditions. While that bodes well for retailers, restaurants, manufacturers and other businesses — and those who rely on them for employment — UC Merced is still considering when and how to safely return to in-person instruction and student residency on campus as we prepare for the 2020-21 academic year.
 
Please be assured that faculty and staff are actively planning for multiple scenarios — from modified in-person instruction to hybrid course delivery to a continuation of remote learning — with, of course, the goal being a return to in-person coursework as soon as it is safe to do so. We are rigorously examining what the “new normal” should be for classrooms, labs and residence halls, based on projections from state, federal and UC scientists. While our mission remains teaching, research and public service, our priority will always be the safety of our campus community.
 
Over the past week, we have communicated to campus about federal CARES Act student aid distribution and guidance for sum mer session grading . We also recently added an “EN ESPAÑOL” link on the COVID-19 Parents page , where campus communications are available in Spanish.
 
UC Merced faculty continue to share their research and expertise through the media:
 
A study by a team including Suzanne Sindi of applied mathematics about fatal diseases caused by prions .
 
Political scientist Haifeng Huang’s interpretation of world opinion toward China because of COVID-19.
 
Sociologist Edward Flores’ projection of the number of Central Valley workers left out of current federal relief programs.
 
Don’t forget to join us online May 16 for a truly amazing virtual commencement ceremony — the first in the history of the University of California — to celebrate the success of our graduates. And on May 15, our signature Innovate to Grow event will happen online as well. Our normal lives may be on temporary pause, but the great work of UC Merced continues.
 
Please keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.

Riverside,22-Jan-2020,"As you all may be aware, there have been reported cases of coronavirus from Wuhan City, China.   

According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), these are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever. Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia. They're usually spread through direct contact with an infected person. 

To that extent, for our UC Riverside students, the treatment is mainly supportive. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread includes regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. 

Additionally, avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. 

If you have any concerns,  please contact the UCR Student Health Center: (951) 827-3031.",141,cal,1
Riverside,28-Jan-2020,"To the Campus Community,
You may have seen news reports on the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Travel-related
cases have been reported in Japan, Australia, France, Thailand, and the United States. CDC is
conducting entry screenings of passengers on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, China
at 5 major airports, including LAX. Recently the CDC, Los Angeles County Department of Public
Health and Orange County Health Care Agency have confirmed a positive case of 2019-nCoV.
The CDC has deployed teams to California to assist in clinical management, contact tracing,
and communications.
There are no known exposures in Riverside or the UC Riverside campus. UCR is working
closely with colleagues, clinical partners, and public health officials to actively monitor the
situation and prepare for potential cases. We realize there may be many questions about the
virus and its impact on our community. The FAQ below is intended to help answer basic
questions about the virus and UCR response.
If any member of the community suspects they have influenza or the Coronavirus, they should
stay home. There is some evidence that infected persons may still spread 2019-nCoV even if
they are not showing symptoms. Students should contact the Student Health Center at (951)
827-3031. Faculty, staff, and other UCR members should contact their primary medical
provider.
The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak comes, unsurprisingly, at a time of year when many of us
get run down and catch colds or the flu. While we have launched a screening process for the
novel coronavirus, it is a good time for everyone to refresh their memory on best health
practices to prevent the spread of any virus:
Always practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water frequently.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and dispose of tissue in trash immediately.
Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs.
Get your annual flu vaccine.
The UCR campus will continue to operate as normal. Campus leadership along with public
health partners will continue to evaluate the situation and provide updates to the UCR
campus. Health advisories and new information will be shared via email and through the UCR
Student Health Services and Environmental Health & Safety websites.",385,cal,1
Riverside,29-Jan-2020,"Travel Restrictions For UCR Personnel
All non-essential domestic and international travel will be suspended, effective Monday, March 16 and until further notice.

Essential travel must be registered with UC Away. Travel booked through UC Connexxus are automatically registered with UC Away.  However, travel booked through other means (e.g., Expedia or directly through an airlines website) will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
We strongly advise students to refrain from personal, non-essential travel (both domestic and international) during spring break. UCR recommends all domestic personal travel be registered with UC Away.
Outbound Travel Plans
International Travel
All non-essential international travel is suspended
Essential University-related international travel must be registered with UC Away. If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.
All essential university-related international travel to a country at travel warning level 3 or alert level 2 must request and receive advance written approval from within the cognizant organization/unit up to the Vice Chancellor or Dean, with final approval from the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor. 
If you decide to travel outside of the United States, please be aware that the CDC may issue new international travel warnings without notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry.  Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.

Domestic Travel
All non-essential domestic travel is suspended.
Essential University-related domestic travel must be registered with UC Away. Travel booked through UC Connexxus are automatically registered with UC Away.  However, travel booked through other means (e.g., Expedia or directly through an airlines website) will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
The university strongly recommends that all personal domestic travel be registered with UC Away.
Inbound/Return Travel Plans
UC community members who are currently traveling on university-related business in a country designated with a CDC Warning  Level 2 and 3 Travel Notice should plan to immediately leave the area. Upon return, travelers from Level 3 countries, both for university-related business or personal travel, will likely be expected to quarantine for 14 days.  

UCR travelers will not be allowed to return to campus until after the quarantine ends.  Accordingly, faculty and staff should be in touch with their supervisors to determine measures for remote work. Similarly, students should be in contact with their instructors and academic advisors to identify appropriate measures to complete required assignments or tests.

UC Travel Insurance - COVID-19 FAQ's
The UC has arranged for employees and students traveling on official university business to be covered for a wide variety of accidents and incidents while away from the campus or primary workplace. Review the UC Travel Insurance Coverage for more information.

Who is Covered under the UC Travel Policy?
University travelers include employees, medical residents, students, fellows, and guests with travel paid by the University.  Personal travel such as vacation travel, is not covered by the UC Travel program.

How can I find out what is covered by the UC Travel policy?

The UC Travel generally covers emergency services, so routine health services would not be covered.  The most frequently used coverage is the accident medical and security extraction coverage.

With the COVID 19 crisis, the most common benefit used is the trip cancellation/interruption coverage. A summary of the benefits is located here: 

Student Travel Insurance Benefits
Staff/Faulty Travel Insurance Benefits

The benefits summary has an exclusion for bacterial or viral infection.  Is there coverage if I get sick due to Coronavirus and have to be hospitalized? 

Coverage decisions are made by the insurance carrier Chubb and we have been informed that Coronavirus is a medical condition, thus if the disease is contracted while traveling overseas under this policy the medical benefit coverage would respond. However, please note that Chubb would have to comply with the local quarantine protocols in such cases.  

How can I cancel my travel my registered trip?                                           

If your registered trip should be canceled and fees are incurred, complete the form below:

Employee Trip Cancellation/Interruption Claim Form
Student Trip Cancellation/Interruption Claim Form
What if I am stranded while traveling abroad?

United HealthCare Group (UHCG) can assist stranded travelers wanting to return home. Travelers should first work with travel agent/ airline directly to book a flight. If they are not able to obtain a flight back, UHCG will work directly with travelers: https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/_files/uc-travel-insurance/travel-assistance-services.pdf . Note, even if travelers did not previously register their UC Trip, they can still obtain assistance from UHCG.",758,cal,1
Riverside,30-Jan-2020,"As you know, UC is closely monitoring the dynamic developments regarding the 2019 Novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Today, the United Nations World Health Organization declared a
global health emergency as the number of cases has continued to expand to more than a
dozen countries. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also
confirmed that the coronavirus has spread between two people in the United States, which is
the first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in this country.
The health and safety of our UC community is our No. 1 priority. To that end, following
both CDC and State Department guidance, I am directing the UC community to temporarily
avoid all non-essential travel to China, while it is designated with a Warning Level 3 Travel
Notice.
Each campus and medical center should take immediate steps to develop a review
and approval process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential or if it
can be postponed.
In order to ensure the well-being and safety of those who must travel during this time, it is of
utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related
purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before
their expected departure and update this information as changes occur before and during
travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps
keeps the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks

UCR faculty, staff and students should be aware that the U.S. Department of State issued its highest advisory level 4 alerting a do not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus on Jan. 31, 2020.

In addition, commercial airline carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.

University of California President Napolitano directed the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China on Jan. 30, 2020.

The campus was required to develop a review and approval process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential or if it can be postponed. UCRs prior review and approval process for travel to China is provided below.

University of California restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal-related, but such travelers should be aware of travel risks and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.

Approval Process Prior to Travel
All non-essential travel to China is restricted until further notice. All travelers who would like to engage in essential travel to China (defined in the following categories) must obtain prior approval as follows:

Faculty: Faculty essential travel is defined as that which is required to:

preserve the safety of a research subject and which is not possible to be postponed; or
preserve the results of a research activity and which is not possible to be postponed.
By way of comparison, faculty essential travel does not include travel to attend educational conferences. This is just one example of non-essential travel and does not include all other activities that would also be considered non-essential travel.

To request approval to engage in essential travel, faculty should contact their Dean in writing. Such travel may only be approved by one of the school Deans. The Deans may consult with the UCR Risk Management.

Staff: Staff travel is considered non-essential.

To request an exception to the determination that UCR-related travel to China for staff is non-essential, staff should contact in writing one of the following cognizant offices depending on where they are assigned organizationally: Chancellor (for staff in University Advancement, University Communications, Governmental & Community Relations, Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Office of Legal Affairs, Research and Economic Development, Student Affairs, and Chief Compliance Office); Executive Vice Chancellor & Provost; Deans; UCR Health CEO; or Vice Chancellor Planning, Budget & Administration. Such an exemption may only be approved by one of the University officials listed above. UCR Risk Management is available for consultation.

Students and Trainees (Clinical and Non-Clinical): Student and trainee essential travel is defined as that which is necessary to meet a graduation requirement and which is not possible to be postponed.

To request approval to engage in essential travel, students and trainees should contact in writing the Dean of their respective school or of the Graduate Division. Such essential travel may only be approved by the Dean of the relevant school or the Graduate Division.

Deans of the schools and the Graduate Division are responsible for ensuring that students and trainees are aware of this requirement, and Department Chairs/Directors are responsible for ensuring that their faculty are aware of and adhere to this requirement.",537,cal,2
Riverside,4-Feb-2020,"Dear Campus Community,
We would like to take this opportunity to make the campus aware of the universitys
response to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is a situation that is evolving
daily. University leadership is in frequent contact with the UC Office of the President,
Riverside County Public Health, our fellow UC campuses, clinical partners, and elected
officials to monitor the situation, to ensure that all appropriate precautions are taken,
and to respond quickly and effectively as matters arise.
There are no confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in Riverside or the UC Riverside campus.
UCR Response
The Student Health Center has implemented a thorough screening process, along
with a dedicated Nurse line for remote consultations. Our Housing and Dining team
has increased the number of hand sanitizers on campus. Our Environmental Health &
Safety and Student Health teams are collaborating to raise awareness of best hygiene
and flu prevention practices. Moreover, our Risk Management team is working with
registered travelers to ensure their whereabouts and prepare for any needed changes
in their travel plans.
Travel Restrictions/Registration
In response to the U.S. Department of States level 4 travel advisory, University of
California President Janet Napolitano has directed the UC community to temporarily
avoid all non-essential travel to China. Please take a few moments to review the
details of UCRs response to the directive and how we are defining essential travel for
faculty, staff, and students.
We strongly recommend that all students and employees register their university
business travel with UC Away, in order to fully leverage the benefits and protections
in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential
services.
Appropriate Treatment of Fellow Students and Employees
During this critical time, it is imperative that all students, faculty, and staff uphold a
campus culture of respect. Despite any anxiety we may feel with regard to this health
scare, there is no justification for unwarranted mistreatment or discriminatory
behavior against others.
If any member of the campus community experiences mistreatment or is a witness to
this inappropriate behavior, students should make a report to
deanofstudents@ucr.edu, and employees should consult with their direct supervisor.
Importantly, UCR strives to reinforce a respectful, safe community through our
Principles of Community and student conduct policies.

Dear UCR Community,

We write to provide a broad update on UCRs efforts to address the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  The health and safety of our community remains our top priority, and we are actively monitoring developments locally and abroad.

Presently, there are no confirmed cases in Riverside County, the city of Riverside, or the UC Riverside campus. The campus continues to operate normally.  

As noted in media coverage of COVID-19, this is a dynamic situation with COVID-19 infections significantly affecting several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran.  As a result, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), along with the UC Office of the President, have instituted travel guidance and proactive measures to prevent further spread of infection.  

Below this message, you will also find information about resources and UCRs efforts to address COVID-19.  With circumstances that appear to be changing on a regular basis, we ask that each member of the campus community stay informed about measures to prevent infection and regularly check the following website for the most up-to-date UCR information: https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus.

Riverside,5-Mar-2020,"UC campuses, health centers, and laboratories continue to work around the clock to combat
the global outbreak of novel coronavirus, including within the United States. From the earliest
days of the outbreak, the University of California has been on the front lines of response efforts
to COVID-19, leveraging the power of UC research to inform and guide our actions and
providing care for affected patients in our top-ranked hospitals. To date, three of our UC
medical centers have treated six confirmed cases of COVID-19. All five of our medical centers
have monitored at least 34 people under investigation (PUI). Each health center has
comprehensive protocols and significant experience dealing with infectious diseases. Even as
we care for patients, we are acutely mindful of our responsibilities to our employee
communities, other patients, and the public at large.
We must take this threat seriously, and we are. Combatting this virus and effectively caring
for all patients requires skillful planning and nimbly responding to quickly-evolving
circumstances. These changes may impact daily operations and the lives of faculty, staff,
students, and communities across California. In the past few days alone, the number of
countries and regions experiencing widespread community transmission has dramatically
increased, thereby increasing the risk of travel to these locations.
Given the rapidly changing conditions, and out of an abundance of caution, I am expanding
my Feb. 26 directive to avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to CDC
Level 2 (sustained community transmission) Travel Health Notice countries, in
addition to Level 3 (widespread sustained transmission) Travel Health Notice
countries. Further, individuals on our campuses with a recent travel history from a CDC

Riverside,5-Mar-2020,"Faculty Colleagues, 

UCR has been closely monitoring the status of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). It remains impossible to determine if, when, or to what extent our campus might be impacted. However, should the virus continue to spread, it is likely that some faculty, staff and students will be affected and will have to remain quarantined or isolated for a period of time. Although it seems unlikely at this time, it is even possible for disruptions as significant as closing all or part of the campus on short notice for two weeks or more. 

Beyond the immediate health risks of COVID-19, the virus also may pose significant academic risks for students. If you, your teaching assistants, or some or all of your students are unable to meet face-to-face, student learning can be disrupted. While such situations are not unusual at a university as large as UCR, this typically happens to small numbers of people for short durations of time and we are able to make adjustments and continue with business as usual. For example, a colleague can provide a lecture if an instructor is sick, an instructor can spend additional time tutoring students who miss multiple lectures, an office can be provided for a make-up exam, and a small number of grades may be delayed while students complete work missed because of unavoidable absences.

These solutions do not work when many people are impacted for longer periods of time, or if all or part of the campus must close. Postponing instruction at large scales creates very significant problems for students and the campus as a whole. UCSB experienced these problems recently when final exams were canceled due to a wildfire and time was carved out of winter quarter to reschedule fall quarter exams. The ripple effects of such scheduling changes were numerous and problematic for students.

Due to these risks, we are asking every instructor to immediately develop a continuity plan for your winter and spring quarter courses.  Below is a set of actions with links to existing and new resources to help you implement a plan that works best for each of your courses and promotes the welfare of our students.

URGENT ACTIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS 

Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook in iLearn. If the instructor or other course staff become ill or are under quarantine, this will ensure an accurate record of all assignment scores is accessible so that students can receive their course grades in a timely manner.
Ensure that remaining assignments, including final exams, can be reliably collected and graded, and the course grades computed and submitted, even if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are quarantined. Consider alternative assessment methods (e.g. online exams and presentations) for students who are ill or quarantined. 
Talk with your students about their concerns regarding attendance at lectures and final exams. Share campus information about COVID-19 and be clear about your expectations regarding attendance for healthy students.
Consider how to adjust course policies related to class attendance to avoid penalizing students who become ill or are placed under quarantine.
Remind students that if they will be unable to attend class for an extended period of time, instructors, academic advisors and Student Affairs Case Management are available to help them get back on track.
Practice good hygiene in classroom environments and encourage students to do the same.
HIGH PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS 

Visit https://keepteaching.ucr.edu/ to learn how to make the most of technology-based options for instructional continuity.
Place all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, readings, lecture materials) on iLearn, so that instructors and students can access them remotely in case they are unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine. If the course has a separate website or other online resources, provide links to them from iLearn. 
Arrange for an alternative method to deliver your lectures to your students. Options include pre-recorded video or audio (podcasting) with distribution through iLearn to ensure safe storage and sufficient bandwidth. Live video or audio also can be used with software such as Zoom. ITS is working to ensure we have sufficient software licenses for the anticipated increased demand.
Determine whether instructors for similar courses (possibly previous offerings of your course at UCR or the analogous course at another campus) have captured and stored lectures that you might use. Inquire with your department chair and colleagues at UCR and elsewhere. Also check the UC ILTI online course catalog.  
If you have unique circumstances that would not be adequately addressed by implementing these actions (e.g. laboratory, performance studio or field course), please discuss other options with your department chair and develop an appropriate instructional continuity plan. Consultation with colleagues also is encouraged, especially those who already have experience with the technologies listed above.

In addition, deans, department chairs and program directors must take the following actions to help promote instructional continuity for students.

REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR DEANS, CHAIRS AND DIRECTORS

Work with faculty in your unit to implement the actions described in the sections above.
Make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined. This may include identifying alternate instructors who could step in if the instructors of record become ill or must quarantine.
Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or students who had arranged accommodation for face-to-face instruction.
Plan to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support the academic advancement of students whose course plans were disrupted and/or who cannot return home during summer 2020. This should include current students and inbound transfers from California community colleges. 
Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already. Make faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed to support current courses. Consider building your inventory with newly captured content, and arranging for additional capture in future quarters. 
Thank you for taking these steps to prepare for possible disruptions and promote continuity of instruction at UCR. Your individual efforts to find solutions that work for our students are an essential part of campus planning and mitigation efforts. Thanks also to the joint administrative-faculty workgroup that developed an initial draft of these guidelines.

Please stay alert for additional updates from the campus.",1040,cal,3
Riverside,6-Mar-2020,"Dear Campus Community: 

The health and safety of UC Riverside faculty, staff, and students are of utmost importance. In light of the ongoing and increased concern regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the university is (1) instituting an interim policy governing university-related international travel and (2) providing updated guidance for all international and domestic travel.

1.    Interim Policy Governing University-Related International Travel

Effective immediately, the interim policy requires the following:
    All university-related international travel must be registered with UC Away (also called the UC International Travel Registry). UC Away is the University of Californias portal to register university-related and personal travel. Registration enables the university to leverage benefits and protections in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential services.
    All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmission), must be pre-approved in writing by the appropriate Vice Chancellor or Dean, prior to scheduling travel. This is consistent with the UC President Napolitanos directive to avoid all non-essential travel to CDC Level 3 and 2 countries.
    The interim policy will remain in place for six months, during which time campus feedback will be solicited. 

2.    Guidance for All International and Domestic Travel

For international travel:
    The university discourages all international, non-essential travel for now; this includes both university-related and personal travel.  
    If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.
    If you decide to travel outside of the United States, please be aware that the CDC may issue new international travel warnings without notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry.  
    For personal travel, faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to register with UC Away.  
    Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.

For domestic travel:
    The university strongly recommends that all domestic travel be registered with UC Away; this includes both university-related and personal travel.  For university-related, domestic travel booked through UC Connexxus, trips are automatically registered with UC Away.  However, travel booked through other means (e.g., Expedia or directly through an airlines website) will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
    The university recommends limiting domestic, non-essential, university-related travel, if feasible.  For university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.

We ask that everyone remain informed about measures to prevent infection and regularly check the following website for the most up-to-date UCR information: https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus.  

All members of the UCR community can help limit the spread of infection by washing your hands frequently with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, containing coughs and sneezing into a tissue or sleeve, and staying home if you are sick, especially if you have a respiratory illness and fever.

Finally, thank you for your efforts to stay informed and help prevent infection. UCR prides itself on being a safe and inclusive environment, and we are proud of the calm and reasoned manner in which our community has addressed issues related to COVID-19.",540,cal,3
Riverside,8-Mar-2020,"Dear Campus Community:

Since our last message to campus, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has increased significantly across the United States and globally. 

Late yesterday (Saturday, March 7th), Riverside County confirmed its first case of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this person is not affiliated with the UC Riverside campus. We further expect that the number of confirmed cases will continue to increase with more widespread testing.

We understand that current circumstances regarding COVID-19 may lead to worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in higher-risk populations. We further acknowledge the uncertainty and concern that this virus and its consequences have created for so many in our community. Though there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus or in the city of Riverside, the first infection could very well happen on or near campus at any time. We want to be as prepared as possible so we can move quickly should we need to.

Campus Status

The campus continues to remain open and operational. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported at UC Riverside, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully as we assess the local impact. After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low for our campus.

We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend ordinary instructional activity. In-person classroom meetings will be under normal operation for the week of March 9th, but this could change as the week progresses.

We are aware that due to their distinct local circumstances, a small number of other universities have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the California Department of Public Health, Riverside County officials, university health officials, and UC Office of the President.

To ensure that we are fully prepared, we are calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that we may need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually in the near future. 

Last week, the Provosts Office communicated a memo asking that all faculty and instructors consider, on a voluntary basis, adjusting their practices for the remaining two weeks of the quarter in order to facilitate social distancing and accommodate students who cannot attend in-person classes or take in-person finals. Tomorrow, the Provosts Office will meet with the Academic Senates Executive Council to further review senate policies affecting possible changes to course instruction, assignments, exams, grading, and syllabi.

The keepteaching.ucr.edu website provides a toolkit and resources to ensure academic continuity, in case of emergency campus closures or other disruptions that prevent instructors and students from meeting face to face. Accordingly, if the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings.

While we are not suspending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we understand the value of increased social distancing as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus; see this link from the San Francisco Department of Public Health for details.

Staff supervisors and managers are asked to assess whether their employees could work remotely, as their individual circumstances warrant and institutional conditions evolve. With these preparations in place, we will be able to scale up measures quickly and broadly across campus, if or when needed.

No decisions have been made yet to cancel or postpone large gatherings such as concerts, sporting events, conventions, or large community events; however, this remains a possibility. As such, organizers should exercise key prevention strategies in your events operation plan.

We also advise all campus units to review carefully any visitors coming to campus, including contractors, to help assure they are in good health and have not recently been in any high risk location, domestically or internationally.  Hiring managers might also consider moving on-campus interviews with job candidates to online.

Should UC Riverside need to move to hybrid or fully online campus operations, on-campus housing and dining services will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases among on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials, should it become necessary.

This situation is fluid, and it could change quickly in the Riverside community, requiring that we alter course at a moments notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on UCRs COVID-19 website or the UC Office of the Presidents COVID-19 website. We will continue to send frequent updates to the campus as circumstances change.

Travel Considerations

Last Friday, UCR issued updated travel policy and guidance, and further restrictions are anticipated as additional cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Additionally, students, faculty, and staff should consider seriously whether personal travel is necessary at this time.

Please consider the potential for additional countries to be added to the restricted travel list, which could result in difficulties getting back into the US. Travelers should be prepared or arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return from a restricted jurisdiction or if you are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID-19.

Your Health and Wellness

Finally, and most importantly, your health and wellness are of utmost importance. It is crucial for all members of the UCR community to carefully follow the recommendations for preventative care, which have the greatest likelihood of protecting ourselves as well as the larger community by diminishing the chances of transmission of the virus:

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, or, as an alternative, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Stay home if you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands.
In addition, practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the seasonal flu.

Thank you for doing your part to protect our community. Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.",1141,cal,3
Riverside,9-Mar-2020,"The University continues to closely monitor the ongoing Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID- 19)
outbreak. The health and well-being of our community remains our number one priority. In response
to the COVID-19 outbreak the University is enacting the following temporary emergency actions:
 Employees unable to work due to their own or a family members COVID-19 illness should
use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and ifthere
are no available leave balances the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative
leave to cover the absence.
 Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or
self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not
operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances, and ifthere are no
available leave balances the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave
to cover the absence.
 Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-l9 day care or school closure that
requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if
remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances
including sick leave.
 Locations may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated
to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are
directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the
nature of their work (as determined by the location) may be allowed up to 14 days of paid
administrative leave. Locations may determine which positions to designate, provided that all
health care workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.
 Academic appointees who do not accrue sick and/or vacation leave and who are not
otherwise eligible for paid medical leave under applicable provisions of the Academic
Personnel Manual will receive up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover absences as
described above.
These measures are subject to change as the situation evolves, such as if the need to extend the
availability of paid administrative leave becomes necessary. Additional information regarding
applicable leave provisions may be found within the Absence from Work policy (PPSM 2.210) that
apply to eligible policy-covered staff employees ($MG, MSP and PSS), including probationary
employees, who are impacted by this crisis. Additional information regarding applicable leave
provisions for policy-covered academic appointees may be found within the 700 Series of the
-2-
Academic Personnel Manual (APM). Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement
(CBA) should review the leave provisions in their respective CBA.
Local Catastrophic Leave Sharing Programs
Locations may consider highlighting existing catastrophic leave donation programs, if applicable, to
facilitate vacation donations on behalf of impacted employees who have exhausted paid leave. For
policy-covered staff employees, please see PPSM 2.210.III.B.l0.
Benefit Considerations
Generally, an employee granted a leave with pay will continue to receive all benefits related to
employment. Special limitations or requirements that apply to certain types of leaves are addressed
in the provisions specific to those leaves in the policy, For policy-covered staff employees, please
see PPSM 2.210.III.A.6. For policy-covered academic appointees, please see the 700 Series of the

Riverside,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Campus Community:

Thank you for your commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for everyone at UC Riverside. There are currently no known cases of COVID-19 within the UC Riverside community.

However, as local, national and global public health recommendations shift to include mitigation of transmission, we are proactively taking steps that will help to protect the community. Provided below are important updates regarding UCRs academic continuity and campus operations. These measures will allow us greater flexibility as we work to prevent further spread of COVID-19. 

ACADEMIC CONTINUITY

Instructors should accelerate their efforts to transition their course materials and instruction online and minimize in-person instruction for the remainder of winter quarter (see this memo for guidance). Additionally, following consultation with the Academic Senates Executive Council, we have determined the following changes to instruction:

Winter quarter final exams will not be held in person. Instructors are asked to communicate with students how final exams, if any, will be offered in place of in-person exams (for example: take home, online, or other alternative format).
Instructors should plan to teach spring quarter courses fully online through April 3, 2020, and prepare to continue online instruction through the remainder of the quarter, as needed. This is a precautionary measure that is being announced early to provide instructors with as much time as possible to prepare. Academic Senate further wishes to emphasize that faculty will retain ownership and control of their online instructional materials.
Students living on-campus may elect to return home through April 3, 2020. With final exams and early spring quarter instruction moving online, students may choose to return to their permanent place of residence or decide to remain in on-campus housing, where appropriate social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures will be in place. We ask all students to make the choice that is best for their own personal situations, while considering whether they have adequate access to the internet, computers, and textbooks to continue their studies effectively in an online environment.
The spring quarter measures are meant to be temporary, and will be reviewed and updated regularly. The Provosts office will continue working with the Academic Senate to provide additional guidance regarding online instruction and resources, as well as considerations for laboratory- and performance-based instruction.  Additional guidance is forthcoming.

The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs will provide specific guidance to all students, including student employees and on-campus residents.

CAMPUS OPERATIONS

Although spring quarter in-person instruction will be suspended through April 3, 2020, the campus will not be closed. Campus buildings will remain open, and most campus operations will continue. 

Please note, however, that services may be limited as some employees may be allowed to work remotely. Managers and supervisors should immediately assess whether their employees job duties can be conducted off-site, at least on a part-time basis if not full-time; and be prepared to implement these work arrangements, pending approval from their direct supervisor and cognizant Dean, Vice Provost, Vice Chancellor, or equivalent organization head.

Human Resources will soon provide additional communication to managers, supervisors, and employees about working remotely, and leave options for those who are ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Similarly, the Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development will provide information regarding research support operations.

GATHERINGS AND VISITORS

Going forward, the following guidelines have been adopted for gatherings on campus and university-hosted events:

Large Gatherings (150 people or more): Cancellation, postponement, or moving to an online platform.
Other Gatherings (Less than 150 people):  Cancellation, postponement, or moving to an online platform. If these options are not feasible, in-person gatherings for less than 150 people require approval from the Provost, in order to proceed; and must include proactive measures for social distancing and hygiene.
Campus Visits (15 people or more): Cancellation or postponement of non-essential visits to campus by groups of more than 15 people. This would include, for example, campus tours and other events that bring visitors to campus.
All Other Visits (15 people or less): These visits should be conducted online or via teleconference.
Athletic Events: All UC Riverside-hosted athletic events are scheduled to continue, however, events will now be fan-less, meaning there should be no fans at the events.
ADDITIONAL MEASURES  SOCIAL DISTANCING AND HYGIENE

To prevent infection, we recommend adhering to the following social distancing practices:

Vulnerable populations should limit outings and not attend large gatherings. Vulnerable populations are people 60 years of age and older; and people with health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and weakened immune systems.
If you are sick, stay home. Do not come to school or work, travel, or participate in large gatherings.
If you have flu-like symptoms or suspect that you may have been exposed to COVID-19: Students should contact Student Health Services or their primary care physician.  Staff and faculty should their primary care physician, and UCR Health will be providing additional resources soon for all UCR employees.
Important reminders regarding hygiene: (1) regularly wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, (2) cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough or sneeze, and (3) clean and disinfect surfaces often.
For more information about social distancing and hygiene practices for the workplace and home, please visit the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website.
We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice will have broad impacts and will be challenging and disruptive for many of you, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation.

We are grateful to the staff throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles. Your work is critically important at this time and we greatly value you and your contributions. 

Please stay up-to-date on the latest communications at the UCR COVID-19 website. We will continue regular updates and provide details about modified campus operations, as new information is available.",989,cal,3
Riverside,11-Mar-2020,"As part of our commitment to the health of our campus community, UCR Health, the clinical faculty practice of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, has established a new resource for UCR faculty and staff. 

If you have traveled internationally or been in contact with someone in the past 30 days who has COVID-19, plus are experiencing a fever with cough or trouble breathing contact the 24/7 Hotline at 844-827-6827. 

If you are experiencing cold and flu symptoms, but have not traveled internationally or been in contact with someone with COVID-19, contact your primary care physician or healthcare insurance for more information.

This resource is available only to UCR employees, and not the general public. UCR students should continue to contact Student Health Services at 951-827-3031 for assistance.

As a reminder, there are several steps each of us can take to slow or reduce the spread of germs: (1) wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, (2) cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough or sneeze, (3) clean and disinfect surfaces often, and (4) stay home if you are sick.

Riverside,11-Mar-2020,"s the situation surrounding the novel coronavirus continues to change rapidly, UC Riverside is taking proactive measures to limit the risk of COVID-19 to the campus community.

Here are some of the latest developments:

Campus is closed

The campus is closed until April 3 . There are no known cases of COVID-19 on the UC Riverside campus or in the city of Riverside.

 Winter quarter final exams will not proceed as in-person classroom exams. Instruction for the entire spring quarter will be remote. 

University leadership is in frequent contact with the UC Office of the President, other UC campuses, Riverside County health officials, clinical partners, and elected officials. Within the campus, a cross-section of university officials is meeting at least daily to discuss updates.

For an up-to-date status of the campus, and links to the latest related COVID-19 communications, visit https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus .

Here is the full announcement by Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox and Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Thomas M. Smith regarding the measures being taken.

First week of spring quarter classes switch to online

In-person classes will continue for the week of March 9. The provosts office has requested that faculty and instructors facilitate social distancing among students and make accommodations for students who cannot attend class in person. Social distancing refers to limiting proximity among people and exposure to large public gatherings.

Instruction for winter quarter ends on March 13, and the quarter ends on March 20. Spring quarter is scheduled to begin on March 30. The first week of spring quarter classes will be online only. 

Instructors are developing continuity plans for spring quarter, in the event classes remain online-only beyond April 3, and using the resources found at the https://keepteachingucr.edu website and these guidelines developed by the provosts office and the Academic. Among those resources is information for online instruction.  

The colleges and schools at UC Riverside are developing plans to increase summer 2020 course offerings to offset winter or spring classes that may be disrupted.

Student housing and quarantines

On-campus housing and dining services remain open.

It is extremely unlikely there would be a need for a full residence hall self-quarantine. If a 
student is ill and a medical provider assesses and determines the student is considered a person 
under investigation for COVID-19, the student will be managed by a health care provider and in and in
a hospital Ñ not on campus.

Students may be subject to self-quarantine as a result of returning from a Level 3 country (China, Italy, South Korea, and Iran); having been in contact with someone from a Level 3 country; or having been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. The university will support self-quarantining in campus housing, but will encourage self-quarantine at students homes as an alternative.

If the student becomes symptomatic while in the 14-day self-quarantine, the university would 
contact Riverside County health officials to follow correct protocols, including transport to a 
medical facility.

UCR students experiencing respiratory illness (fever, cough, shortness of breath) or flu-like symptoms should contact Student Health Services at the 24/7 hotline at  (951) 827-3031 for support and guidance.

Faculty and staff working 

If employees are sick, have recently traveled from a region with COVID-19, or have had contact with someone known or suspected to have COVID-19, they should stay home. 
 
The university is working to identify work-from-home guidance for faculty and staff.

Staff whose family members Ñ spouse or domestic partner, parents, or children Ñ are home sick with COVID-19 may be eligible for leave.  

UCR Health has developed a 24/7 health hotline for UCR faculty and staff experiencing cold and flu symptoms at (844)-827-6827. The resource is for faculty and staff only.  

Information on how UC's health plans cover COVID-19 is available here.
 

Research to continue

Research activities are proceeding but researchers are advised to follow new recommendations such as practicing social distancing and safe hygiene. Read here for more details on the guidelines.

Travel discouraged

All university travel must be registered. International travel is discouraged, and travel to high-risk countries must be preapproved in writing by a vice chancellor or dean. Nonessential domestic travel should be limited. 

Travelers returning from the highest-risk (Level 3 Travel Notice) countries should expect to be quarantined for 14 days. The university is working with registered travelers to ensure their whereabouts and prepare for changes in travel plans.  

Large events discouraged

Gatherings of more than 150 people should be canceled, postponed, or moved online. If this is not feasible for in-person gatherings of fewer than 150 people, approval of the provost is required. Campus visits of 15 people or more should be canceled; other visits should be moved online if possible. 

All UC Riverside-hosted athletic events are scheduled to continue, however, events will now be fan-less, meaning there should be no fans at the events. 

If you have any questions regarding deleting an event from the UCR events calendar, contact support-ucrevents@ucr.edu.
 
Cleaning protocols 

Hand sanitizers have been made available in university housing and dining areas. A new Centers for Disease Controls-approved chemical disinfectant has been employed. Cleaning has been increased in classrooms and university-owned housing, targeting high-touch areas such as restrooms and elevators.  

Environmental Health & Safety has worked with campus departments and identified safe standard operating procedures. This includes identifying proper ventilation, food delivery, access to virtual learning, daily medical checks, and waste collection.

Ombuds Office

The Ombuds Office is planning to stay fully operational and available to the campus over the coming weeks.  However, the office plans to shift to interacting primarily via phone, Zoom, and email.

Zoom use

Instructors seeking additional information on how to conduct classes using Zoom, can find additional information here. A faculty member at the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering prepared a tutorial.",960,cal,3
Riverside,11-Mar-2020,"Dear UCR research community,

I would like to follow up on the Chancellors message this afternoon about academic continuity and campus operations.  As mentioned in the message, we are NOT suspending research activities at this time but want to share several actions and recommendations.

Despite many uncertainties about how the COVID-19 epidemic will affect the research enterprise in the intermediate and longer term, now it is time to start planning for potential serious disruptions. We are not alone in facing these uncertainties and have been in communication with other universities about their plans of action. I am thankful to the dynamic collaboration among research leaders and administrators in the academic community who are sharing best practices about how to confront this unprecedented situation. In particular, I want to acknowledge our colleagues at Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley for their research community communications from which we have borrowed and adapted to our campus in the guidelines below.

We would like to remind you that per UC policies, in no event should researchers take materials other than secure laptops, data storage devices, and other similar devices offsite (e.g., to their homes) to maintain research continuity during a curtailment. All essential research must continue within the confines of appropriate laboratory space. Please exercise extreme care when transporting data storage devices or accessing data remotely and contact Information Technology Solutions if you need assistance. If in doubt about these restrictions, please contact the relevant RED office for further assistance.

RED has arranged for all essential functions, such as vivarium care, to continue as usual (similar to the holiday breaks).  All other functions will also continue as usual except that most meetings of compliance committees will take place via Zoom or by phone. We anticipate minimal impact to our services.

Each individual researcher, lab, and/or research facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan to meet their unique needs, but we strongly encourage you to consider the following guidelines.

Immediate Measures

To reduce the potential transmission of the COVID-19 coronavirus (or other colds and flu) in the coming weeks, I ask that all campus labs and research facilities put in place the following measures:

Require that all personnel who are feeling unwell stay home until they no longer have symptoms. Further guidance on personnel policies will be distributed to campus later today
Remind all personnel to practice sanitary measures such as washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, using hand sanitizer if handwashing sinks are not available, avoiding touching their face, and covering coughs and sneezes with your elbow
Explore and implement measures to reduce density and allow social distancing of lab/research personnel. For example, when possible increase spacing between researchers or have personnel come to the lab in shifts
Review opportunities for lab personnel and support staff to work remotely, even consider modifying and conducting research activities fully remotely in the short term
Increase proactive cleaning and disinfecting of laboratory and communal spaces, including lab benches and chairs, equipment, common spaces, etc.
Many scientific conferences and other research community meetings are being cancelled or are permitting remote participation. Limit your research group travel according to the UCR guidelines for travel (https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus#information_for_travelers)
Consider cancelling or postponing field research trips, as they present unique risks because of shared housing, eating meals together, and challenges of sending someone home should they become ill during an extended trip
Longer Term Planning for Research Continuity
Principal Investigators and Research Managers should begin scenario planning now for the potential continuation of research and campus operations with reduced or remote staffing if significant numbers of research or research support personnel become ill or large-scale self-isolation is required.  

PIs should plan for the following possibilities:

Be prepared for some of your laboratory workforce to fall ill or be required to self-isolate
Be prepared to decontaminate the workspace of an ill researcher in your laboratory. If assistance is needed please contact Facility Services (FS), which has implemented new cleaning protocols. While FS can take care of common areas and areas outside the lab, decontamination of the actual research surfaces will need coordination with the lab personnel to make sure no experiments are affected and lab chemicals are not accidentally mixed with cleaning products
Be prepared for core facilities and other fee-for-service resources to become unavailable 
Be prepared for critical supply orders, including controlled substances, to be delayed. PIs should work with their building manager to coordinate essential deliveries.
Be prepared for building or laboratory access to be curtailed. The campus will notify the affected communities as soon as possible. Assume that essential access for equipment maintenance and critical laboratory experiments will continue.
Be prepared that repairs performed by Facilities Services and other campus and non-campus service providers may be delayed
Be prepared that processing of visas by the federal government may be delayed, resulting in delayed appointments
Steps you can take now to ensure continuity of critical functions in case of a severe outbreak:

Identify procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention (e.g., cell culture maintenance, animal studies, etc.).
Assess and prioritize critical laboratory activities. Create an inventory of laboratory chemicals and sensitive laboratory instrumentation and equipment, and share this information with your building manager and EH&S. You can update your chemical inventory by accessing UC Chemicals
(https://ehs.ucr.edu/laboratory/chemical/chemical-inventory)
Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed, or delayed
Identify key personnel able to safely perform essential activities to insure the continuity of your laboratorys research capability
Ensure that you have access to up-to-date email and telephone contact information (including cell phones) for your critical staff
Cross-train research staff to substitute for others who may be out sick or unable to come to work
Ensure that staff have the appropriate, up-to-date training
Document critical step-by-step instructions for laboratory procedures
Encourage all researchers to be familiar with each others work if an absence would threaten the loss of experiments (such as which cells need transferring to new media, etc.)
Coordinate with colleagues who have similar research activities to identify ways to ensure mutual support and coverage of critical activities
Review contingency plans and emergency procedures with researchers and staff
Maintain a sufficient inventory of critical supplies that may be affected by global shipping delays. Inform your building manager if your lab relies on regularly scheduled supplies such as liquid nitrogen, dry ice, or compressed gasses.
Contact your departmental leadership, building manager, and Office of Emergency Management staff if you need assistance in reviewing your business continuity plans 
Other safety considerations:

Ensure that individuals performing critical tasks have been adequately trained and understand whom to contact with technical or safety questions. If you need assistance in developing Standard Operating Procedures for research processes, contact EH&S for guidance (www.ehs.ucr.edu), ehs@ucr.edu or by phone (951) 827-5528.
Avoid performing high-risk procedures alone. When working alone is necessary, exercise extreme caution.
Ensure that research team members notify colleagues of their schedule when working alone for an extended period of time
Ensure that hazardous materials (e.g., radioactive, biohazards, chemicals) are properly secured
 
Contract- and Grant-related questions:

Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) is reviewing questions relating to the allowability of costs associated with any disruptions to sponsored projects stemming from COVID-19
Send questions to your departmental business offices about who should coordinate with SPA
For a cost to be allowable, it will require consistent treatment across all funding sources
The federal funding agencies are working on a unified message in this regard, and once published, SPA will share it with the UCR community
Coronavirus research on campus:

Note that all PIs must have all the necessary compliance approvals prior to performing any coronavirus-related research or work on campus (including helping state and federal agencies screen patient samples). This includes requesting or accepting COVID-19 samples (patient or otherwise).
Finally, I would like to echo the Chancellors message that it is imperative that all members of UCRs community uphold and respect campus culture and our Principles of Community during this time.  Employees are reminded not to stigmatize anyone based on national origin. Students who experience any mistreatment or witness inappropriate behavior can make a report to deanofstudents@ucr.edu. Employees should consult with their direct supervisor if they witness or experience inappropriate behavior.",1369,cal,3

Riverside,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

I first want to thank all of you for your efforts as we respond to the challenges related to the many impacts of the quickly evolving COVID-19 situation.  There are currently no known cases of COVID-19 within the UC Riverside Community.

It is important for all of us to remember that as a school of medicine, we serve not only students, but our patients and community.  We must continue to uphold our responsibility to all of these components of our mission, and the health and safety of our SOM and broader community is our number 1 priority.  The steps we are taking outlined below are aligned with those of our UC medical school colleagues and we will continue to review and update as this situation continues to evolve.

We will are also creating a web site to supplement the UCR site on COVID-19, and will provide an update once this is available.

ACADEMIC CONTINUITY

The campus and School of Medicine remain open.  While the undergraduate campus has elected to move to full remote education through the end of the quarter (April 3), there are aspects of medical and graduate biomedical education that require a different approach.

For medical students: Dr. Brig Willis announced on Monday, March 9 a plan for continuing education for medical students.  These guidelines will be in place immediately and will be regularly updated:

In general, all non-clinical group activities for students will be replaced by online or distance learning options.

All required in-person activities (gross anatomy lab functions, in-person proctored assessments such as OSCEs and NBME Shelf exams, etc.) will be postponed until the curtailment is finished.

All student clinical rotational duties will continue as scheduled, and students will follow the policies and procedures of their clinical sites. The only exception to this is the guidance that students should not participate in the care of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 until further notice.

No travel to international sites or sites with known outbreaks will be approved for student rotations.

We will post the full action plan for Medical Education and Subunits on the website as soon as we can.  You can also reach out to Dr. Willis for questions.  He is also scheduling town halls today and tomorrow to address questions.

For graduate students: Dr. Willis and Dr. Byron Ford announced a joint plan for graduate education as noted below.  

The changes to classroom delivery do not affect lab attendance or small group lab meetings.

Research activities will not be suspended during this time.  

BMSC 252 seminars have been postponed until further notice.

Block 4 will begin as scheduled on March 16, but could be replaced by online or distance learning options, if indicated.

Review/grant writing courses (BMSC 260A-C) may be replaced by online or distance learning options if indicated by the course instructors or when the quarter begins.

BMSC 254/Pizza Friday will continue as scheduled at this time but may be replaced by online or distance learning options if indicated by the course instructors.

SOM OPERATIONS

Working from home or remotely:  In line with other UC schools of medicine, at this time, the option to work remotely should be reserved for those who are ill, may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, or who are caring for family members.   However, all staff members should check with their respective supervisor directly regarding concerns and/or required accommodations, in order to obtain the official approval to work remotely.  In addition, please keep in mind that we are the medical school and have many units which need to continue operations.  To the best or our ability, we will need to ensure necessary support.   Please see below for UCOP and UCR guidelines on remote work and instructions for those who have roles where remote work is not operationally feasible:

Paid leave

Staff and faculty unable to work due to their own or family members COVID-19 illness should use their available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, paid time off or other accrued leave). Employees without sufficient leave time will be granted up to 14 days of paid administrative leave.

Staff and faculty unable to work due to a COVID-19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use their available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, paid time off or other accrued leave).

Staff and faculty unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible.  If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use their available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, paid time off or other accrued leave).  Employees without sufficient leave time will be granted up to 14 days of paid administrative leave.

Academic appointees who do not accrue sick and/or vacation leave and who are not otherwise eligible for paid medical leave under applicable provisions of the Academic Personnel Manual will receive up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover absences as described above.

Employees and supervisors who have questions may contact SOM Human Resources at 951-827-7954 or at human.resources@medsch.ucr.edu.

Operations planning: All units are asked to create a continuity plan should it become necessary for more employees to work remotely to insure ongoing business operations.  This may include plans for staggered hours, partial telecommuting and other social distancing strategies and applies to both our clinical and non-clinical operations.

UCR HEALTH

UCR Health clinics remain open and are serving our Inland Empire community. 

In addition, UCR Health has established a hotline for UCR faculty and staff who have questions about COVID-19: 844-827-6827.

We will continue to provide regular updates as this unprecedented situation evolves. Please refer to the latest advisories  and FAQs on the UCR COVID-19 website.",754,cal,3
Riverside,12-Mar-2020,"This message is intended for all UCR employees, including but not limited to faculty, staff (non-represented and represented), undergraduate student employees, graduate teaching assistants, and graduate research assistants.

The University remains open and operational, albeit with some adjustments to normal activities.

Effective immediately and pending approval from your supervisor, employees may have the option to work remotely. 

No campus office, unit, or department can be closed (i.e., no employees physically working on campus), without prior approval from the cognizant Vice Chancellor or Provost/EVC.

Please read this entire email carefully and consult with your supervisor, before making any changes to your individual work situation or within your office, unit, or department.

We continue to closely monitor the ongoing Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The health and well-being of our community remains our number one priority. We encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support their employees in caring for their health Ñ and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 Ñ while still enabling them to continue to perform the important work they do. Therefore, UC is enacting the following temporary emergency provisions:

UC SYSTEM-WIDE PROVISIONS

1.  Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member's COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the  absence.

2.  Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances, and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the  absence.

3.   Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances including sick leave.

4.   If remote work is considered to be operationally feasible, the employee will be considered to be on paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the location), may be allowed up to 14 days of paid administrative leave. Locations may determine which positions to designate, provided that all health care workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.

5.    Benefits  Generally, an employee granted a leave with pay will continue to receive all benefits related to employment.  Special limitations or requirements that apply to certain types of leaves are addressed in the provisions specific to those leaves in PPSM 2.210.III.A.6.

UC RIVERSIDE GUIDANCE

The following guidance is provided to assist you with using the UC Provisions noted above. We recognize that we are operating in a fast moving and fluid environment, but we wanted to get out some key information to everyone as soon as possible.  We expect we will have to augment this information in the near future:

1.  The UCR campus is remaining open at this time.  However, as staff participate in telecommuting and/or use some or all of the 14 day paid administrative leave provision, departments/units may be only partially staffed at their physical location (and may find some reasonable rotation of staff workable).  If for some reason a department needs to physically close completely, the department/unit head should seek prior approval from the cognizant Vice Chancellor or Provost/EVC (and from the appropriate Dean for the schools and colleges).

2.   Consult your supervisor if you would like to pursue telecommuting or request to use the up to 14 days paid administrative leave option if you are eligible. This administrative leave is a single allocation of up to 14 work days at the current FTE level, but these days do not need to be consecutive.   The allocation of these 14 days is based on the employee being directed not to come to work AND the University/Supervisor determination that they are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work. This determination will need to be documented in writing.  If these criteria are met, the allocation of the 14 days will be granted.  Note that all health care workers are exempt from this category of designation.

3.  To assess whether remote work is operationally feasible, refer to the Assessing the Feasibility of Remote Work during the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak Guidelines.

4.  To indicate you are using some of the 14 day paid administrative leave in the UCR Time & Attendance Reporting System (TARS), select other leave and choose the Administrative  Paid (PA) Leave type.

5.  For all staff, TAs and Graduate Research Assistants, the same policy considerations will apply, including the option for up to 14 days of paid administrative leave (if they qualify).  Graduate Research Assistants should consult with their supervisor/PI on their eligibility for paid administrative leave, as we expect there will be on-campus research work for them as campus research work will not be restricted. TAs should consult with their supervisor particularly how they can fulfill their role when courses are not being taught in person. UCR will provide more details for TAs prior to the start of Spring quarter. We understand that some TAs and Graduate Assistants may have more than one supervisor, for separate appointments, and therefore they will need to check with each appropriate supervisor.

6.   For employees who are undergraduate students the same policy considerations apply, including the option of up to 14 work days of paid administrative leave (which do not need to be consecutive), if they qualify. Some undergraduate student employees may have their duties impacted by the campus actions relative to in person class meetings, and UCR will work to provide additional guidance for these individuals prior to the start of Spring quarter.

We recognize that the COVID-19 outbreak and our decisions in response to the outbreak affect our entire community, including the staff, students and faculty who work and study here. Please accept our thanks for your continued cooperation, patience, and understanding while we adjust and provide guidance to this fluid and unprecedented situation.

Please anticipate additional email communications and guidance in response to the outbreak. In addition, the UCR COVID-19 Outbreak website will continually be updated.  We will have additional communications to supervisors and staff, specifically prior to the start of the Spring quarter. 

Represented Staff should contact Labor Relations at Labor.Relations@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns.

Staff not covered by a collective bargaining unit should contact Human Resources at HRPolicy@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns.

Graduate student employees should contact graddiv@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns. 

Thank you again.",1142,cal,3
Riverside,13-Mar-2020,"In response to the March 13 public health order from the Riverside County Public Health Officer, UC Riverside is making immediate adjustments to our operations in order to protect the health and safety of our community.

The university will continue to expand its transition to remote work staffing and instruction. We are working to determine essential personnel who may continue to work physically on site to support critical functions. Employees will receive more information from their department, unit, or college heads prior to Monday. 

Residence Halls remain open and residents can elect to remain on campus if they choose.

Winter quarter final exams, along with instruction the first week of spring quarter (through April 3), will continue remotely as planned.

Thank you for your continued understanding and patience in light of this rapidly changing COVID-19 situation.",136,cal,3
Riverside,14-Mar-2020,"Effective Date:  March 16, 2020

To:  All UCR Employees

This message is intended for all UCR employees, including but not limited to faculty, staff (non-represented and represented), undergraduate student employees, graduate teaching assistants, and graduate research assistants.

The University has been ordered closed by the Health Officer of the County of Riverside, effective March 16, 2020 through April 3, 2020. Closed in this context means all offices, units or departments will not have staff on campus unless they are essential personnel, and many staff may be working remotely.

We are working with supervisors to define all essential personnel required to support critical campus functions.  Some essential personnel will need to continue to work physically on site. We expect that supervisors will alert all staff regarding our interim plans for Monday.  These plans may well be adjusted as we move further into this closure period. 

All individuals who are not essential personnel will first be asked to work remotely, if feasible. If remote work is not feasible a paid leave option is available, as noted below.

All campus offices, units, or departments will be closed (i.e., no employees physically working on campus), unless they are designated as essential to support critical campus functions.

Please read this entire email carefully and consult with your supervisor, as there are specific situations we are working to provide guidance on for all employees.  We are also working with the University System Office.

The health and well-being of our community remains our number one priority and we believe the most effective communications for individual situations with each employee is through our network of supervisors. 

UC RIVERSIDE GUIDANCE

The following guidance is provided to assist you with planning your work related responsibilities. We recognize that we are operating in a fast moving and fluid environment, but we wanted to get out some key information to everyone as soon as possible after the closure notice from the Heath Officer of the County of Riverside.  It is critical that all employees coordinate with their supervisors to verify work assignments and responsibilities.  We expect we will have to augment this information in the near future:

At this time the University of California has granted use of up to 14 days of paid administrative leave for all employees.  This benefit was put in place before the campus closure by the Health Officer of the County of Riverside and may well be adjusted, but in the near term will provide flexibility for us to use until further guidance is provided.  Those individuals that do not continue to work either on campus as essential personnel, or remotely, may use this benefit to cover their time away from campus. This paid administrative leave is a single allocation of up to 14 work days at the current FTE level, but these days do not need to be consecutive.
 
Essential personnel required to support critical campus functions will need to continue working.  Our goal will be to rotate these staff, to the extent feasible, such that we limit any that remain full-time physically on campus during the full extent of this closure.  Some essential personnel may be able to continue their work remotely.  Some essential personnel may be impacted by illness (them or their family) and/or the closure of day care and schools.  We will work with supervisors to assure we accommodate those situations.  All essential personnel and staff working remotely will be considered on paid work status. Note that all health care workers are designated as essential personnel.   
Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-l9 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not operationally feasible, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence.
 Consult with your supervisor relative to telecommuting is feasible for your duties. To assess whether remote work is operationally feasible, refer to the Assessing the Feasibility of Remote Work during the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak Guidelines. Please note that at this time we are not requiring the telecommuting form to be filled out by the supervisor and employee.
To indicate you are using some of the 14 day paid administrative leave in the UCR Time & Attendance Reporting System (TARS), select other leave and choose the Administrative  Paid (PA) Leave type.
For all staff, TAs and Graduate Research Assistants, the same policy considerations will apply, including the option for up to 14 days of paid administrative leave.  Graduate Research Assistants should consult with their supervisor/PI (who will be carefully coordinating with the appropriate Dean) on their work assignments and also their eligibility for paid administrative leave. We expect there will be some on-campus research work continuing even during this closure. TAs should consult with their supervisor particularly how they can fulfill their role when courses are not being taught in person. UCR will provide more details for TAs prior to the start of Spring quarter. We understand that some TAs and Graduate Assistants may have more than one supervisor, for separate appointments, and therefore they will need to check with each appropriate supervisor.
 For employees who are undergraduate students the same policy considerations apply, including the option of up to 14 work days of paid administrative leave (which do not need to be consecutive). Some undergraduate student employees may have their duties impacted by the campus actions relative to the campus closure and the elimination of in person class meetings, and UCR will work to provide additional guidance for these individuals prior to the start of Spring quarter. For any students schedule to work next week please contact your supervisor for direction.
Benefits  Generally, an employee granted a leave with pay will continue to receive all benefits related to employment.  Special limitations or requirements that apply to certain types of leaves are addressed in the provisions specific to those leaves in PPSM 2.210.III.A.6.
Please accept our thanks for your continued cooperation, patience, and understanding while we adjust and provide guidance to this fluid and unprecedented situation.   

Please anticipate additional email communications and guidance in response to the outbreak and campus closure, as the situation is fast changing . In addition, the UCR COVID-19 Outbreak website will continually be updated.  We anticipate additional communications relative to essential personnel for critical campus functions early next week.   We will also have additional communications to supervisors and staff, specifically prior to the start of the Spring quarter. 

Represented Staff should contact Labor Relations at Labor.Relations@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns.

Staff not covered by a collective bargaining unit should contact Human Resources @ HRPolicy@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns.

 Graduate student employees should contact graddiv@ucr.edu with any questions or concerns.

Riverside,14-Mar-2020,"UPDATE: The closure has been extended to April 30.

Following the Riverside County Public Health order, we are required to minimize the number of people on campus as much as possible while maintaining the critical functions of the university.

Effective Monday, March 16, the UCR campus will be closed, with only critical operations continuing.

There are three important domains for continuing university operations, as outlined below.

1.     Academic Instruction and Student Support

Winter quarter final exams will proceed remotely as planned.

All instruction (including but not limited to labs, studios, and directed studies) will be delivered remotely for the entirety of the spring quarter. This is a change from the April 3 end date for remote instruction. 

On campus housing and residential dining services remain open and residents can elect to remain on campus if needed.

To facilitate remote instruction and learning, ITS is identifying solutions for those instructors, teaching assistants, and students who are in urgent need of laptops and internet access. 

2.     Research Operations

Many research operations are critical campus functions, and those deemed critical will be allowed to continue their work on campus, following important social distancing and hygiene measures. Deans and department chairs will be working with principal investigators to determine critical research functions that must continue on campus, with guidance from the Provost and the Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development.

3.     Health Services

All clinical and health services, including Student Health Services, will continue as critical campus functions. 

Employees will work remotely if feasible, and only essential personnel supporting critical campus functions will be allowed continue their work on campus. 

Deans, chairs, and supervisors will be identifying critical campus functions, and we expect that employees will be updated before Monday.

Moreover, all non-essential domestic and international travel will be suspended, effective Monday, March 16 and until further notice.

Please anticipate additional communications and guidance in response to the outbreak and campus closure, as the situation is rapidly changing. Major campus-wide updates will continue to be posted to the COVID-19 website.

Finally, many of you have heard me say that a university is more than a set of classrooms, buildings, or facilities. At its core, a university is about people. As we work together to confront these unprecedented challenges, I am tremendously grateful to each of you for your continued patience, flexibility, and commitment to UCR.",392,cal,3
Riverside,15-Mar-2020,"Dear UCR Students,

I am writing as a follow-up to Chancellor Wilcoxs email sent on March 14, 2020, regarding the campus closure. As the Chancellor mentioned in his message, our efforts are driven by concern for the publics health and safety. We recognize that this is a disruptive time and appreciate your understanding as we navigate this rapidly evolving situation.

As a reminder, all instruction will be delivered remotely for the entirety of the spring quarter. This is a change from the April 3 end date for remote instruction.

Student Housing and Meal Plans 

Students in all campus housing are strongly encouraged to go to their permanent place of residence if they are able. If you are a financial aid recipient residing in an on-campus residence and decide to leave campus, please notify the financial aid office immediately via financial aids self-service through RWeb. The financial aid office will ensure that all proper expenses are included in your cost of attendance to include an allowance for living at home. 

Campus housing will remain open, and dining services will be provided to those with meal plans.  Students can stay or go home, based on their individual circumstances. If students wish to cancel their housing contracts for spring quarter they need to submit a housing contract cancellation request online at MyHousing. Students will be financially released from their contract if they cancel. If you are a financial aid recipient, your financial aid award status may change.   

Student Life

All events and student activities scheduled on campus are cancelled until further notice.

Student Health Services, Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS), Residential Life, Dining, and RPantry remain available to support students. Students should know that offices will implement procedures to minimize contact, such as providing telehealth services (e.g., Live Health Online) and social distancing measures to minimize in-person contact. We recommend that students visit websites first for information on accessing services.

Please note, RPantry will offer a limited supply of gift cards to the grocery store at Student Health Services, CAPS, and Residential Life.

RPantry can be accessed by appointment only from 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. For further questions or more direct support, please email at rpantry@ucr.edu. To set an appointment at RPantry please visit: https://rpantry.youcanbook.me/.

Please refer to the Keep Learning website for additional online resources. It will be updated accordingly. Computer labs in Watkins 2117 and 2111 and laptop kiosks remain available during finals week.

UCR Commencement 

There has been no decision made about 2020 commencement ceremonies. We advise families not to make arrangements at this time to come to the campus for commencement celebrations pending further guidance from Riverside County Public Health. We are actively looking at alternatives to celebrate our graduates in an appropriate manner. We understand that commencement is an important part of the UCR experience and we want to honor our students while still keeping our community safe. Graduating students should look for a separate message from the UCR Commencement office with details and information in the coming weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break to take course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from personal, non-essential travel (both domestic and international) during spring break.

Thank you for your patience and understanding during these difficult times. Id like to wish everyone a successful finals week and to remember our staff and faculty are here to support you in any way possible.

Please refer to UCRs COVID-19 website for the latest information. ",602,cal,3
Riverside,15-Mar-2020,"The Riverside County Public Health order requires UC Riverside to minimize the number of people on campus while maintaining the critical functions of the university. This is an unprecedented global pandemic with rapidly changing circumstances that require the campus to make all efforts to comply with this public health declaration.

The campus closure is intended to remove UCR employees from the physical campus through April 3 unless they are identified as essential personnel who perform critical functions that can only be conducted on-site. All others will either remote work or, if their jobs cannot be done remotely, are eligible for 14 days of administrative leave, as indicated in yesterdays message.  

For essential personnel supporting critical campus functions on campus, the CDC recommends social distancing measures, which include but are not limited to:

1. Supervisors implementing flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to minimize person-to-person contact.

2. Maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.

This closure also affects campus gatherings and events. All in-person, non-essential gatherings on campus are suspended, until further notice. In addition, Governor Newsom has advised all Californians aged 65 and older to isolate at home.

Employees wishing to briefly return to campus to retrieve materials needed to work remotely must contact their department head/chair for approval in advance. They should also contact their supervisor to secure access to their office if needed.

If this approach is not feasible for some reason, supervisors may contact the Central Plant at 951_827_4677 between the hours of 7:00 a.m.  2:00 p.m. to provide access to offices/labs for personnel to retrieve personal items. After March 17 or after-hours, UCR Police may be contacted at 951_827_5222 for service.

This message contains important updates for both students and faculty taking and administering exams during winter quarter, and planning for remote learning in spring quarter.

Important updates for UCR students

Computer labs in Watkins 2111 and 2117 are open and available for students in need of a computer to take a final exam. The labs will be open from 7:30am - 10:00pm during finals week. 
Laptop kiosks in Orbach library, Rivera library and the HUB (first floor lobby) also are available for students during finals week.
For students without home internet service, several companies have announced plans to offer free internet service to students for 60 days. UCR shared this information via email on March 14 (Remote Network Connectivity Recommendations). 
For students with technology, consider helping a friend in need by sharing your device when you dont need it during finals week.
Remember to check https://keeplearning.ucr.edu for help navigating remote learning environments. This website is being updated regularly. 
Important updates for UCR faculty

Please use only UCR-recommended platforms for administering online exams and hosting materials for remote learning. iLearn (Blackboard) is an approved platform that will satisfy most instructors needs. Other recommendations can be found on the KeepTeaching website. Using these recommended platforms ensures both security and accessibility for our students. 
Remember to check https://keepteaching.ucr.edu for help navigating remote learning environments. The KeepTeaching website adds new information for faculty every day, and there are numerous live webinars this week to help faculty make effective use of Zoom and iLearn. 
Instructional Technology Taskforce

Access to instructional technologies (computers, software, wireless internet, etc.) is critical for remote teaching and learning. UCR staff from ITS, Undergraduate Education (XCITE), the Library, Procurement and other units have been working hard to ensure that UCR faculty and staff have the access they need. Going forward, we are formalizing this group as the Instructional Technology Taskforce and augmenting the membership to include members from the Academic Senate and the Provosts Office. The taskforce will meet daily to address ongoing and evolving needs of UCR students and faculty. Taskforce members already have been identifying equipment that is currently available or that can be acquired on short notice to help lecturers, TAs and students who do not have adequate technology for spring quarter remote instruction. More information about requesting and checking-out equipment for spring quarter is forthcoming. ",391,cal,3

Executive Order
March 16, 2020
Background and Findings
As of this date, the world is facing a severe health crisis in which COVID-19, a new respiratory illness
caused by a novel coronavirus, places millions of people at risk of serious illness or death. The World
Health Organization has declared that the disease is a pandemic.
Declarations of Emergency have been issued by the President of the United States, the Governor of
California, and many California counties and other local jurisdictions, including many of the jurisdictions
where the University of California maintains campuses or other significant operations.
In the United States, where the virus was detected only weeks ago, several thousand people have
already been stricken ill by the disease. The disease is spreading rapidly in our communities and,
accordingly, protecting the capacity of our health care systems is imperative.
Many governmental offices, school districts and universities, and private businesses have suspended inperson operations and/or directed employees to work remotely in an effort to slow the spread of the
disease, and to conserve our limited health resources. The Governor of California has called for bars,
wineries and nightclubs to temporarily cease operation and for restaurants to reduce capacity by 50% in
order to allow for social distancing.
Health officials have placed a limit on mass gatherings and have restricted and/or advised against all
travel except that which is deemed essential.
The University of California holds as its highest priority the health, safety and wellbeing of its students,
faculty, clinicians, administrators and employees, and all other members of its communities.
The University holds as an additional priority the effective functioning of its health systems, which will
serve as critical state assets in the states response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and must be able to
maintain sufficient staffing resources to meet operational needs.
As President of the University, I have concluded that critical steps must be taken to limit the exposure of
members of our community to the disease within our community, to care for those who have fallen ill or
otherwise been exposed, and to assure the continued functioning of critical operations, including most
particularly the health systems that we will rely on to meet the challenge posed by COVID-19.
Executive Order
WHEREFORE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I DECLARE:
On the authority vested in me by Bylaw 30, Bylaw 22.1, Regents Policy 1500 and Standing Order
100.4(ee), and based on the foregoing circumstances, I hereby issue the following order, to be effective
for the period March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and direct the following:
On March 9, 2020, the University authorized a grant of up to 14 days of paid administrative leave for
employees unable to work for COVID-19 related reasons. In order to address the extraordinary
demands placed on our employees in seeking and providing health care for COVID-19, and otherwise
responding to this pandemic, that guidance shall be modified as follows:
_ All employees shall be eligible to receive a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid
administrative leave, subject to the following conditions
o All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire;
o The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including
intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at
the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use
shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in
particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health;
o The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time shall be prorated
according to the percent of the appointment;
o Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the onetime allotment of the paid administrative leave.
o The paid administrative leave hours may only be used for the following purposes:
_ When an employee is unable to work due to the employees own COVID-19-
related illness or that of a family member;
_ When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed
not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site
has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program or is under a
shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to
work remotely;
_ When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or
daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent,
and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in
conjunction with the childcare commitment.
All University policies contrary to the provisions of this Executive Order, except those adopted by the
Regents, shall be suspended to the extent of the conflict, during the period of this Order.
The Vice President  Systemwide Human Resources and the Vice Provost  Academic Personnel and
Programs shall have the authority to issue further guidance about the parameters and use of this paid
administrative leave, in consultation with the Executive Vice President  UC Health.",848,cal,3
Riverside,17-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty Colleagues,

 As you have been hearing on the news and seeing on social media, state and local authorities are closing schools, restaurants and bars, and in the Bay Area ordering people to stay at home.  In a very short period of time here at UCR, we have gone from continue research to the extent possible to substantially limit research to critical activities.    ALL of the research, scholarly and creative activities we do are of immense value to the university mission, but we are quickly moving towards an unprecedented disruption and must now strictly curtail on-campus research activities to those that cannot be postponed or restarted; and prepare for a possible complete shutdown of research on campus.

 Thus, we are revising our directives to faculty PIs and graduate students under their supervision regarding on-site research as follows (i.e., research that cannot be conducted remotely):

 All on-campus research must halt by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17, until and unless granted an exception from the cognizant dean. Deans may authorize specific projects or experiments to proceed if 1) the only place the research activity can be conducted is on campus; and 2) delaying the research activity would seriously undermine the project and have severe consequences for the future of the UCR research enterprise.

Your dean will inform you, if they have not already, of their process for receiving requests to continue research during the shutdown. Please submit your request by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, March 18. Your dean, in consultation with the Interim Provost and VCRED, will take into consideration the consequences of stopping or delaying your research in the larger context of the current pandemic situation and will inform you accordingly. We anticipate that approved exceptions will be rare.
Curtailment of operations is not a reason to take shortcuts, risks, or suspend our usual safety and research compliance protocols. Research will continue to be subject to the same existing compliance regulations.  Moreover, we will all need to be extra vigilant about surface hygiene, social distancing, and general lab safety during this time.
We remind you that in no circumstance should researchers take materials other than secure laptops, data storage devices, and other approved materials offsite (e.g., to their homes) to maintain research continuity during a curtailment.
We will prioritize our future research capacity, including expensive instrumentation and facilities, unrecoverable biological materials, data, and artifacts. This will take precedent over current research that could eventually be restarted.
For those of you working with animals, even if you are allowed to continue current experiments, no new animals should be ordered or new studies initiated if they could be delayed. Keep in mind that supply of PPE may be interrupted soon and for an extended period of time.
No undergraduate students will be allowed in any on-campus labs or research facilities during spring quarter.
Assistant professors whose research is seriously curtailed can apply for stop the clock through their department and the Academic Personnel Office.
 To prepare for the possibility that all research activities may be shut down, PIs of approved research activities are required to submit a shutdown plan by Friday, March 20 at 5pm to their dean. Guidelines  for developing such plan for wet-labs and labs with animals will be distributed soon.

 This is the time to be reflective and creative about our intellectual work, to complete data analysis, and draft manuscripts. We encourage you to write that papers that you have never had time to start and to begin work on your next grant application.  We understand that closing down your lab will be hard, but the extreme conditions of the current pandemic justify it.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation and for all what you continue to do for our University and community. We believe in our faculty, staff, and students and that we will come out of this crisis stronger and more resilient.  There will be many new opportunities that we cannot even imagine about future research and we are committed to help you take advantage of them

Please let us know if you have any questions.",681,cal,3
Riverside,18-Mar-2020,"PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE

The University has modified the special paid administrative leave policies. The initial UCR COVID-19 Staff Guidelines were issued on March 12, 2019, but have been revised in accordance with the Executive Order issued by President Napolitano on March 16th. These new guidelines are attached and include the following key changes:

A single allocation of up to 128 hours (16 days) vs. 112 hours (14 days)
Part-time employees receive paid leave based on their appointment percentage  i.e., 50% employee can receive up to 64 hours of paid administrative leave
Must be used by 12/31/20
Paid administrative leave can be used in hour increments, as well as full day increments, and does not need to be consecutive days.
Given the campus closure there is no need to use other leave accruals before using the paid administrative leave provision
TRACKING PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE IN TARS

The UCR Time and Attendance system (TARS) has been modified to accept new take codes to accommodate the up to 16 days or 128 hours Paid Administrative Leave taken due to the COVID-19 issue. Previous guidance was to select the TARS Administrative - Paid take code for employees on their timesheets. We now determined that the current code was insufficient and did not meet all requirements, therefore a new code have since been modified to specifically address the COVID-19 16 days/128 hours paid administrative leave option granted by the university. The changes to TARS are listed below:

New Admin Codes for Biweekly and Monthly timesheets labeled Administrative  Paid Special
The code is listed under the Sick Leave column for Monthly
The code is listed under the Sick Leave time/leave type dropdown for biweekly
The 16 day (128 hour) balance is reduced whenever there is an entry of one or more hours in one day
Employees should select this option for all days where administrative leave was taken per campus guidance.

Questions regarding the Paid Administrative Leave should be sent to hrpolicy@ucr.edu

Questions or issues regarding TARS & Paid Administrative time entries should be sent to Timesheetfeedback@ucr.edu.",341,cal,3

The Riverside County Public Health Officer has issued a revised public health order, extending the physical closure of the UC Riverside campus for all but the most critical university functions. The closure was originally scheduled to end on April 3, and has now been extended to April 30.

The university will continue with its transition to remote instruction for the entire spring quarter.

Please continue to monitor UCRs COVID-19 website, email, and social media channels for additional updates.

Riverside,19-Mar-2020,"The COVID-19 situation has required continuous response and accommodation, resulting in rapid changes. As such, many campus administrators may not have had the opportunity to ensure staff were prepared to work remotely. ITS is working diligently to provide the technical support required to keep campus operating, however, there are business protocol and decisions that rest solely with individual unit leaders.

Please note that the following must be true in order for a staff member to use the Remote Desktop Connection application to remote into a device on campus:

1.       The campus device must currently be powered ON 

2.       The user must know the name OR IP address of the device

3.       The campus device must be configured to allow Remote Desktop Connection OR the device must operate on a managed desktop (managed by ITS)*

4.       The user must connect to a campus Virtual Private Network (VPN) on their home device

5.        The user must have the Remote Desktop Connection application installed on their home device

If the above criteria are not met, your staff will be unable to remote into their workstation computer and your unit will need to develop your remote work plan accordingly.

*ITS has updated its systems so that all managed desktops are currently configured for Remote Desktop Connection. 

Please also note that staff will not need the ability to remote into a workstation if they have taken their campus laptop or desktop home. In this event, they will need to connect to their home internet and a campus VPN (see instructions above) in order to access secured campus resources, such as files and applications that must be accessed via the UCR network.

Resources to help staff work remotely, including instructions on remote desktop connection and VPN connection, can be found at https://keepworking.ucr.edu/.  

As with all other campus organizations, most ITS employees are working remotely and only a small number of essential personnel remain on-site. As such, ITS does not have the capacity nor means to enter locked buildings and configure devices. We thank you for your understanding and look to unit leaders and administrators to develop a plan of action specific to the needs and circumstances of their staff.

If you require additional technical support for remote work outside of the resources provided on the Keep Working site, please submit a remote work support ticket. Instructions can be found here.

This order is consistent with the measures UC Riverside has taken following the order from the Riverside County Public Health Officer.

We have been working closely with public health officials in recent weeks and as you know, we have made substantial adjustments to campus operations.

We are grateful to the clinicians, health care workers, and counselors who continue to support our communitys needs.

Riverside,20-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

Due to the campus closure, the following interim guidance regarding delivery location is effective through 4/30/2020; all other standard procurement policies still apply. 

Normally, goods purchased by the University should be delivered to Central Receiving located at 3401 Watkins Drive, Riverside, CA 92521. 

In response to the COVID-19 and the campus closure, many UCR employees have been required to work remotely.  Various needs have arisen where low value items must be ordered to facilitate the remote work and delivered to an off-campus location (e.g. the employees home). 

To document these exceptions to policy, please obtain the Department Heads (or designees) approval before requesting items be delivered to a non-University location. 

The approval can be obtained via e-mail and should be retained for audit purposes (e.g. uploaded into eBuy as an attachment to the DAPO attachment, retained with PCard supporting documentation, etc.). 

Departments should ensure appropriate internal controls are in place to track these purchases, their location, and the approval. A copy of the packing slip should be uploaded to the eBuy PO for audit purposes. If purchased with PCard, the packing slip should be retained with other supporting documentation.  

Please note:

If ordering through eCatalog, some suppliers will only ship to the department delivery address on file.   In situations where an alternate delivery address is required, a standard DAPO should be created.
The following university owned items are not permitted to be sent to homes:
Chemicals of any kind
Inventorial Equipment (i.e. items costing $5K including tax)
Lost, stolen, or damaged goods should immediately be reported to your department financial manager.
Please consult with the Vice Chancellor of Research & Economic Development (VCRED) before taking any research materials off- campus (e.g. to homes).
All items delivered to off-campus locations must be returned to regular place of business once the campus closure is lifted.
Receiving Services continues to receive inbound packages and deliveries between 8am to 4pm. Although regular campus delivery service will be modified during the campus closure, critical items and research related items will be delivered to campus departments as needed. Departments are encouraged to cancel/postpone non-essential deliveries to campus during the closure. For additional information, please contact Receiving Services. ",363,cal,3

If you do not have off-campus access to a device and/or internet that supports remote teaching and learning  such as a laptop, desktop, or tablet  we request that you take time now to apply to UCRs Loan2Learn (L2L) Program.

The L2L Program was launched in response to the Universitys transition to remote instruction for the entire spring quarter, in accordance with the revised Riverside County Public Health order. UC Riverside recognizes that the shift to remote learning is more burdensome to some students than others due to the inability to access campus resources, including laptop kiosks and student computer labs. 

We strongly urge you to take advantage of this program while it is available. If you believe you qualify for a complimentary loaner device, please fill out the UCR L2L Application Form (click here).

Riverside,25-Mar-2020,"Dear UCR Students:

We hope you are staying safe and getting needed rest after a challenging end to winter quarter. 

Over the past two weeks, we have collectively transformed the university into a primarily remote working and learning environment. This change has been nothing short of remarkable; and while there will be some bumps along the way, our campus communitys resiliency has helped make this unprecedented change possible. 

Despite our present circumstances, UCR will not be taking any shortcuts with the change to remote instruction: the same standards that define UCRs excellence will continue during these challenging times, and all of us remain focused on your continued academic progress. Your faculty is working around the clock to prepare and adjust spring quarter courses, while remaining committed to their groundbreaking research activities. In fact, several faculty members and students in the School of Medicine and across the university are on the frontlines treating patients and advancing research in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

We recognize that you have many questions and concerns as you head into the spring quarter, and we hope to address many of them below.

Tuition and Fees

We have been asked if spring quarter tuition and fees will be adjusted, so we write to clarify the University of Californias approach. Consistent with this letter issued by the UC Office of the President, all tuition and fees remain unchanged for students enrolled during spring quarter. 

We recognize there are continued concerns about campus-based fees during this period of uncertainty. While the current situation is unprecedented, students enrolled in off-campus instructional programs such as the Education Abroad Program or UCDC, for example, are assessed campus-based fees even if they are not physically present on the campus. Thus, remote instruction is determined to be analogous to those off-campus arrangements.

Separate from the tuition and fees described above, UCR is reviewing course materials and services fees to determine if these can be waived for the spring quarter. We plan to finalize those decisions next week so student billing can be appropriately adjusted.

Faculty and Teaching Assistants

Faculty members and TAs will hold virtual office hours and implement a range of approaches that foster communication and promote opportunities for student/faculty collaboration that are the heart of the academy. While the classroom experience will be different this spring, your instructors will prioritize academic enrichment; meaningful interaction, connections, and mentorship; and a strong focus on academic rigor. Additionally, academic support services such as tutoring and supplemental instruction will remain available through the spring quarter.

Laboratories and Performance-Based Courses

Developing remote laboratories and performance-based courses is a significant challenge, and faculty members are working with campus experts to satisfy learning objectives. We are consulting with peer universities across the nation to apply best practices in planning remote labs and courses. Each course will develop the academic and technical skills necessary for the growth and development of our students. 

Instructional Quality 

We are making substantial new investments in technology and other tools to support remote learning at a scale never seen before at UC and to ensure that the courses you take in spring quarter will achieve their learning objectives, as they would in any other quarter. The same UCR faculty, lecturers and teaching assistants who deliver in-person instruction will evaluate your work in spring 2020. 

On-Campus Housing and Other Services

Consistent with state and county public health orders, we strongly encourage students to return home, if it is safe to do so. We understand that some of you must remain on campus for various reasons. You are welcome to stay and we will continue to provide services in a modified manner to protect healthy and safety.

Student Health, Counseling and Psychological Services, RPantry, and other functions remain available for all students even through the closure.

Financial Aid

The Office of Financial Aid remains committed to supporting you during the spring quarter. The office will continue its operations remotely and is available to serve students by email. If you make any changes to your course schedule or living arrangements, you may submit a revision request in RWeb for your spring financial aid package to be adjusted accordingly.

Finally, we will continue to monitor conditions to ensure that every student has the ability to persist under these challenging and unprecedented circumstances, and we will share further adjustments as information becomes available.

Riverside,26-Mar-2020,"Dear UCR Student,

As we continue to navigate the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges each of you might be feeling at this time, UCR will be implementing additional changes to the spring 2020 late payment penalties and additional fees. Please read the following carefully:
$100 Late Payment Fee will not be assessed to any student for spring 2020.
Students utilizing the Deferred Payment Plan (DPP) will not be charged a late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).
Students with non-tuition and housing charges (i.e. parking, library, etc.) will not be charged the Student Business Services late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).
Students in housing will not be charged a housing payment late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).
Students in housing will not be charged the spring 2020 housing activity fee.
New registration holds for delinquent accounts will not be placed until April 16, 2020. Students with outstanding charges for the Spring 2020 quarter only will be able to make registration adjustments for spring 2020 through the end of drop/add via self-service. Delinquent Holds for outstanding charges from a previous quarter will remain in place.
Course material fees will be adjusted for courses that, in this new learning environment, do not require the equipment or other educational resources traditionally covered by the fee. Of the approximately 280 course material fees typically assessed, 8 courses will retain these fees because the educational resources will still be provided to support the student-learning experience. Please allow the first week of instruction for these adjustments to be made to your student account. The Registrars website will be updated to reflect which course material fees remain in effect for spring.
All changes are in effect for spring 2020 only.

For guidance on tuition and fees beyond those listed above, please reference the communication released March 25, 2020, to all students.


If you find you are in a position that you cannot continue attendance for spring 2020, please ensure to follow standard graduate and undergraduate cancellation and withdrawal procedures, which can be found on the respective websites:
Graduate students, please reference the Graduate Divisions website.
Undergraduate students, please reference the Registrars website.

Riverside,31-Mar-2020,"Dear Highlanders,

As many of you know, registration for UCR Summer Sessions begins on April 1. Normally UCR hosts around 600 in-person classes during multiple sessions that run from June to September, helping to make our campus a vibrant place to be in summer.

This year, campuses like ours are facing the risk and uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 crisis  including the possibility that we will be unable to return to in-person instruction for summer. With registration now upon us, and being aware of the advanced planning that both faculty and students must make to participate in summer session classes, UCR and other UC campuses must decide now whether to continue remote instruction into summer.

After consulting with campus leadership, including the Chair and Vice Chair of the Academic Senate, and checking in with colleagues at other UC campuses, we have decided to continue remote instruction through summer 2020. 

Making this decision now will enable students to register for classes with the knowledge they need to make related plans for summer, including residential and employment decisions, and will give faculty substantial lead time to plan for remote instruction. We believe this is the best way to support our students after spring quarter, especially those whose progress to degree may be affected by their ability to access summer courses.

Summer Sessions will be working with the academic departments during the next week to update the summer schedule of classes to accommodate remote instruction. ",242,cal,3

On Saturday, April 4, 2020 Riverside County health officials issued
an order requiring that all persons wear fabric face coverings
(without holes) to cover their nose and mouth in public places
(indoor and outdoor) to help prevent Coronavirus (COVID-19)
transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
issued similar guidance.
The face covering does not have to be hospital grade. Acceptable
examples include bandanas, fabric masks, and neck gaiters, also
known as neck warmers. The county is discouraging N-95
respirators and surgical masks for non-medical reasons.
Face Coverings
Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) placed an order of
bandanas for limited distribution to employees working on
campus. The expected delivery date is Monday, April 6, 2020.
The bandanas are white 22 x 22 inches, and 100% cotton cloth
fabric. The coverings may help reduce exposure to droplets in
the air that contain the COVID-19 virus. Bandanas will be
available on a first-come, first-served basis. For more information
about face coverings, refer to California Department of Public
Health guidance.
The campus has initiated other activities to get face coverings,
including use of the Theatre departments Costume Shop to
produce masks, and acquisition of materials by UCPD and Dining
Services. The University has several other initiatives to be examined in efforts to comply with this very recent and fast changing
requirement.
Distribution
DEPARTMENTS
EH&S will work with unit heads from departments with essential functions including Police, Facilities Services, Housing, Dining, Student
Affairs, and others to determine the number of covers needed and will coordinate distribution to those units first. A maximum of two
face coverings per person will be instituted.
INDIVIDUALS
If you would like to obtain a bandana, but are not from a department that EH&S is working with, complete the form
https://tinyurl.com/ug65je4. An email confirmation will be sent if supplies are available. Bandanas may be picked up on Tuesdays and

Riverside,6-Apr-2020,"Dear UCR Faculty, Students, and Staff,

 UC Riverside is moving into uncharted territory as we begin our first-ever Spring quarter with all remote instruction. Your UCR Library staff have been working diligently to provide support, services, and remote access to resources, which are outlined in this new LibGuide on Expanded / Free Access during the COVID-19 closure.

 Additionally, UCR affiliates can access electronic copies of most library materials from off-campus locations through the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service.

 The Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS) permits special access for HathiTrust member libraries located in the U.S. that suffer an unexpected or involuntary, temporary disruption to normal operations, such as closure for a public health emergency, requiring the library to be closed to its patrons, or otherwise restrict print collection access services.

 The service makes it possible for member library patrons to obtain lawful access to specific digital materials in HathiTrust that correspond to physical books held by their own library. The Emergency Temporary Access Service will enable many HathiTrust member libraries to continue supporting the teaching, learning, and research mission of their institutions during said disruption in service.

Through the HathisTrust ETAS, UCR faculty, staff, and students now have:

What are the campus's guidelines for face coverings?

On April 4, 2020, Riverside County Health issued an order requiring that all people wear fabric face coverings to cover their nose and mouth in public places, both indoors and outdoors. The campus has ordered all-cotton bandanas for limited distribution to employees working on campus. These bandanas are not hospital-grade face coverings, but rather will help reduce exposure to droplets in the air that contain the COVID-19 virus. For more information, including on how to obtain a face covering and properly wear it, visit https://ehs.ucr.edu/document/face-covering-requirement. ",432,cal,4
Riverside,7-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues:
Throughout UC hospitals, clinics and health centers, the continued safety of our employees and patients is
our paramount priority.
The following guidance applies to UC health care personnel (HCP) - defined as all paid and unpaid
personnel at UC medical centers, clinics, student health and counseling centers who have the potential for
exposure to patients and/or infectious materials.
1. To better protect employees and patients, HCP who test positive for COVID-19 at an outside facility (e.g.,
Kaiser) are required to immediately self-report the positive COVID-19 test result to their locations
Occupational Health program. This information must be kept separate from employees personnel files.
The information may be used exclusively to perform contact tracing or other activities as directed by
Occupational Health or Infection Prevention teams to address employee and patient safety; and to perform
other permissible health care operations.
2. UC Health will follow the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) non-test-based strategy to
determine when HCP with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work in a healthcare setting.
HCP working in high risk patient care areas (e.g., transplant, cancer) may be subject to additional criteria
before returning to work in those settings. HCP should check with their local Occupational Health for
additional details on specific work practices (including self-monitoring) and/or work restrictions.
As situations evolve, we will update this guidance as needed. ",227,cal,4
Riverside,14-Apr-2020,"In an ongoing effort to adhere to the Riverside County request for social distancing with essential workers on-campus, Facilities Services (FS) continues to have limited staff on-campus. Below is an overview of current maintenance-focused services during the campus closure. 

Campus Custodial Services: Custodial services are limited to cleaning/sanitizing restrooms and common areas within the buildings reported to campus leadership as currently supporting essential business on campus. Services can range between 1 to 3 times per week based on the number of essential individuals identified by organizations within each building. To see the list of buildings on the Campus Custodial cleaning list, click here. Custodial Services continues to use a chemical disinfectant recommended by Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) and is on the official Centers for Disease Control (CDC) approved list of products. 

Limited Campus Custodial & Refuse Services: Trash in offices and most building common areas will not be picked up. All essential workers in occupied buildings will need to dispose of all food refuse and other materials by utilizing the building dumpsters at the end of their day. We ask that all dumpster lids are closed after use. Campus landfill dumpsters are emptied every Tuesday and Thursday and recycling dumpsters are checked or emptied every Wednesday. 

Landscape Services: Services are limited to mowing on-campus grounds every other week. Housing location are mowed on alternate weeks (weather permitting). Emergency weather-related debris removal also continues to be supported. 

Minor Renovation Project Work Halted: All minor renovation projects remain on hold during the campus closure, currently through June 19, 2020. As campus prepares for reopening, previously prioritized minor renovation projects and projects currently in process will be assessed for next steps. Additional information related to minor renovation projects will be communicated by Facilities Services upon return to normal business operations. 

Contact Information for Facilities Services
    Service requests for maintenance concerns must be submitted by visiting us at facilities.ucr.edu/requests. Please do not request service by emailing shop supervisors or FS leadership directly as this is delaying service support - this includes concerns in essential research locations. Administrative staff is working remotely to support all incoming issues via our work order and email system.
    For general inquiries about Facilities Services or work orders, please email facilities@ucr.edu. Administrative staff continues to work remotely Monday-Friday and will respond to all inquiries.

Riverside,16-Apr-2020,"Dear Campus Community:
 
First, Id like to offer a sincere thank you for all youre doing and for your patience as we work through the myriad of issues that are confronting the university at this unprecedented time.  We hope that this guidance on staffing is final and complete at this time, and at least will provide a clear direction through June 30, 2020.

5.       A current career staff employee not able to work remotely and not able to be assigned any specific duties on campus may be eligible for pay continuation through June 30, 2020, if they satisfy all of the necessary requirements listed below:

Riverside,21-Apr-2020,"Dear UCR Community,
 
As announced on April 3, 2020, I asked the Commencement Working Group to convene and discuss our existing plans for this years graduation activities in light of Riverside Countys extended school closure order. Last week the Working Group submitted to me three recommendations that apply to all graduates except those in the School of Medicine, which will have an online graduation ceremony on May 29th:
 
1.    Postpone in-person Commencement 2020 events until it is safe to reschedule them.
2.    Hold online June 2020 celebrations.
3.    Communicate approved recommendations to students and their families in a timely manner (approximately 3 months for the in-person ceremonies when rescheduled) so that they can plan accordingly.
 
Honoring the spirit of the third recommendation, I write to announce that in-person commencement ceremonies previously scheduled for May and June of this year are being postponed until they can be safely rescheduled. We will continue to follow guidelines established by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and abide by orders from California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Riverside County Public Health Officer.
 
Student leaders on the Working Group engaged with their respective undergraduate and graduate constituencies to discuss their hopes and goals for the online celebrations: recognizing their accomplishments, creating a sense of community, and enabling graduates to acknowledge those who supported their success.
 
The creative staff members who organize commencement each year are evaluating technology platforms that will meet those criteria, and details will be announced soon. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to more than 3,000 students, faculty and staff who made their voices heard through the Working Groups survey.
 
I thank Working Group co-chairs Vice Chancellor Brian Haynes and Dean Kathryn Uhrich, and the students, faculty, staff, and administrators who ensured that this important decision was informed by thoughtful conversation and sound data.
 
I look forward to the point where we can welcome our community back to campus, where the quiet and solitude belie the energy of a typical spring quarter filled with excitement for completing yet another academic year. Please stay healthy and take care of yourself and those you love.",353,cal,4

 On March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which created two new emergency paid leave
requirements  the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA) and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act
(EFMLEA)  was signed into law by President Trump.

 On April 2, 2020, President Napolitano and the ten Chancellors issued a job protections letter indicating that there
would no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020.
 On April 17, 2020, the UC Employee Request for EPSL/EFML forms were issued.
C. Frequently Asked Questions
April 2, 2020 Job Protections Letter
1. Does the April 2, 2020 letter from President Napolitano and the Chancellors regarding job protections apply to all UC
staff, or are there exceptions?
This applies to all current career staff employees. Career staff employees are defined as working a fixed or variable
percentage of time at 50 percent or more of full-time, and the position is expected to continue for a year or more. This
does not apply to the following types of staff positions: Casual/Restricted, Contract, Floater, Limited, and Per Diem
employees. Academic appointees should refer to the APP Guidance Regarding COVID-19 Related Leaves and Job
Protections.
2. Does this letter apply to student employees in staff positions?
This applies to student employees in career staff positions. Students on work study will continue to receive financial aid
during this time, and campuses will do all they can to find work study jobs for these students. Students employed in
academic positions should refer to the APP Guidance Regarding COVID-19 Related Leaves and Job Protections
3. What does this letter mean if employees are unable to work?
Employees are expected to work to the fullest extent they can, whether working on-site or remotely in healthcare or
other critical and essential operations. If employees are unable to work remotely, they must talk to their supervisor to
determine if they can be redeployed to another assignment they are capable of doing. If employees are unable to work,
either because of illness or the need to care for others, they should talk with their supervisor for information regarding
appropriate leave options. Employees can also be reassigned in accordance with applicable PPSM and CBAs. If an
employee refuses to work when work is available, the supervisor should consult with their local Human Resources.
4. Does this letter provide for pay continuation for staff employees through June 30, 2020? (Revised 5/4/20)
In some circumstances, yes. Under this letter, a staff employee may be eligible for pay continuation through June 30,
2020 if they satisfy all of the necessary requirements listed below.
i. The employee must be a current career staff employee.
ii. Because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other University-related disruptions (e.g. cancellation of a
series of concert events on a UC campus) due to COVID-19, the employee must not be able to work on site or
remotely in any capacity.
iii. The employee must have used all of the applicable COVID-19-related paid leave options that may have been
available to the employee (i.e., UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave, EPSL, and EFML).
iv. After the employee satisfies the third requirement above, that employee must use 40 hours of their accrued
vacation leave and/or similar leave accruals, such as PTO or CTO, but not accrued sick leave. If the employee
has fewer than 40 hours remaining of such leave accruals, the employee must use their remaining leave
accruals. If the employee has used all such leave accruals, the employee may be eligible for pay continuation.
 1 This guidance does not apply to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory employees. Berkeley Lab employees with questions should refer to Berkeley Labs COVID-19 website or
status.lbl.gov
Page 3 of 6
Employees will not be eligible for pay continuation under this question 4 if they do not satisfy all of the necessary
requirements above. (Please see question 5 for employees who have been advised to self-quarantine due to concerns
related to COVID-19.)
In some situations, pay continuation may end sooner than June 30, 2020. These are generally situations related to the
normal course of business. For example:
 Employees with appointments that expire before June 30 will be subject to the current terms and conditions of
their appointments.
 Employees on research contracts or grants will be subject to the current terms and conditions of their
appointments if the contract or grant funding expires or is depleted before June 30, 2020.
 There may be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of the Universitys typical career employee
summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments. For example, if an employees work hours or pay are
typically seasonally adjusted before June 30, 2020, those adjustments will still occur.
5. If an employee has been advised to self-quarantine by their health care provider due to concerns related to COVID19, is the employee eligible for pay continuation? (Added 5/4/20)
The University understands there may be situations where an employees health care provider has advised the
employee to self-quarantine because (a) the employee has COVID-19 or may have COVID-19; or (b) the employee is
particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. If such employees cannot work remotely (either because it is not operationally
feasible or because their health care provider has advised against it) , the employee may be eligible for pay continuation
if requirements i, iii, and iv in question 4 above are satisfied, even if requirement ii is not met. To request pay
continuation in a situation like this, the employee should contact their supervisor. Locations should request that the
employee provide documentation from their health care provider confirming that the health care provider has advised
the employee to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19. If the health care provider has advised against
working remotely, the documentation should state that.
General
6. Who is considered a health care worker? What leaves do health care workers have available? (Added 4/27/20)
A health care worker is a health care provider as defined by the FCCRA implementing regulations: For the purposes
of this definition Employees who may be exempted from Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave by their

clinic, post-secondary educational institution offering health care instruction, medical school, local health department or
agency, nursing facility, retirement facility, nursing home, home health care provider, any facility that performs
laboratory or medical testing, pharmacy, or any similar institution, Employer, or entity. This includes any permanent or
temporary institution, facility, location, or site where medical services are provided that are similar to such institutions.
Although employers may exempt health care workers from taking both EPSL and EFML, following extensive consultation
with UC health center and campus leadership, health care workers at UC are eligible to take EPSL for Reasons 1, 2, and
3. The following health care workers at UC are not eligible to take EPSL for Reasons 4 or 5 and are not eligible to take
EFML: everyone employed at an entire medical center and the related health professional schools, student health
centers, and counseling and psychological services. This includes schools of dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, and the UCLA
school of public health.
Health care workers are still able to access other leaves that they may be eligible for including UC Expanded Paid
Administrative Leave, vacation and sick leave, PTO, and CTO, and career health care workers are covered by the April 2,
2020 letter from President Napolitano and the Chancellors regarding job protections.
7. Will UC health benefits continue for employees on any of these paid leaves?
Yes, employees will continue to have any existing health benefits while on paid leave. 
Page 4 of 6
8. If an employee is or gets sick, from COVID-19, will the employee be required to use their accrued sick or vacation
leave, paid time off, or other paid medical leave? What if the employee doesnt have enough accrued sick or vacation
leave Ñ will they still receive their full pay?
Employees who are unable to work due to their own illness or because they must care for an ill family member may
have several different leave options available, including Family and Medical Leave (FMLA/CFRA), sick leave, vacation
leave and PTO (paid time off).
Depending upon circumstances, an employee may qualify for EPSL or UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave. If an
employee does not have enough accrued sick or vacation leave available, they should work with their supervisor about
the situation and to accurately record non-work time.

UCRP, as they normally would while on pay status.
10. What are appropriate leave options?
Standard leave options may include Family and Medical Leave (FMLA/CFRA), sick leave, vacation leave, and paid time off
(PTO). Depending upon the circumstances, an employee may qualify for special COVID-19 leaves (see table above
regarding COVID-19-related leave).
11. Can a department or supervisor ask if an employee foresees COVID-19 related childcare issues that will preclude
them from working?
Yes, as a planning tool, departments or supervisors can inquire if leave for COVID-related childcare is anticipated. It is
best if such inquiries be made of everyone in the department or team so as not to single out individuals.
12. Will COVID-19 related leaves need to be tracked?
Yes. The University is tracking and reporting the amount of COVID-19 leave taken and the associated payroll expense.
The UCPath Center is working on mechanisms to track the type of leaves taken, including the Reason. Not all entry and
calculations will be automated in UCPath or PPS  locations will need to process some manual entry and upload of
leaves.
13. Where can I find additional University resources/information regarding COVID-19?
The University has developed a COVID-19 website with updates and information on all things COVID-19. The website
also includes links to locations COVID-19 sites as well as to the CDC and WHO sites.
UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave
14. Will an employee need to use UCs Expanded Paid Administrative Leave or the new federal COVID-19- related leaves
during this time period if they are unable to work for COVID-19-related reasons?
Employees can choose the order in which they use UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave, EPSL, EFML, and any other
paid leave accruals.
15. An exempt employee who does not accrue vacation or sick leave has requested to take UC Paid Administrative Leave
(PAL) because they are unable to work due to their own COVID-19 related illness (Criterion 1). Is the employee
eligible to take PAL? (Added 4/27/20)

essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health;
 The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time shall be prorated according to the percent of
the appointment; 
Page 5 of 6

FFCRA Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL) & Expanded Family and Medical Leave (EFML)
16. Who is eligible for leave under the EPSL and EFML?
All employees are eligible for EPSL, regardless of their length of employment at the University or appointment type.

With the exception of health care workers and emergency responders, employees of any appointment type who have
been on UCs payroll for the 30 calendar days immediately prior to the day their leave would begin are eligible for EFML.
17. Does EPSL/EFML need to be taken in one continuous block of time or can it be used intermittently? (Revised 5/15/20)
EPSL must be taken in blocks. Locations have the discretion to define block when teleworking employees use EPSL for
Reason 1-6 and when employees working onsite use EPSL for Reason 5. The FFCRA regulations do not allow employees
working onsite to use EPSL intermittently if EPSL is being taken for Reasons 1-4 or 6. In those circumstances, the
employee must continue using EPSL in full-day increments until the employee either uses the full amount of EPSL or no
longer has a qualifying reason for using EPSL.
EFML must be taken in blocks of a minimum of two weeks.
18. Will employees be asked to complete a form to request EPSL or EFML provided under FFCRA? (Revised 4/27/20)
Yes, employees will be asked to complete the UC Employee Request for EPSL and/or EFML form to provide pertinent
information regarding eligibility for EPSL and/or EFML and to certify that the information provided is correct.
19. Will an employee qualify for EPSL or EFML even if they have already used some or all of their leave entitlement under
the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) during 2020?
An eligible employee is entitled to EPSL under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act regardless of how much leave they
have taken under the FMLA.
However, the employees eligibility for EFML depends on how much leave the employee has already taken during 2020
for FMLA leave. An employee may take a total of 12 workweeks for FMLA or EFML reasons during 2020. If the employee
has taken some, but not all, of their 12 workweeks of leave under FMLA during 2020, the employee may take the
remaining portion of leave available as EFML. If the employee has already taken 12 workweeks of FMLA leave during
2020, the employee may not take EFML.
For example, assume an employee was eligible for preexisting FMLA leave and took two workweeks of such leave in
January 2020 to undergo and recover from a surgical procedure. The employee therefore has 10 workweeks of FMLA
leave remaining. Because EFML is a type of FMLA leave, the employee would be entitled to take up to 10 workweeks of
EFML, rather than 12 workweeks. And, any EFML the employee takes would count against their entitlement to
preexisting FMLA leave, but not against their leave entitlement under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA).
20. When can an employee who has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to
COVID-19 (Reason 2) elect EPSL? (Added 4/27/20)
The implementation guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Labor provide that to be eligible for EPSL in this
situation the advice to self-quarantine must be based on the health care providers belief that the employee has COVID19, may have COVID-19, or is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. And self-quarantining must prevent the employee
from working. An employee who is self-quarantining is able to telework, and therefore may not take paid sick leave for
this reason, if (a) his or her employer has work for the employee to perform; (b) the employer permits the employee to
perform that work from the location where the employee is self-quarantining; and (c) there are no extenuating
circumstances, such as serious COVID-19 symptoms, that prevent the employee from performing that work.
21. If an exempt employee is unable to work as they are caring for an individual subject to quarantine/isolation order
(Reason 4), is the employee eligible for EPSL? (Added 4/27/20) 
Page 6 of 6
Yes the employee would be eligible for EPSL. The implementation guidelines issued by the U.S Department of Labor
provide that this qualifying reason applies only if but for a need to care for an individual, the employee would be able to
perform work for his or her employerÉ. Furthermore, the employee must have a genuine need to care for the individual.
Accordingly, the employee will need to identify the individual for whom care is being provided and their relationship to
that individual.
22. An employee has requested paid leave (i.e., UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave, EPSL and/or EFML) because they
are unable to telework due to a lack of childcare as a result of COVID-19. How can I determine whether the employee
is eligible for paid leave and which leave they are eligible for? (Added 4/27/20)
An employee who is unable to work or telework because they are caring for their child whose school or place of care has
closed (or whose child care provider is unavailable) due to COVID-19 reasons is eligible to take UC Expanded Paid
Administrative Leave, EPSL (Reason 5) and/or EFML (assuming they meet the 30 days service requirement). To be
eligible for EPSL and/or EFML for this purpose, the employee must confirm that there is no other suitable person to care
for their child during the period for which the employee is requesting paid leave. If their child is older than 14 and the
employee will be caring for the child during daylight hours, the employee will need to explain the special circumstances
that make it necessary for the employee to provide care to that child during that period. If the child is 18 years or older,
the child must be incapable of self-care due to a mental or physical disability. Health care workers and emergency
responders are not eligible to take EPSL for this reason or to take EFML. The use of UC Expanded Paid Administrative
Leave must not adversely affect the delivery of essential University services, which includes the clinical services
delivered by UC Health.
An employee who has already utilized leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) this calendar year, will have
their EFML entitlement reduced by their FMLA use.
Similarly, any EFML use will count against an appointees total 2020 FMLA entitlement. The first two workweeks of
EFML are unpaid. However, the employee may receive pay during these two workweeks by electing to use their EPSL
entitlement for Reason 5 during this period. Alternatively, the employee may elect to use any other paid leave option
available to the employee, such as UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave or accrued paid leave (such as vacation or
PTO) that an employee may use to take care of a child when the childs school is closed or their child care provider is
unavailable. If an employee utilizes other paid leave accruals during the first two workweeks of EFML that would
otherwise be unpaid, such use would run concurrently with the employees EFML entitlement.
23. Can an employee receive pay during the first two workweeks of EFML?
The first two workweeks of EFML are unpaid, but the employee may receive pay during these two workweeks by
electing to use their EPSL entitlement for Reason 5 during this period. Alternatively, the employee may elect to use any
other paid leave options available to the employee, such as UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave or accrued paid
leave (such as vacation or PTO) that an employee may use to take care of a child when the childs school is closed or
their child care provider is unavailable.
24. Can an employee take 80 hours of EPSL for their own self-quarantine and then another amount of EPSL for another
reason provided under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act?
No. The total number of hours for which an employee can take EPSL is capped at 80 hours for full-time employees and
the two-week equivalent for part-time employees.
25. If an employee doesnt use all of their UC Expanded Paid Administrative Leave, EPSL and/or EFML entitlements in
2020, can they use those entitlements 2021?
No. Those entitlements must be used by December 31, 2020.",3999,cal,4

Riverside,4-May-2020,"The effects of the campus closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in decreased workloads for staff and students in many campus units. Human Resources has developed UCRs Talent Match Program to pair staff and students with diminished workloads with temporary job assignments. Specifically, the program strives to identify reassignment opportunities for UCR staff and current student employees from areas where operations have scaled-down, in other departments that have a need for additional staff/student capacity.
 
Participation is voluntary; however, employees and campus departments are encouraged to take advantage of this program to the fullest extent possible, to keep our valuable staff/student resources working in support of the Universitys mission, during this unprecedented time.
 
There are two options available:
1.    Departments may submit & post a temporary job assignment that is available in their department.
2.    Staff and current student employees with diminished workloads may submit an availability and interest form to be considered for a temporary job assignment.

Riverside,9-May-2020,"Dear Campus Community: 

On Friday, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors asked the Public Health officer to rescind the order mandating the closure of universities in the county.

This action will not result in any immediate changes to UC Riversides campus operations or our plans for remote instruction this spring and summer. These actions essentially move us under the State of California requirements.

Governor Gavin Newsoms stay-at-home order remains in place until further notice. We will continue to ask employees who are currently working on campus to wear face coverings and to practice physical distancing to the maximum extent possible.

UCR leaders are meeting with Riverside County health officials to help inform our planning for future adjustments to campus operations, and we will update the campus as more details become available. ",131,cal,5
Santa Barbara,14-May-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

It is hard to believe that two months have passed since we made the initial decision to transition to remote instruction for our spring quarter, ramped down our research endeavors, and asked staff and faculty to work and teach from home. By working together, applying our creativity and adaptability, and making sacrifices, we have achieved a number of successes under these extraordinarily challenging circumstances. We have continued to uphold the excellence of a UC Santa Barbara education, and conducted limited but life-saving research. Most notably, our collective efforts to stay at home and practice social distancing have helped reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and protected countless lives.

In responding to what has become the most significant public health crisis of our time, our UC Santa Barbara community has shown tremendous compassion, ingenuity, and self-sacrifice. The abrupt changes have also come at a cost – from significant disappointments to great personal loss. We will face many more challenges in the months ahead, but our strength and resilience will come from our support for one another.

Our Path Forward – Planning for Campus Research and Instruction
We are undertaking extensive planning for a measured and phased return of our campus research operations, and, looking further ahead, to a carefully managed, phased return of staff to campus and resumption of on-campus instruction. We are consulting with our administrative and Academic Senate colleagues, faculty, researchers, staff, and students to help us understand our community’s needs, and we have also received important feedback from alumni, parents, Trustees, and friends. Our deans and administrative colleagues have been working with faculty in every department to prepare for and explore all options for fall quarter.

Given the inherent uncertainties the State and our country are still facing, we are planning for a range of scenarios for our research, instruction, and operations.

We have heard from our parents and students about how important the campus experience is, and we are planning for scenarios that allow some in-person instruction on campus, but still require varying levels of remote instruction, even for students in residence on campus. These hybrid scenarios will be guided by limits and restrictions imposed by public health authorities and by the recommendations of our local and campus health experts, as well as input from other members of our community.
We are also preparing for the possibility that our campus may be allowed to largely return to normal instruction. This is our ultimate hope and goal, but the timeline is uncertain, with current guidance indicating such a possibility is unlikely for the fall quarter. Even if we are able to resume most campus activities, we are committed to offering a full curriculum and to accommodating students who may need remote access.
If public health requirements and safety concerns prevent us from resuming in-person instruction, our campus is preparing for the possibility of continuing with full remote instruction for the fall quarter, ramping up some approved on-campus research, and operating predominantly with a remote workforce.
Our Office of Research is planning for a ramp-up of campus research starting as early as June, and held a town hall to discuss how to safely resume research in stages as conditions allow. Our Library is developing scenarios that would allow access for faculty and graduate student researchers, and eventually for a limited number of undergraduates, in coordination with the resumption of instruction in the fall.

We are also working on plans for our campus working environment that reduce density and allow for physical distancing in office and workplace settings. Our staff – who, along with our faculty, have worked from home in improvised conditions, often while taking on childcare and homeschooling responsibilities – make our teaching, counseling, and research possible, with uncompromising quality, and care for our buildings and beautiful campus. They are crucial to our ongoing operations, and to a gradual resumption of our in-person campus activities.

We are meeting daily with our colleagues from every UC campus, at every administrative level including chancellors and our UC President, to exchange information and share expertise. Additionally, we are working closely with state and local officials as they determine policy directives that will affect our future decisions and actions. Our goal is to make key decisions on fall operations in June.

Testing and Surveillance Planning
While we are eager to have our university life return to normal, the health and safety of our campus and regional communities are our highest priority and guide every decision we make. In the absence of proven medical interventions and treatments, we will need to rely on comprehensive testing, contact tracing, health monitoring, and quarantine protocols as we ramp up research, welcome students back to our residence halls, and start in-person instruction when we can safely do so. Our administrative colleagues, staff, faculty, and researchers have been working tirelessly to develop these plans. This approach is in line with California Governor Gavin Newsom’s reopening plans and UC systemwide guidelines.

Many of our faculty members and researchers have put aside their current research projects and redirected their efforts to address the COVID-19 crisis. One of the many projects may have a significant impact on our campus planning efforts. A team of campus researchers has been developing a fast and practical COVID-19 test that can be deployed in the field. The approach shows great promise, and an initial research program was recently approved by an external Institutional Review Board. Our researchers are working closely with our administrative colleagues and campus health experts to implement testing in a research-oriented launch over the summer. In anticipation of its success, we are also working in coordination with our local public health office to build the infrastructure capable of testing all symptomatic campus community members, as well as methodically testing a sample of individuals on campus, independent of symptoms. We have launched a fundraising campaign to support our testing program.

Physical Distancing and Face Coverings
Physical distancing will continue to play a critical role in mitigating the spread of the virus until proven medical interventions are developed. As such, we are in the process of a comprehensive review to evaluate how our students can safely be housed in existing campus residences, including quarantine spaces to isolate any students who are diagnosed with or exposed to COVID-19. We are looking closely at how physical distancing requirements will affect classroom, housing, dining hall, library, office, and laboratory settings, and everywhere on campus. We are also assessing our capacity to provide the frequent and thorough cleaning services that will be required to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19.  

Thanks to generous gifts from our donors, our campus has acquired and distributed cloth face coverings for most of the faculty and staff currently providing essential services on campus. Associated Students and the Graduate Student Association also have obtained face coverings for students who remain on campus. If we are eventually able to return to in-person instruction, we will find ways to supply face coverings to our entire campus population.

We have and will continue to carry forward our strong commitment to public health and safety for our students, faculty, staff, and campus community.

Support for Our Undergraduate and Graduate Students
Our undergraduate and graduate students are the reason we are all here. To support our undergraduate students who qualify for financial aid and our graduate students who need additional support, we are distributing $12.5 million in additional financial aid that was made available through the federal CARES Act. We are committed to raising additional resources to support our students, faculty, and staff through philanthropy and by working with state and federal officials.

Despite the significant amount of work and research we have already undertaken in a relatively short period of time, there is still much we do not know, and likely will not know for some time. We wish we could offer more definite timelines and information. The uncertainty surrounding the coming academic year is a source of anxiety and stress for all of us, and we deeply regret that we don’t have precise answers at this time. We will keep our community informed of our planning efforts throughout the process, and will announce decisions as they are consulted and finalized.

We are committed to providing our students with the quality education and research opportunities they have come to expect, and the support and services they need to be successful. At the same time, we are committed to creating safer learning, working, and living conditions for our students, staff, and faculty, which we all deserve. We are mindful of the differential impacts of this pandemic on members of our community and society, and the importance of considering issues of equity as we work together to find solutions and uphold our principles of community.

During this beautiful springtime on campus, Dilling and I miss all the daily interactions among our dynamic academic community, and the smiles and vibrancy each of you brings to our campus. We look forward to the moment we can welcome our students, faculty, and staff back to campus, and to an eventual return to the community that makes UC Santa Barbara so important to us all.

Take good care, and be well.

Sincerely,

Henry T. Yang

Santa Barbara,18-Apr-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

We were informed today by a private company with access to our Nanofabrication facility in the Engineering-Sciences Building, that one of their employees who was in our facility on April 8 and 9, carrying out approved essential research, may have had COVID-19. The person did not have symptoms until April 10 and was tested several days later, and then informed their employer of testing positive. We wish them a fast, healthy recovery.

The company reported that the individual, who is not affiliated with UC Santa Barbara, was only in our Nanofabrication facility and has not been back to campus since April 9, which was prior to the onset of symptoms. We were also informed that the individual followed all of the Nanofabrication facility’s safety and health protocols while in the building.

This facility, which provides access to both campus and outside users, has strict physical distancing requirements and requires the use of masks and gloves at all times while in the facility. As a cleanroom facility, the Nanofabrication facility protocols also include regular extensive cleanings and large air exchange volumes.

While there is a low risk that anyone in our community was exposed, out of an abundance of caution and concern for our community, the facility area where the individual was working will be deep cleaned, and we will follow all CDC procedures. Individuals who may have been in the area at the same time as this person are being contacted and the campus is issuing a timely warning as required by the Clery Act. To keep our community informed, we will be posting information about future confirmed COVID-19 cases on our COVID-19 information page.

Our highest priority is the health and well-being of our community. Our campus facilities will continue to follow strict laboratory safety protocols and existing guidance allowing access only to individuals conducting approved essential research or providing essential services.

This case reminds us of just how important it is continue to follow longstanding public health recommendations: 

Individuals who feel sick should stay at home.
If you develop flu-like symptoms, contact your healthcare provider for medical advice.
If you have flu-like symptoms and you are a member of the UC Santa Barbara community providing essential services, notify your supervisor and self-quarantine for 14 days in consideration of your health and that of others.
Most campus employees continue to telework. Only specific individuals who have been notified that they are designated as providing essential services are authorized to be on campus.
Continue to follow the California “Shelter-in-Residence” order, practice physical distancing, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, and cover your face when you must be away from your residence.
We care deeply about our community and visitors to our campus. We will continue to keep our campus community updated through email messages and posting information to our COVID-19 information page.

Please stay safe and look out for each other.

Sincerely,

Henry T. Yang

Santa Barbara,13-Apr-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

With our spring quarter now well underway, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our students, faculty, and staff for the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices you have made, and for your steadfast commitment to upholding the values and mission of our university. We are absolutely amazed by the adaptability, resilience, and creativity of our UC Santa Barbara community in responding to the abrupt changes we are all being asked to make.

In order to give members of our community as much time as possible to plan for summer instruction at UC Santa Barbara, we have made the decision, in consultation with faculty, students, and staff and with the agreement of our Academic Senate, that all Summer Sessions courses scheduled to begin in June and July (sessions A, C, D, and E) will be delivered by remote instruction. 

It is likely that Summer Sessions courses and programs scheduled for August (sessions B, F, and G) will also be delivered remotely, if the State and County orders promoting physical distancing have not been revised. We will continue to consult with our Academic Senate, our health experts, and members of our community, and to work with State and County health officials to make a final determination for August instruction and communicate it to our campus community as soon as possible.

Summer Sessions has posted information about the schedule/calendar and FAQs online, and asked that questions be directed to info@summer.ucsb.edu.   

Being part of a campus community like ours naturally includes the opportunity for academic instruction and inquiry, but it also has intangible benefits. Much of our strength as a community comes from the relationships we make, the opportunity we have to learn from our peers, and the support we offer to each other. It is important that even while we are physically apart, we are finding ways to remain connected during these difficult times. While we know there are still challenges ahead and that we must continue to protect our community and those we love by practicing physical distancing, we are uplifted by hope and the prospect of welcoming everyone back to campus when it is safe to do so. We eagerly await the return of our entire community — our students, staff, and faculty — so that we can continue our journey together.

Santa Barbara,07-Apr-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing to share that our campus has been informed of what seems to be the first case of COVID-19 among our student population. A student who left campus on Tuesday, March 17, for spring break has reported testing positive for COVID-19. During the break, the student reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Following two weeks of self-quarantine and over a week with no symptoms, the student returned to campus on Friday, April 3, for about two hours in order to remove personal belongings from their room in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. After returning home, the student received notice that they tested positive. 

The student’s visit to campus on April 3 was brief, and they reported not interacting with or coming into contact with anyone from our campus. The student, whose roommates left campus prior to spring break, reported spending time in their residence only, wearing a face covering, diligently practicing social distancing, washing and sanitizing hands frequently, and touching only their own personal belongings. We are cleaning and sanitizing both the student’s room and the common areas, and we have contacted public health officials.

According to Santa Barbara County public health officials and our campus health experts, the risk of any exposure to members of our campus community from this student’s brief visit is extremely low.

Our thoughts and warm wishes are with our student and their family, and we are grateful to them for following health and safety protocols that are in place to protect our community.

This student case further illustrates the critical importance of social distancing, frequent hand washing, and face coverings. We want to make sure our campus community is aware of the new recommendations regarding the use of cloth face coverings. These are issued by the Centers for Disease Control, the California Department of Public Health, and our own Santa Barbara County Public Health officials. 

Our campus health experts also are now recommending face coverings for people who come to campus to perform essential university functions. Face coverings can keep people who have the virus but are asymptomatic from spreading it to others. Evidence shows that covering the mouth and nose can be effective in reducing the release of airborne respiratory droplets that can infect others.

The new guidance recommends bandannas, scarves, and simple homemade cloth versions as coverings for the general public. Health experts continue to stress the need to maintain the much-needed supply of N-95 and surgical masks for doctors, nurses, and other frontline personnel. 

We will continue to send updates to our campus community or post updates to our COVID-19 website as information becomes available. 

And as we navigate these difficult times, I hope you will continue to take care of yourselves and each other. Our strength, both individually and collectively, is rooted in our support for one another.

Santa Barbara,31-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

We write to share two important COVID-19 related developments. 

Santa Barbara County Public Health Department has deployed GIS mapping to more precisely identify locations of confirmed cases. As a result, a previously confirmed case of COVID-19 was found to be located within the boundaries of the Isla Vista community. We have no indication that this case involves anyone affiliated with UC Santa Barbara, but given the proximity of Isla Vista to campus, the number of our students who live in Isla Vista, and our faculty and staff who live in Isla Vista or adjacent communities, we wanted to notify our campus community of this development. We send our best wishes to this individual as they recover. 

We would like to use this opportunity to remind our students, especially those who remain in campus housing and who live in Isla Vista, of the actions we can all take to save lives by helping slow the spread of COVID-19. In addition to the preventative actions recommended by the CDC, we strongly urge everyone to follow Governor Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order and the IV Community Services District’s state-of-emergency declaration that directs everyone to stay inside, avoid social gatherings with anyone other than those who share your living space, and practice social/physical distancing. Please read a new message from our faculty health experts, our Associated Students president, and our Student Health medical director that I have included as an attachment below. Every one of us has an important role to play in battling this pandemic.

In addition to the case in Isla Vista, we were informed by two members of our UC Santa Barbara community who live together that they both tested positive for COVID-19 after one of the individuals returned from travel to Europe on Friday, March 13. Both individuals have not been on campus and have been in self-quarantine since March 13. They currently remain in self-quarantine off campus and are recovering. Our thoughts and well-wishes are with our two colleagues.  

These confirmed cases in our community will raise concerns and questions. Our highest priority is protecting the health of each and every one of you, but we also are committed to ensuring everyone’s privacy. Santa Barbara County Public Health conducts thorough investigations of positive cases and notifies any individuals they believe may have had contact with the confirmed cases. We will work closely with public health officials to follow notification procedures and guidelines and to keep our community informed.

For our community members who may be feeling anxiety and stress, we urge you to reach out and contact campus support services. Students in need can reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and Mental Health Peers, and faculty and staff can contact the Academic & Staff Assistance Program (ASAP). Additional information and assistance are available at our Office of International Students and Scholars and our Student Health Service (SHS) as well.

We are thankful to everyone in our community for playing their part to slow the spread of this virus. We also want to express our deepest appreciation to all of those individuals who are on the frontlines, here on campus and across the nation and globe – risking their own health and safety to protect us and to support the daily life of our communities. We are grateful for their heroism. 

Please take good care of yourselves and each other.

Letter to Our UC Santa Barbara Students

Students at UC Santa Barbara — We are now at a critical moment.

We are writing to inform you that the number of cases is increasing rapidly in Santa Barbara County. There are 88 cases as of today, 14 of which are in individuals younger than 29, and one confirmed case in Isla Vista. If we can slow the spread of the disease throughout IV by minimizing contact with each other, every one of us — but especially you, our students — will be the heroes of our community. By standing strong in adherence with strict social distancing, we can beat this disease.

To the people who have been taking their social responsibilities seriously, we thank you. Thank you for being strong and accepting the challenge of staying at home and taking these precautions. 

Our message remains simple: We need your help now more than ever. With the rapidly mounting case numbers of COVID-19 in our communities, we have reached a tipping point. If we fail to act decisively at this moment, this disease will extract a terrible toll on our community. It is not an exaggeration to say that without maintaining social distance, our community will very likely lose lives to this invisible virus. In a very short time, COVID-19 could spread within the close quarters of Isla Vista, leaving no one untouched. 

We understand there are many temptations: socializing with friends you do not live with, gathering at the beach, having Deltopia. We ask each of you to be a leader and to communicate to your friends that the social proximity of large parties and gatherings, especially one like Deltopia, is dangerous. This is the time to be mindful and smart. Doing the right thing now will give you the gift of another day, in the not too distant future, to enjoy with your friends and family. We know this isn’t easy, but we can overcome this together.

Please remember how COVID-19 spreads. It begins with a small number of cases. Some people may not even know they have the virus, because sometimes its symptoms are mild. During this time, the virus is silently working its way through the community, and before long, the number of cases will increase dramatically. Large numbers of people will become infected. Young people are not exempt. You can suffer for weeks and weeks with the illness and sustain lifelong damage to your lungs or kidneys. You can infect others including your parents and grandparents for whom the disease has a high risk of mortality. In a crowded place like Isla Vista, the virus will spread quickly, so we must strictly adhere to social distancing.

What is social distancing? Deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illnesses. Staying at least 6 feet from others reduces your risk of catching COVID-19. Six feet is about the length of a pool table. 

How can I practice social distancing? Avoid gatherings and parties, avoid handshakes and hugs, and limit contact with people. 

Does it work? YES! 
• Without social distancing, one person can infect 2.5 people on day one and a total of 460 people over 30 days. 

• By reducing social contacts by 50%, one person can infect 1.25 people on day one and a total of 15 people over 30 days. That is a reduction of over 30-fold!

Remember COVID-19 does not discriminate. It can come from any person, at any time, in any place. Do not treat those you believe may have COVID-19 with acts of racism or hate. There is no room for that behavior in our community. Let us come together during this tough time. We thank you all again for your continued cooperation in doing your part.

Santa Barbara,26-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

This spring break, I find myself saddled with a sadness and a sense of loss regarding the sudden changes our community is being asked to bear. The disappearance of our community and the realization that we will miss all the opportunities to spend time with our students, staff, and faculty this spring quarter is still difficult to accept. As Dilling and I walk alone through the picturesque pathways of our once bustling campus, we are now feeling the silence and the absence of the commotion that characterize discovery and learning. 

But we are also lifted by hope and the understanding that our community is dynamic, innovative, and compassionate, especially when facing a challenge. It is clear that much has already changed and that things will continue to change, but if we hold fast to our goals, we can achieve them, even if it means navigating frustrating detours or exploring unexpected new paths. 

Following Governor Newsom’s recent stay-at-home order and following consultation with students, faculty, and our academic deans, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our annual commencement ceremonies, which were scheduled to take place in June. 

Every year we eagerly await gathering for this time-honored tradition, and in light of this decision, we are committed to:

• Holding an in-person ceremony when it is safe to do so — welcoming all of our 2020 graduates and their families back to our campus so that we can celebrate their numerous accomplishments together.

• Holding a virtual ceremony on the second weekend of June that will allow us to recognize the achievements of our graduating students at the end of our spring quarter.

We know that this decision is a tremendous disappointment to our graduates, who for years have devoted themselves to reaching this milestone and have looked forward with great anticipation to the celebration that would mark their academic accomplishment. And we know it is just as disappointing to the families and friends who have supported our students in their scholarly endeavors, and for whom commencement represents a shared and equally important achievement. 

It is also a disappointment for us — the faculty and staff who have made the journeys of our students our own. We take pride in watching each and every graduate participate in all the pomp and circumstance of a commencement ceremony — walking across the stage in cap and gown as their names are read, to receive their diploma or to be hooded, and to be greeted by their faculty, mentors, and myself.    

While some may believe our situation will abate within a few months, the public health information we are receiving suggests the rapid and evolving nature of COVID-19 makes the risk to our community too great to allow large gatherings such as our UC Santa Barbara Commencement.

From our consultation with students and parents, and from the countless messages we have received, we are reminded just how important commencement is for our students and their families. It is just as important to us. Each of our graduates is special and carries a unique story of triumph. This is why we thought it necessary to share our current thinking with our community now, and to affirm our commitment to hosting an event on campus when the situation allows.

Thank you again for standing alongside us as we take steps to respond to this unprecedented situation. We look forward to the time when our campus life can return to the vibrant experience we’ve all come to expect and love at UC Santa Barbara.   
 

Sincerely,

Henry T. Yang

Santa Barbara,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

Tonight, Governor Gavin Newsom and the California State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order directing all residents of California to stay at home or their place of residence effective immediately and until further notice. According to the order, essential services (gas, grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) and state and local government functions, including the higher education sector, will remain open.  

As an institution of higher education, our campus will remain open to provide essential services, but in order to comply with the order, we will need to further minimize the number of people on campus as much as possible while still maintaining the critical functions of the University, including offering remote instruction for the spring quarter. 

• At this time, only those employees who must be on campus to maintain critical operations and functions should come to the campus. Those individuals who cannot work from home and are not designated as essential service providers by their managers or supervisors are eligible for paid administrative leave described in the recent executive order by UC President Janet Napolitano.
• Any remaining in-person finals scheduled for Friday are canceled, and alternative arrangements for those finals will be made at a later date. 
• Our campus housing and dining services will continue operations as planned in order to support those students who need to remain in campus housing. 
• Student Health Services will continue to provide service to our students who remain in the area.

Our campus has already taken a number of proactive actions to help protect the health and well-being of our community that are consistent with the new order, including:

• Ending in-person instruction for the spring quarter;
• Minimizing the number of people on campus through remote work arrangements;
• Closing the UC Santa Barbara Library, UCen, RecCen, and the SRB;
• Ending non-essential business-related travel.

We are in the process of evaluating additional actions that may be required as a result of this statewide order, and will write again with additional updates as soon as possible. The health and well-being of our community is our top priority, and will continue to guide the steps we take to address these extraordinary circumstances.

Santa Barbara,18-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing to provide an update on our campus’s response to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

Isla Vista COVID-19 Test and Social Distancing
First, I want to share the news that all five of our students who were identified over the weekend in Isla Vista have tested negative for COVID-19, according to information just released by the Santa Barbara County Department of Public Health. Our students are no longer in mandatory quarantine, but were directed to self-quarantine by Health Officer Order and to practice social distancing.

We strongly urge everyone – our students, staff, and faculty, especially those who remain on campus and in Isla Vista – to follow best practices related to social distancing and other health practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. The situation is very serious, and it is up to all of us to take the necessary precautions to help keep ourselves and one another safe. 

While our experts tell us that most people who acquire COVID-19 will not develop severe disease, the related health risks to those with underlying conditions and to our aging populations are extremely high. If any one of us becomes infected, it will pose a potentially life-threatening risk of infection to other people. The virus, our experts say, can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients, or days before symptoms begin. This makes social distancing and similar health practices vitally important to saving lives.

Library Services 
To protect the health and welfare of everyone who works in and uses our Library, and to be consistent with the directives of state public health officials and recommendations by health experts, we have made the difficult decision to close our UC Santa Barbara Library to patrons starting at 6 p.m. on Thursday, March 19, 2020. Our Music Library will be closing today, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, at 6 p.m.

Our Library provides essential and important services for our students and faculty, and we know that closing the Library to patrons poses another significant challenge. Our dedicated Library staff will do everything possible, taking into consideration social distancing requirements and other health safety measures, in order to continue to provide services in support of remote instruction, learning, and research. Available Library services and updates will be posted on the Library’s website.  

We will continue to send timely updates to our community regarding our campus response in order to provide as much information and clarity as soon as possible during this time of uncertainty. We remain deeply grateful for everyone’s community-mindedness and willingness to make self-sacrifices in support of the well-being of our entire community. 

Sincerely,

Henry T. Yang
Chancellor",447,cal,3
Santa Barbara,17-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing with additional updates on our campus’s response to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community, and to share the results of the COVID-19 test our Student Health team conducted on our student in Isla Vista.

Isla Vista COVID-19 Test
The one student tested by Student Health, who had been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, has tested negative. While this is good news, Santa Barbara County Public Health has directed all five of the students in Isla Vista who Public Health identified over the weekend to remain in quarantine. We are in close coordination with county Public Health officials, and will share with our community any information the county releases as soon as it becomes available.

We continue to strongly urge everyone, especially our students on campus and in Isla Vista, to follow best practices related to social distancing and other health practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. All of us being community-minded, making sacrifices, and doing our part will ultimately help save lives.

Updated Administrative Leave Guidance
Finally, I want to share updated guidance regarding emergency and administrative leave. Yesterday evening, UC President Janet Napolitano issued an Executive Order allowing up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave for all employees, including student workers, to help them address the particular challenges they are facing as a result of COVID-19.  

The new guidance stipulates that “the hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university service.”

Additional details about the new policy, including the purposes for which the administrative leave may be used, were sent in an earlier message this afternoon to our staff. We are once again asking managers to exercise maximum flexibility to help our dedicated staff colleagues and student workers during this challenging time.

We are extremely grateful to our community for all the hard work all of us are doing during this complex and difficult campus transition. We realize that many of us are overwhelmed and struggling. Please know we are working to provide services and support to those in need, and to provide as much timely information and clarity as possible in these times of uncertainty.

Santa Barbara,15-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing to share with you another update on the COVID-19 situation in our local community.

While there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus, there are several individuals from the UC Santa Barbara community who live off-campus who have self-reported possible contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or self-reported travel to areas where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed.

While none of these individuals or their close contacts have exhibited serious symptoms linked to COVID-19, out of an abundance of caution, Student Health contacted Santa Barbara County Public Health and administered a precautionary test for one individual. This individual and several others who had been in close contact with the individual were directed to self-isolate.

Santa Barbara County Public Health has been working in Isla Vista to identify others in the community who may have had close contact with this individual. Public Health officials have notified the community that out of an abundance of caution, five UC Santa Barbara students who live off-campus have been placed in quarantine off-campus. We will update our community as soon as possible with information as it becomes available.

Students with health questions should visit our Student Health website for up-to-date information and medical contact information.

Please see my message from yesterday for updated information and guidance
regarding plans for spring quarter instruction. Again, we urge all students who can safely leave campus for the spring quarter to do so.

The health, safety, and well-being of our campus and local community is our top priority. We are working closely with our county officials, and doing all we can to protect our campus family.

Santa Barbara,14-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I would like to acknowledge what a challenging time this has been for all of us. Together we have worked collaboratively and continuously to take precautions against the COVID-19 virus. The current situation is serious, and we need to make adjustments to our normal routine in order to prevent widespread transmission in our community. This communication will cover:

Decision to end all in-person instruction and continue remote instruction for the entire spring quarter
Decision to urge students who can safely leave to do so and to take all of their personal items from their university-owned housing
Guidance for students and parents on housing and dining services
More detailed guidance preparing for increasing social distancing through remote work for our staff colleagues
COVID-19 Response Working Group rationale 
Extending Remote Instruction 
Our initial announcement to transition to remote instruction through April was made as a proactive step in order to protect our community and to give everyone as much clarity as possible at the time we made the decision. As the situation has continued to evolve, we have made the difficult decision, in consultation with many of our students, faculty, and staff, to extend remote instruction through the entire spring quarter and to end all in-person instruction. 

We are asking instructors, who are faced with the daunting task of adjusting to remote instruction, to extend their planning through the spring quarter. We know that there will be specific courses that cannot be taught effectively in remote formats. Faculty and departments will have to exercise maximum flexibility in these unique circumstances. 

We will continue to work to be as accommodating as possible in an attempt to make sure all of our students are able to receive the courses they need to fulfill requirements. However, given the extraordinary circumstances that we are facing, there will be individual challenges among students, faculty, and staff that must be addressed. We will share additional guidance as soon as it is developed. 

While we know how disappointing this situation is, especially for our graduating students, social distancing and lowering the density on campus is the best way to mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19, according to our health experts.

Housing
With these changes and in order to lower the density on campus, we are also urging students who can safely leave to do so and to take all of their personal items from their university-owned housing. We have a small window to take proactive steps to protect our community, and we are asking everyone to do their best and to be community-minded. Instructions related to moving out of campus housing will be forthcoming. 

Housing and dining refunds have been addressed in guidance sent directly to students to help with decisions for the coming spring quarter. Related questions can be directed to housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu or 805-893-4371.

We are also reviewing options related to campus-based fees as well as financial aid considerations, and will be communicating separately by the end of next week with students and parents as new policy is developed. 

Our campus remains open and operational in order to accommodate our students who need to stay and to continue with our research mission. We will do our best to continue to offer roles to our student employees, although the work may be modified based on campus needs. 

Staff
We continue to urge managers to exercise maximum flexibility in working with members of our staff, prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees. We know that the K-12 school closures across the region have only added to the pressure on our community. Our offices of Administrative Services and Human Resources yesterday issued more detailed guidance preparing for increasing social distancing through remote work. Staff should consult with their managers. 

Our COVID-19 Response Working Group continues to convene daily to monitor the evolving situation. I have also spent many hours talking with and listening to our students, staff, and faculty across campus. Their invaluable thoughts and ideas have made a great impact on the decisions we have been making. We so value the input of each of our community members. 

We greatly appreciate your flexibility and understanding as we navigate this challenging time together. Thank you for all you do to support and care for our UC Santa Barbara family. 

Sincerely,

Henry T. Yang
Chancellor


COVID-19 Response Working Group Rationale
In explaining the basis for our recommendations, we ask that you understand the gravity of this threat and remain calm. Our recommendations are based on the evidence, and the evidence strongly suggests that we can get this pandemic under control if we follow the guidelines.

To understand the gravity of the situation, consider how rapidly the virus spreads. An approximate rate of spread is doubling every two days. If one person is positive for the virus, that means in one month there will be thousands of cases if no measures are taken. If in the more likely case a group of people are infected at once, say 10 people, in one month we will have tens of thousands of cases. Here are some concrete examples:  

Based on the current situation in other regions of the world, it is estimated that if drastic measures are not taken early to prevent transmission, 40-70% of the U.S. population will be infected within 12 to 18 months. In Italy, two weeks ago there were 300 cases, one week ago there were 2,500 cases, and today there are over 21,000 cases. In the U.S., two weeks ago we had fewer than 100 cases, one week ago we had over 400 cases, and today we have close to 2,500 cases and 51 confirmed deaths. If the infection continues as it is, next week we will have tens of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths. The risk of severe disease and fatality is elevated in high-risk populations – individuals over 65 and those with underlying conditions. There are no vaccines or treatments available at this moment for the general population. If the infection continues unrestrained, the impact of COVID-19 in our healthcare system will be severe.

The current situation is serious, and we need to make adjustments to our normal routines. We need to act fast. In other regions of the world, like Hong Kong and Singapore, where early precautionary measures were taken, the mortality rate is as low as 0.5%. In places where the measures were adopted later, the reported mortality rate is between 3-10%. Time is of the essence. The virus is transmitted by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms appear between 2 to 14 days after exposure. There is an unknown fraction of the population that shows mild or no symptoms.

Even if you do not develop severe disease or show symptoms, you can still transmit the virus to other people. We need to work together to prevent widespread transmission in our community. These are some of the measures we need to take as a community:

PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN THE COMMUNITY. Try to avoid crowded places and social gatherings (lots of people in small spaces). You can be most safe by minimizing unnecessary contact with others.
Keep your distance from others. It is recommended to be about 6 feet from people in close spaces (cafes, elevators, library, etc.).
Wash your hands for more than 20 seconds with soap and water.
IF YOU ARE SICK, STAY HOME. Expect to be home for two weeks.
Have a plan in case you get sick. Include the following items in your plan:
How are you going to isolate yourself (how long, where)? 
Who are you to contact if you have symptoms (doctor phone number, Student Health, friend, family member)? 
If you are in isolation and have a need, who will you contact?
Stay calm. We understand this is a stressful situation for everybody, but remember that we can work together to get this pandemic under control.",1317,cal,3
Santa Barbara,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I write to follow up on my earlier message regarding the steps the University is taking to protect the health and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty, and to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. 

The coronavirus pandemic we are facing needs an urgent response from our entire UC Santa Barbara community. As of today, we do not have any cases on campus or in Santa Barbara County. However, cases are rapidly spreading around the country. Undetected cases are likely to be present more widely than we can now detect. Once a case lands in a community, you can think of it as an ember that will start a new fire. We need to be prepared for the potential of COVID-19 transmission on our campus, and this requires the collective effort of our entire community. In these challenging times, we appreciate and thank everyone for taking a community-minded approach. 

Our health experts advise that the COVID-19 pandemic should not be viewed as a regular cold, or even as a new kind of flu. The virus can cause severe disease, and presents a high risk of mortality, particularly among the aging and chronically ill. Even if a young adult gets a mild form of the disease, it can be transmitted to parents or grandparents or others in the community in whom the disease can be deadly. Many cases require hospitalization, and the system can rapidly become overwhelmed. We urgently ask everyone to carefully consider their own vulnerability and that of those around them. Please continue to be aware and keep informed. 

By working together and being community minded, we can help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in a way that will help our medical community in responding to this evolving crisis. Our sister UC campuses and numerous other universities across the country are taking similar action, which is in line with recommendations of many health experts regarding social distancing in order to slow the spread of COVID-19.

To expand on the earlier guidance from the COVID-19 Response Working Group (members listed below), we want to be more clear: 

• By not coming back to campus after travel, our students can play a significant and critical role in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We are asking students who are traveling for spring break to stay away from campus for at least the month of April. We are asking those students who plan to stay on campus for April not to travel during spring break. 

• No student will be required to attend in-person lectures or seminars during the month of April. We are asking our colleagues to be flexible in making accommodations at all levels.

• Students who are planning to leave campus will receive the same education as those who stay and will not be disadvantaged for remaining away. We are continuing to work out issues related to work-study, financial aid, housing, and dining so that none of our students are disadvantaged by these changes. Please know that responding to all the different individual cases in order to make accommodations will take time. 

• Due to the shift from in-person final exams to on-line and other alternatives, we are extending the deadline for winter grades by one week to 11:59PM, Tuesday, March 31, 2020. To minimize the impact on our students, we urge those who can, to please submit grades by the original deadline or as soon as possible.

• The campus will remain open and operational in order to accommodate our students who need to stay on campus and to continue critical research activities. Keeping the campus operational and achieving the highest standards of remote instruction cannot be accomplished without our dedicated staff and faculty. We will follow UCOP’s guidance in order to protect their health and well-being while asking managers to exercise maximum flexibility.

We understand how the decision to move toward remote instruction and limiting the presence of our students on campus has created a great deal of uncertainty not only for our students, but also for our faculty, staff, parents, and visitors to our campus. We deeply apologize for the hardships and the increased anxiety this disruption is causing for all of us. We did not make the decision lightly. It was driven by our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our students and their families, as well as that of our dedicated staff and faculty. 

We know this decision calls on many of us to sacrifice our own personal interests in service to the greater well-being of our campus community, as well as Isla Vista, Goleta, Santa Barbara, and the families of our students, faculty, and staff. 

This transition will be difficult. It will take time. An institution as complex and decentralized as a university campus, especially one as committed to shared governance as UC Santa Barbara, cannot change in one day or even in one week. What we can do, however, is work tirelessly to implement the changes, to develop new policies, and to provide information and updates through this challenging transition. We will listen to and appreciate the concerns raised by our community so we can understand the hardships and disruptions, and find ways to address and mitigate them wherever possible. 

To our faculty and teaching community, please know that we are working to support your efforts in rapidly adjusting to new instructional modalities. 

For our students and parents, please know that our entire faculty, our instructors, and our staff are working around the clock to answer your questions (see FAQs here), address your concerns, and ensure that we can continue to maintain the highest educational standards despite the threat posed and disruption caused by COVID-19.

For our staff, who provide the foundational support for our mission of education, research, and service, please know that we remain committed to keeping our community safe and to being as accommodating as possible, with maximum flexibility, during this unprecedented set of circumstances. 

We have experienced the tremendous capacity of our community to overcome hardship, natural disaster, and tragedy. We know our community is compassionate, supportive, and resilient. We know our community embraces a challenge, and welcomes innovation and change. We are proud of the strengths of our UC Santa Barbara community. I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary efforts being made by our staff, our faculty, and our students.

Santa Barbara,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing to share the news that Dean Carol Genetti of our Graduate Division has accepted the position of Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Programs at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, beginning September 1, 2020. We will greatly miss Dean Genetti’s leadership and service to our campus, but we are excited for this opportunity for her and wish her all the best in her new position.

As our inaugural Anne and Michael Towbes Graduate Dean, Dr. Genetti has done exceptional and innovative work to develop programs that enhance graduate education and the graduate student experience. For example, she has provided enriched support for career development for our campus, and implemented courses in university pedagogy and graduate writing. She created the award-winning Grad Slam, now a signature event for UC. She instituted UC Crossroads, which has funded twelve year-long interdisciplinary research and teaching projects. During her tenure, we have increased financial support for graduate students, including establishment of the International Doctoral Recruitment Fellowship. Especially notable, she has created programs that foster inclusiveness and support for students who have been traditionally underserved by the academy, such as the Graduate Scholars Program, the fall Diversity Matters series, and the Action Collaborative Steering Committee, which she co-chairs. We are deeply grateful for her accomplishments and her dedication to graduate education, diversity, and outreach.

Beyond her eight years as Graduate Dean, Dr. Genetti has contributed to our campus in countless ways over the last three decades. She served as Associate Dean for Humanities and Fine Arts from 2005 to 2012, as Chair of our Department of Linguistics from 1999 to 2005, and as a distinguished member of our Linguistics faculty since 1990.

Her research has focused on linguistic typology, and especially on the documentation and description of Himalayan languages. She is co-founder and managing editor of the online journal Himalayan Linguistics. Her monograph A Grammar of Dolakha Newar was awarded the inaugural von der Gabelentz Award from the Association for Linguistic Typology. She has been actively involved in efforts to preserve the world’s linguistic diversity; she founded a biennial institute on language documentation and revitalization, and is the former Chair of the LSA Committee on Endangered Languages and their Preservation.

I will be consulting with our Executive Vice Chancellor, Vice Chancellor for Research, Academic Deans, Academic Senate, administrative colleagues, and members of our campus community on the appointment of an Acting Dean for our Graduate Division, and I look forward to announcing this appointment in the near future. We will also move quickly to form a search advisory committee to conduct a search for this important position.

Please join me in extending our warmest thanks and congratulations to Carol.

Santa Barbara,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,

I am writing to update you on a number of immediate actions our campus is taking to help protect the health and well-being of our campus community.

Following the discussions with our COVID-19 Response Working Group and recommendations from public health experts, we are asking community members to assist us in taking proactive steps to mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 here on campus, in IV, and in the broader Santa Barbara community. We know that many of these recommendations will be challenging to implement, but it is important that we take the necessary steps now to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, despite the fact that no cases have been reported on campus or in Santa Barbara County.

Our campus will be transitioning to remote instruction for the remainder of Winter Quarter and the start of the Spring Quarter through at least the end of April. Given our campus’s transition to remote instruction and the possibility of additional travel disruptions and restrictions, we are recommending that all undergraduate students traveling for spring break be prepared for the possibility of remaining away from campus through the month of April. We understand that graduate students have different academic commitments and recommend that they consult with their advisors and departments.  

The campus will remain open and operational, including Housing and Dining, which will continue normal operations.

Based on advice from the leading health experts, the following actions are necessary to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

Instruction
• Effective March 11, 2020, for the remainder of Winter Quarter, we strongly recommend that instructors make alternative arrangements for in-person classes and for final exams. In addition to alternative assignments, such as remote exams, instructors may make use of Proctor U for online exams. Instructors will be communicating directly with their students with more specific details.
• To the extent possible, instructors and departments should make plans to shift Spring Quarter classes from in-person formats to remote formats, using alternative modalities, at least through the month of April.
• Students who remain on campus through the break and during the month of April will also be receiving instruction remotely, and must also be prepared for limited on-campus activities and services. More detailed guidance and information about services for students will follow in subsequent communications.
• Additional guidelines and information will be sent to instructors to assist with this transition.

Our COVID-19 Response Working Group will continue to consult and evaluate the evolving situation in the coming days and weeks in order to make additional recommendations related to instruction for the Spring Quarter. We know that this transition is not going to be easy and we will all need to be flexible.

Travel
We are recommending against all non-essential business travel, international and domestic, for UC Santa Barbara employees through the end of April. This guidance is in addition to current UC systemwide restrictions already in place to CDC Level 3 (widespread community transmission) and Level 2 (sustained community transmission) countries.

With spring break approaching, we also encourage our faculty, staff, and students to carefully consider the risks associated with travel, both international and domestic. All personal international travel is strongly discouraged and we urge extreme caution and judgement for your personal domestic travel.

Events
While no UC systemwide restrictions on large events or mass gatherings have been implemented at this time, the COVID-19 Response Working Group recommends that campus groups strongly consider postponing, canceling, or rescheduling crowded on-campus events.

The Athletics Department will be moving to “fan-less” events.

The CDC provides guidance on mass gatherings and large events.  

Working Remotely and Staff Leave Policy
We urge managers to use maximum flexibility in working with members of our staff in order to address challenges caused by COVID-19.  

The Office of the President has enacted temporary emergency leave policies in anticipation of potential scenarios. The Working Group recommends that managers work with employees to explore opportunities to work remotely when job duties permit.  Highlights of the policy are below and the full guidelines can be found online.  
 
• Managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status.
• Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence.

Santa Barbara,07-Mar-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,
 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of our colleagues across campus and throughout the UC who are working collaboratively and continuously to help us respond as a community to the evolving situation with the COVID-19 virus.
 
As of March 7, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on campus or anywhere in Santa Barbara County, and there are no recommendations by any public health agencies to suspend campus operations or modify any class schedules. However, with the increased availability of testing, we can expect that more people will be tested when displaying certain symptoms, and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are expected to continue to grow in California, and possibly in our region and/or university community. We are closely monitoring this fluid situation in our local community in collaboration with public health agencies, and we will work together to meet any challenges that may present themselves.
 
The well-being of our community is our highest priority. We are vigilantly working with every area of our campus to monitor and respond to the situation as it continues to evolve. We are following the guidance of our local public health agencies and the CDC. We are working to adapt our robust response and continuity plans to this current threat, and to maintain a healthy and safe living, learning, and working environment for all of us.
 
Many campus offices, including Instructional Development, COLLABORATE, the Center for Innovative, Teaching, Research and Learning (CITRAL), and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, have been working to enhance instructional technology and create an infrastructure that would maintain continuity of instruction and support both students and faculty who might be unable to participate face-to-face in classes or exams, should COVID-19 emerge locally and potentially disrupt academic operations. As we did during the Thomas Fire and road closures, a variety of strategies would be deployed should public health officials advise that the campus take additional steps, including on-line lectures and/or assignments, take-home finals, remotely proctored exams, and other alternative arrangements that would ensure that students could complete their coursework. We encourage instructors to ensure that GauchoSpace sites are active for each of their courses so they could communicate easily and efficiently with their students.

We continue to follow the guidelines provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), as well as the guidance of UC Office of the President. We have created a COVID-19 website, where you will find the most up-to-date information the campus has available as well as links to other important sites, including:
• UC Santa Barbara Student Health
• University of California Response to Coronavirus (COVID-19)
• UCOP Travel Restriction Guidance
• UCEAP Program Suspensions and Updates
• California Department of Public Health (CDPH)
• US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
• US Department of State Travel Advisories
 
We can all help to keep our community healthy and safe by using everyday preventive care, including the following:
• Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects at home, work, and school.

If you experience flu-like symptoms:
• Stay home.
• Students should contact Student Health Services at (805) 893-7129 to receive guidance from an advice nurse.
• Faculty and staff members should contact their primary health care provider.

For members of our staff, in situations involving self-quarantine or other circumstances that may warrant an employee's absence from work, we encourage managers to work with Human Resources & Labor Relations to make every effort possible to help in identifying available options. UC Santa Barbara employees have access to Academic & Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) services, which offers free counseling and referral assistance for employees and eligible family members and can help individuals coping with anxiety, stress, loss, and more. More information about ASAP services is available at https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/asap.  
 
To enhance campus coordination and augment the efforts of our existing campus pandemic response team that have been underway since the initial reports of COVID-19, we have established a COVID-19 Response Working Group, coordinated out of the Office of the Chancellor. The Working Group, listed below, includes all of our vice chancellors, Academic Senate leadership, and individuals who have been involved in our campus-wide preparation efforts over the past two months, as well as faculty expertise in the area of virus-host interactions, health, and microbiology. The Working Group will meet daily in order to advise on policy decisions and implementation related to our ongoing COVID-19 response. We will also be consulting closely with our students and members of our staff to help inform our actions.
 
We know that many in our community are understandably anxious about COVID-19 and the unknowns that it poses, but we have always been a strong community and pulled through whatever challenges have come our way. We would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our shared commitment to treating all members of our community with respect, and to upholding our Principles of Community. It is unacceptable to discriminate against or profile any members of our community.
 
I am deeply grateful to our community members for all of the efforts that have been and will be taken to keep our campus safe.  
 
Sincerely,
 
Henry T. Yang

Santa Barbara,07-Feb-2020,"Dear Members of Our Campus Community,
 
To date, there have not been any cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Santa Barbara County or on our campus. We place the highest priority on the safety and well-being of our campus community, and we are continuing to work closely with our colleagues at the UC Office of the President and other campuses to monitor the global situation and to coordinate with state and local officials to ensure that we are following the guidelines recommended by public health officials.

In accordance with guidance from the U.S. Department of State, UC President Janet Napolitano has also requested that all UC campuses temporarily “avoid all non-essential travel” to China. The UC Office of the President also asked all UC campuses to develop a review and approval processes to determine whether travel to China is essential or can be postponed. University of California restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal, but all travelers should be aware of travel risks and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.
 
In light of UC’s directive, members of our campus community wishing to engage in essential business travel to China will need to obtain prior approval. Please see the appendix below regarding the campus approval process. In addition, any such travelers are urged to register their university business travel with UC Away, which provides benefits and protections in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential services.
 
We would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our shared commitment to treating all members of our community with respect, and to upholding our Principles of Community. It is unacceptable to discriminate against or profile any members of our community.

To help provide our community with answers to questions that arise, our Student Health website is being updated regularly with the latest information available to the University, including links to the Centers for Disease Control and the California Department of Public Health. A Q&A with Student Health Service medical experts is also published on The Current.

We recognize the stress and anxiety that this situation may cause, and we have resources available to help, including Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and Mental Health Peers for students and the Academic & Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) for faculty and staff. More information and assistance are available at our Office of International Students and Scholars and our Student Health Service (SHS) as well.
 
We will continue to update our campus community as new information becomes available. Our thoughts are with all those affected by this challenging public health situation.

Information about the coronavirus
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Gina Fleming, MD, MSPH, Interim Associate Vice Chancellor Student Health and Wellness
January 24, 2020
Dear UC Santa Cruz community,
We know that many of you are concerned about the recent appearance of the coronavirus. Although there have been no confirmed cases on campus, we want to provide you with some information about how to protect your health.  
What is the Coronavirus?
Coronavirus is a group of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, including the common cold. According to the California Department of Public Health, the newest strain of coronavirus started in Wuhan, China. Most patients have had mild illnesses although a few are very sick or have died. As of this morning, two people have tested positive in the United States. No cases have been identified in California.
How is UCSC Student Health Services protecting the campus community?
At the Student Health Center, we check anyone with acute illness for their travel history and/or possible exposure to the virus. We also work closely with our local public health department and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). We follow their guidance about testing, treatment, and communications.
How can I stay healthy if I’m traveling?
CDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to Wuhan, China. Take the following precautions if traveling to other parts of China:
Avoid contact with sick people.
Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
If you traveled to China in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:
Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
Not travel while sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
To avoid sickness, we also recommend getting your flu shot and staying home when you’re sick. Take care of yourself with nutritious meals and plenty of sleep. ",413,cal,1

UC Santa Cruz health officials are closely monitoring the coronavirus and, in coordination with county officials, preparing to manage any outbreaks in our campus community.
To date, there have not been any reported cases in Santa Cruz County or in the Bay Area. There have been two confirmed cases in Southern California, and four other cases in Washington, Arizona, and Illinois.
UC Santa Cruz has an information page online at ucsc.edu/coronavirus that will be updated regularly with new information. 
Coronavirus is group of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, including the common cold. According to the California Department of Public Health, the newest strain of coronavirus started in Wuhan, China.
State officials report that the immediate health risk from the coronavirus to the general public is low. Federal officials recommend that people avoid non-essential travel to China. 
As with any virus, especially during the flu season, the California Department of Public Health reminds people to: 
Wash hands with soap and water.


Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.


Avoid close contact with people who are sick are all ways to reduce the risk of infection with a number of different viruses.


Stay away from work, school or other people to avoid spreading illnesses. 


Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (cell phone, keyboard).


The potential threat of a novel virus can be frightening and overwhelming, with varying accounts and messages on social media and the internet.
Taking the outlined precautionary measures are the appropriate preventative measures in the event of any communicable disease. As a university, we stand to support, include, and protect our diverse and international community.
It is important to remember that isolating or assuming a certain racial group is carrying the disease is counterproductive and can cause unfounded suffering.
Campus community members who are experiencing discrimination or harassment on the basis of their nationality or race are encouraged to report incidents.

Updated directive on non-essential travel restrictions to CDC Level 2 and Level 3 Travel Health Notice countries
For UC Santa Cruz Community, effective February 3, 2020, updated on March 6 and March 26.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide information regarding restrictions of travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries. It provides guidance on the University of California’s Presidential Directive (1/30/2020) and a follow-up directives. President Napolitano issued a letter on March 5 further restricting international travel in accordance with recent CDC guidance. This directive expands the existing travel restriction for CDC Level 3 countries to include CDC Level 2 countries. University travel between these countries and UC Santa Cruz is prohibited without prior approval from campus Risk Services.
This remains a rapidly changing situation and any UC traveler to these regions should carefully evaluate the situation using guidance from the U.S. State Department and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as information provided by WorldAware, UC’s contracted global risk intelligence partner.
BACKGROUND
Following the United Nations’ World Health Organization’s declaration of the coronavirus outbreak in China as a “global health emergency” several federal and state agencies have issued travel advisories. 
In light of these actions, the University of California has restricted University-related travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries. These restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal; personal travelers should be aware of travel risks and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries.
Members of the UCSC community may send questions regarding this procedure to oes@ucsc.edu, a dedicated email account that is monitored by the Office of Emergency Services.
APPROVAL PROCESS PRIOR TO TRAVEL
All UC-business travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries is restricted until further notice. This travel restriction is also applicable to “tack-on” travel. UCSC affiliates traveling for university business to other international locations shall not add add-on visits to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries.
To request approval for essential travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries (essential defined below), university business travelers must follow the applicable approval process as outlined below. Following this process and obtaining prior approval for essential travel will be required for reimbursement of travel expenses.
Faculty, Researchers, Postdoctoral Scholars: Essential travel is defined as travel that is required to:
preserve the safety of a research subject and which is not possible to be postponed; or
preserve the results of a research activity and which is not possible to be postponed.
For faculty, researchers, and postdoctoral scholars, essential travel does not include travel to attend professional or educational conferences. Conferences are just one example of non-essential travel – other activities will also be considered non-essential travel.
To request approval to engage in essential travel, employees in this group should contact their Dean in writing. If the Dean agrees that the proposed travel should be considered essential, the Dean will consult with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the Dean and AVC of Risk and Safety Services agree that the travel is essential, the Dean will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval.
Staff: Staff travel is considered non-essential.
To request an exception to the determination that UCSC-related travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries is non-essential, the staff member should communicate in writing with their unit’s Principal Officer. The Principal Officer will then consult with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the travel is deemed essential, the Principal Officer will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval. The CP/EVC may consult with the AVC of Risk and Safety Services.
Students: Student essential travel is defined as that which is necessary to meet a graduation requirement and which is not possible to be postponed.
To request approval to engage in essential travel, students should contact in writing the Dean of their respective division. The Dean of the relevant division will confer with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the travel is deemed essential, the Dean will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval. The CP/EVC may consult with the AVC of Risk and Safety Services.
Deans (of the disciplinary divisions, Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies) are responsible for ensuring that students are aware of this requirement, and Department Chairs and Institute/Organized Research Unit directors are responsible for ensuring that their faculty and researchers and their labs are aware of and adhere to this requirement.
If travel is approved and deemed essential, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their travel before their expected departure and update this information as changes occur, before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keep the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as the coronavirus.

February 07, 2020
The potential threat of a new virus can be frightening and overwhelming, particularly with misinformation and rumors that can spread through our community and on the internet. This letter serves to update everyone with accurate information obtained from the CDC and state communicable disease specialists. 

UC Santa Cruz leaders remain in daily communication with health officials working for Santa Cruz County, the state, and the UC Office of the President. We have not had any confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases at UC Santa Cruz, and no confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County. However, there have been two confirmed cases in Santa Clara County and two cases in San Benito County. These four cases were placed in isolation immediately after arrival to the U.S., so the risk of spread of coronavirus from them has not been a concern. To date, California has had a total of six confirmed coronavirus cases, all doing well. 

UCSC Student Health Center leaders are committed to the health and wellness of the campus. We are prepared to support members of our campus community who may be impacted by the new coronavirus, including suspected or confirmed cases. We will continue to provide updates on coronavirus at ucsc.edu/coronavirus. Any significant changes to the situation will be shared immediately and broadly with our campus community. 

In accordance with the most recent public health guidance, anyone who has returned from China on or after Feb. 3, with or without symptoms of illness, should not go to work or school. They should go home and notify their health care provider. 

Persons who returned BEFORE February 3rd, and have been back for less than 14 days, and have become ill with fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their health care provider and be ready to share their travel history BEFORE arriving on site in order to make arrangements to prevent possible spread of illness to others. Students who become ill should contact the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 and ask to discuss their symptoms with a nurse. All students arriving for care at the Student Health Center are screened for their travel history and/or possible exposure to the virus. We do not have any suspected coronavirus cases at this time. UC employees can choose from a range of health care providers based on their health care plans. 

Faculty, staff and students who have returned from China BEFORE February 3rd and have no symptoms may wish to consider staying home for 14 days after they left mainland China, but it is not mandatory, and they should continue monitoring themselves for symptoms until the end of the 14 days.

As a university, we stand to support, include, and protect our diverse and international community. It is important to remember that isolating or assuming a certain racial group is carrying the disease is counterproductive and can cause unfounded suffering.

Campus community members who are experiencing discrimination or harassment on the basis of their nationality or race are encouraged to report incidents by going to help.ucsc.edu or reporthate.ucsc.edu.

For the latest information on travel warnings and UC-related updates, go to ucal.us/coronavirus. In addition, UC community members who are currently traveling on University-related business in a country designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice should plan to immediately leave the area unless their UC campus or medical center deems their travel to be essential. Risk Services units at campuses and Medical Centers can help facilitate safe departures and returns to campus as needed.Again, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before their expected departure and ensure they update this information as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of traveling abroad while keeping the UC community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as COVID-19.

UC Santa Cruz is continuing to closely monitor the coronavirus (COVID–19) situation, and we are in regular contact with local and state health officials. We are also monitoring the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and relevant authorities closely. Clearly, the situation is changing daily, and we are prepared to take all proper precautions to protect our community and make sure everyone feels safe.
To date, there are no reported coronavirus cases at UC Santa Cruz or in Santa Cruz County. Three people at the UC Davis campus are currently in isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing one for COVID–19, while the other two are asymptomatic and, following CDC guidance, have not been tested.
For now, the most important thing is for you to do is stay home and seek medical care if you’re feeling sick, especially if you develop a cough or a high temperature. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831–459–2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment.
How UCSC is preparing
Student Health Center: The Student Health Center has partnered with the Santa Cruz County Health Department to receive information on any incoming travelers who have been advised to self-quarantine. The campus Office of Emergency Services has prepared a quarantine protocol for residential students who may require self-quarantine.
Containment: Students with respiratory symptoms and fever will be triaged in a separate area at Student Health Services. Any testing for COVID–19 will be coordinated with local public health officials.
Supplies: Cold and flu prevention packets that include tissues and hand sanitizer are being distributed at the Student Health Center and across campus.
Outreach and preparedness: The Student Health Center and the Office of Emergency Services are preparing outreach materials and sessions for personal and business continuity preparedness. Town halls and presentation dates will be released in the coming week.
Quarantine space: For residential students unable to go home who have been advised by public health to self-quarantine for 14 days, the university has established quarters. Individuals under self-quarantine will be provided with a private bedroom, phone-in wellness checks from medical professionals, and meal deliveries.
Prevention: Campus is preparing to distribute additional hand-sanitizing stations at numerous buildings. Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.
Academic support: Campus is exploring options for delivering education via alternative platforms to allow anyone who is ill or in self-quarantine to compete coursework remotely.
Education abroad programs: To ensure the safety of our students and faculty, the university is closely monitoring all U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control travel advisories. Programs may be postponed, cancelled, or delivered in alternative formats.
Help stop the spread: Share the facts about COVID–19 prevention and symptoms. Faculty and staff, please print and post CDC bulletins in your academic and administrative buildings.
International travel restrictions
This week, the Centers for Disease Control has added a Level 3 Travel Notice for South Korea, Italy, and Iran to the existing Level 3 Travel Notice for China. For the health and well-being of the UC community, President Janet Napolitano has expanded the UC Travel Directive to temporarily avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice. For the latest on travel warnings and UC-related updates, visit ucal.us/coronavirus.
UCSC is following CDC guidelines for decisions about travel and programming abroad.
UCSC considers any country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Advisory, “Avoid Nonessential Travel,” an elevated-risk destination. University-related student travel to those countries will be prohibited, and staff and faculty must request campus approval prior to travel.
For any country with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Advisory, “Practice Enhanced Precautions,” UCSC will alert students in the country and advocate for adoption of enhanced infection-control precautions. University-run programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine an appropriate course of action.
Spring break
COVID–19 is present in a number of countries. Students, faculty, and staff making spring break travel plans should visit the US State Department Travel Advisories and CDC “Coronavirus 2019 Information for Travel” websites for up-to-date travel advisories.
Planning for summer travel abroad
Although we do not know whether the Level 3 Travel Health Advisories for China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran will remain in place over the summer, we strongly suggest UCSC students, faculty, or staff planning to participate in or lead organized programs of study, work or research in those countries this summer make alternate plans. We are examining contingency plans for students who might be required to stay on campus this summer including meaningful programming opportunities and housing.
Updates on COVID–19
As of Feb. 28, there are a total of 34 positive cases in California: 24 are from repatriation flights. The other 10 confirmed cases include seven that are travel-related, one due to person-to-person exposure from a very close contact (a spouse) and two from unknown sources. These numbers align with the CDC. Approximately 200 people have been tested to date.
The health risk from novel coronavirus to the general public remains low at this time, according to state health officials. While COVID–19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate. From the international data the state has, of those who have tested positive for COVID–19, approximately 80 percent do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization. There have been no confirmed deaths related to COVID–19 in the United States. The state is assessing the situation as it evolves.
Academic impact and support
While health and safety are our primary concerns, we remain mindful of the academic challenges students face as more travel destinations and study-abroad programs are affected by the spread of the virus. Academic units are encouraged to make their best efforts to support students whose quarters may be disrupted due to coronavirus concerns so that they can complete their coursework.
We also are aware that staff, post-doctoral fellows and faculty may find their work disrupted due to travel restrictions, and we urge supervisors to be flexible and generous in establishing alternative responsibilities.
Prevention and protection
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners also are effective.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue away.
Put used tissues in the trash immediately.
Avoid close contact with sick people.
If you get sick with a fever and respiratory symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Maintain your immune system by getting plenty of rest, sleep and a nutritious balanced diet.",1232,cal,2

As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread, we are doing everything possible to protect the health of our students, faculty, and staff. The safety and well-being of our community is our number one priority. Campus experts have been communicating often and broadly about ways that the community can take precautions (see the most recent update here). We are also preparing for potential situations in which members of our campus community become ill or need to be placed in isolation or quarantine. We remain committed to ensuring that our students continue to receive a top-quality education, along with support services and extracurricular experiences, while protecting the health of our faculty, staff, and students. 
We write to share best practices for instructors and academic units, for the educational benefit of our students. The goal of this preparation and planning is to minimize educational impacts should participation in coursework become difficult for health reasons for academic staff or students. If you encounter challenges, please consult with your department/program chair or college provost. Units should work closely with their dean’s office.
The CDC recommends that anyone who is sick not attend class in person. As such, instructors should consider how to accommodate students who may not be able to attend class in person, due to illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions: 
If feasible, arrange for lecture capture/webcasting of your course. 


Consider alternatives for instruction and student engagement (such as Zoom) that allow remote participation and assessment, including pre-recording lectures that can be accessed in the event the class cannot meet interactively. We acknowledge that this is not possible for some classes, such as studio or lab classes.


We strongly recommend adjusting course policies related to class and examination attendance so as not to penalize students who become ill or are placed under quarantine. Inflexibility regarding attendance will increase the chances of others in the class and on campus being infected.


For assistance with the items involving educational technology, please contact the Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC). The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL) has posted a resource folder for instructors relevant to teaching during unplanned events/maintaining educational continuity, including modifications to design and delivery of courses. 
Instructors are encouraged to make class resources available to their department or course sponsoring agency, in case they are physically unable to continue teaching due to illness or quarantine.
Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook, either in the Canvas learning management system or through another mechanism that provides access to department staff, so that if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are under quarantine, there is an up-to-date record of coursework.


Consider establishing a plan for submission and grading of final exams and papers, and for the submission of course grades, should the instructor or other course staff be unable to work if ill or quarantined.


Publish all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, reading lists) on Canvas, so that students can access them remotely even if unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine. Alternatively, if the course has a separate website or other online resources, provide a link to it from Canvas, and ensure that your department can get access to it in case you are unable to continue instruction. If you are using Google Drive to store your course documents, consider giving your departmental staff and Chair access to your drive.


Give your department access to webcasts of course lectures, particularly for regularly taught courses, so that these can be used in instances where an instructor is unable to deliver lectures.


Academic administrators (deans, chairs, directors, and provosts) are encouraged to make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined.  
Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or students who had arranged for accommodation. The Disability Resource Center is available to answer instructor questions regarding continuing to provide accommodations to students who qualify for them. 


Discuss these issues and approaches with the faculty in your unit, and work with each to develop plans for academic resilience by taking the steps outlined above or through other approaches.


Work with Summer Session to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support the academic advancement of students from abroad who cannot go home during summer 2020. 


Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already. Make faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed to support current courses.


Help arrange for key courses to undergo lecture capture in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, and beyond, so as to provide the greatest coverage in future times of need. 


Thank you for taking steps to ensure the educational resilience of our campus and to support our students’ academic success in the face of the challenges posed by COVID-19.
We understand that this is a stressful time for students and faculty alike. We are here to support you as we navigate this situation together. If you need further assistance or have ideas to strengthen our educational resilience protocols, please reach out any time.",924,cal,3

However, the UCSC affiliates did not have direct contact with this person, are not considered close contacts by the local health department, and remain at low risk for potential exposure.
Continuing with our cautious approach, the two UCSC affiliates will remain in self-quarantine for 14 days or until they are able to be tested and receive a negative result. Other than these two affiliates, Genomics Institute staff can return to work at the Delaware Avenue facility.
There is currently no recommendation to extend self-quarantine to additional occupants of the Delaware Avenue facility who were not present at the CZI facility last week. Therefore, the remaining Genomics Institute staff can return to work at the Delaware Avenue facility.

UC Santa Cruz leaders continue to closely monitor the dynamic COVID-19 (coronavirus) situation and are in regular communication with local and state health officials. Your health and wellbeing are our number one priority and we are doing all we can to support a safe and healthy environment for everyone in our campus community. This update provides information on preparedness activities and recent changes to travel restrictions, which are particularly important in consideration of the upcoming spring break. This information, along with additional guidance and resources, can be found on the UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 (coronavirus) web page.
Preparedness and Prevention
To date, no one in Santa Cruz County or at UC Santa Cruz has tested positive for COVID-19. 
I do want the campus to be aware that earlier this week we learned that two staff members with the Genomics Institute were at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) offices in Redwood City on February 27 and may have been exposed to COVID-19 through a contract worker on the Redwood City CZI site that day. That contract worker has now tested positive for COVID-19, but analysis has determined that neither of the two Genomics Institute staff are among the seven individuals who had close enough contact with the infected contract worker for direct transmission of the virus.
Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, both UCSC employees have self-quarantined and are pursuing options for testing. We continue to believe that there is minimal risk to our employees.
Separately, one student receiving medical care off campus was tested on March 4 for COVID-19 after experiencing respiratory symptoms. That test came back negative on March 5. Out of an abundance of caution, UC Santa Cruz moved the student’s two roommates into quarantine housing after learning about the testing. With the negative test result, those two students have returned to their on-campus residence.
For now, the most important thing for you to do is stay home, rest and avoid contact with others if you are not feeling well. You should call your medical provider if you develop a cough, difficulty breathing, or a fever. Anyone with these symptoms AND recent travel to China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, or Japan should call their healthcare provider in advance and make arrangements to be evaluated. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment. Please visit the Student Health Center website for general health information.
Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.
Travel Restrictions and Registration
President Napolitano issued a letter on March 5 further restricting international travel in accordance with recent CDC guidance. This directive expands the existing travel restriction for CDC Level 3 countries (China, South Korea, Italy, Iran) to include CDC Level 2 countries (Japan). University travel between these countries and UC Santa Cruz is prohibited without prior approval from campus Risk Services.
Any travelers from a CDC Level 3 country, whether traveling for university or personal reasons, must self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. The UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services will assist with quarantine logistics for any on-campus residents and serve as a point of contact for those quarantining off campus. 
All international university travel must be registered in one of two ways:
Use the Connexxus system to make reservations. This will automatically add your travel to the travel registry.


If you do not use Connexxus for reservations, register your travel through the UC Away system. 


If you are planning to travel for spring break, check the CDC and State Department travel advisories prior to departure. If you travel to a CDC Level 3 country, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. Before returning to campus, undergraduate residential students who have recently traveled to these regions should contact their college’s senior director in order to identify an appropriate quarantine facility. Because of the restrictions on returning to the US, and the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation, international travel is not advised.
Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency Update
Santa Cruz County Health Services, in coordination with the California Department of Public Health, is the lead agency for ensuring an effective communitywide response. The campus will follow guidance from Santa Cruz County and the California Department of Public Health with respect to cancellation of group events or classes. At this time, given the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in Santa Cruz County, UC Santa Cruz is not planning to cancel classes or suspend or modify operations. 
In an effort to secure more support and resources in managing any potential coronavirus cases, the county Health Services Agency declared a local health emergency.
According to the county, the declaration will empower it to:
More effectively respond to COVID-19,


Seek and utilize mutual aid,


Potentially obtain reimbursement, and


Ensure that the county’s health professionals and other local stakeholders have all the necessary tools and powers at their disposal.


Support Resources
This continues to be a rapidly changing situation. No doubt, some of you may be feeling anxious and concerned. Students in need of support can reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services. For faculty and staff, the Employee Assistance Program can provide personal counseling and support.
We are closely following the guidance of our state and nation's top health leaders to ensure our response will support the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.

Over the past few weeks, we have all learned of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID–19) to locations around the globe, various cities in the US, and in neighboring counties. Santa Cruz County learned of its first confirmed case of COVID–19 on Saturday, March 7; this person is not affiliated with the UCSC campus. We expect that the number of confirmed cases will continue to climb with more widespread testing. Understandably, this possibility leads to elevated worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in higher-risk populations.
I want to acknowledge the uncertainty, concern and worry that this virus and its consequences have created for so many in our community. Though there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus, the first confirmed case could very well happen on campus at any time. We want to be as prepared as possible so we can move quickly should we need to.
Campus Status
The campus continues to remain open and operational. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID–19 have been reported at UCSC, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully as we assess the local impact. After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low for our campus. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend normal instructional activity.
To ensure that we are prepared, I am calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that we will need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually in the near future.
You may have seen the memo to instructors advising that they begin planning ways to offer course content and lectures outside of the classroom and predominantly online. To this point, the appropriate Academic Senate committees (Committee on Educational Policy, Committee on Courses of Instruction, and Graduate Council) agree that instructors may switch to Zoom-only with approval of the department chair (or equivalent head of the course sponsoring agency). Where practical, supervisors and managers may allow employees to work remotely. These are measures we can scale up quickly and broadly across campus.
We are aware that a small number of other universities, with different local circumstances, have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our local situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the local health officials and UC Office of the President. While we are not ending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we do understand the value of increased “social distancing” as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus. If the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings.
Should UCSC need to move to a hybrid or completely virtual instruction model, on-campus housing will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases within on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials should it become necessary. Dining services will also continue to serve students with meal plans.
This situation is fluid, and it could change very quickly in the Santa Cruz area, requiring that we change course at a moment’s notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on our COVID–19 webpage or the Office of the President’s COVID–19 webpage.
Travel Considerations
The University of California revised its instructions on travel on March 5th and further restrictions are anticipated as additional cases of COVID–19 are confirmed. Please consider the potential for additional countries to be added to the restricted travel list which could result in difficulties getting back into the US. Travelers should be prepared or arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return from a restricted jurisdiction or if you are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID–19. Consult our COVID–19 webpage for the most up-to-date information on travel advice.
Your Health and Wellness
Finally and most importantly, it is crucial for all members of the UC Santa Cruz community to heed the recommendations for preventative care which have the greatest likelihood of protecting us as individuals, as well as the larger community, by diminishing the chances of transmission of the virus:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, or, as an alternative, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Stay home if you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands.
In addition, it is recommended that people practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu.
Thank you for doing your part to protect our community. Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.",1017,cal,3

As outlined in a previous campus communication, UCSC is continuing to take precautionary steps to prepare the campus for scenarios where COVID-19 makes large gatherings unsafe. As a result, we are advising instructors to prepare for the possible suspension of Winter quarter in-person instruction and in-person finals. Many instructors have already been using tools such as webcasting, Zoom, and Canvas to deliver instruction, and we ask those instructors who have not been doing so to consider how you might modify instruction in the event that classes can no longer meet in person. Comprehensive information is available listing campus technological solutions and adaptations for instruction.
Final Exams

For Winter 2020, all instructors should prepare now for at least some students to be unable to attend the final exam in person. The health and safety of our community is our top priority, and we need to ensure that a sick student does not feel compelled to come to campus, which could pose a significant public health risk.

In addition, instructors should have a contingency plan in place should Winter quarter in-person final exams be suspended altogether.

Here are some principles to help guide instructors:
The recent Senate guidance on changes to a syllabus recommends that “when making adjustments, faculty should make every effort to teach in a way that continues to support students in achieving the learning goals of the course, even as we recognize that some course elements may need to change due to extreme unplanned events such as campus closures.”
Focus on learning rather than testing. The priority in an emergency is not to replicate traditional in-person tests but to provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate and solidify their learning.
Options to demonstrate learning in lieu of traditional exams might include online exams (administered through Canvas), other forms of take home exams, project based learning, short student-made videos expressing learning (where appropriate), and a range of other alternative assessments.
Online proctoring may be available by request. Please email online@ucsc.edu for more details. Due to high demand for this service among institutions around the country, the availability of online proctoring is limited, but UCSC will continue to work to make it available to interested instructors. Arrangements typically need to be made at least a week in advance. Campus resources may be available to cover the per-student costs. This will be discussed when contact is made with online@ucsc.edu.
If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student’s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete. Instructors should be clear as to what needs to be done within the next quarter.
For take-home examinations and papers, rather than trying to eliminate cheating in at home environments, you may want to try the alternative of offering a different style of assessment and messaging about academic integrity. Cheating is extremely difficult to eliminate. In-person exams do not always translate directly into remote environments. Designing assessments that make it difficult for students to cheat may be more practical than trying to stop cheating. For instance, open book exams that are time limited may make it less likely that students will cheat. Timed exams through Canvas or email that are sent out and returned at a specific time make it difficult for students to consult a lot of outside sources. Canvas can allow an instructor to restrict the IP address of the user. Finally, Canvas allows the use of quiz banks, so that questions can be shuffled, making it difficult for students to reliably collaborate, especially in timed environments.
Remember that students who have DRC accommodations will still need reasonable accommodations in alternative teaching and assessment environments. Consult directly with the DRC if you have questions about accommodations.
Have a plan in place and discuss it with your students in the days prior to the exam if at all possible. “If campus is operating as normal, then X. If you are sick and unable to attend an in-person exam, then Y. If in-person final exams are cancelled, then Z.” Talk to students about how you may have to modify your original grading plan. Be transparent about what that will look like.
The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning and ITS have posted instructions and suggestions for instructors who need to modify examinations, assessments, and feedback and/or use technology for instruction due to present circumstances. Additional online resources have just been developed for instructional resilience during the COVID 19 outbreak (and other unplanned events). CITL, FITC, and Online Education staff will be available in the coming days to consult individually with instructors both about finishing Winter 2020 courses and planning for possible contingencies in Spring. An email to citl@ucsc.edu, fitc@ucsc.edu, or online@ucsc.edu will connect you with staff, who will route your question to the appropriate person in their own or another unit.
Remember that some students may not have access to a computer or to high-speed internet at home. If in-person classes are suspended, instructors should not require students to come to campus to access the internet or other facilities. Instructors should consider if there are ways to allow students to complete assignments without internet access, such as having students do some forms of work and take a picture with their phones, sending it in on the cellular network. Note: for proctored online examinations, high-speed internet access is essential.

Good communication is key
It is important to recognize that many students have significant anxiety around assessment and that all students are likely to be experiencing higher than normal levels of stress associated with the strike/protest and COVID-19. Clear and positive communication with students about the event and how you will handle assessments can help alleviate anxiety.
Avoid changing the format of the assessment multiple times if possible. If you need to change the format or date, be transparent about why and what information you are using to make the decision and when you plan to let students know the plan. Acknowledge that the situation may be less than ideal but that you are focused on providing the best learning experience possible under the circumstances.
Keep any Teaching Assistants, Readers, or other instructional staff apprised of planned changes. Communicate your expectations and clarify their roles.
If able, you might ask students for their feedback about possible alternatives for assessment. Giving students the chance to weigh in on these decisions can help them feel more in control of the situation.
Unplanned events can make assessment of student work challenging. Maintaining a focus on learning outcomes can make decisions about what mode of assessment to use clearer. And finally, good communication with students throughout is essential to help alleviate stress and help students maintain focus on their learning in the face of uncertainty.

Thank you for your assistance in this dynamic environment. We appreciate your diligence as we all work together to ensure our campus is prepared and safe.

URGENT: UC Santa Cruz suspending in-person classes in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive

Today we are implementing new campus actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. Importantly, there are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time; however, we recently learned that a second case has been identified in Santa Cruz County and the number of cases in neighboring Santa Clara County continues to rise. As local, national, and global public health recommendations increasingly shift to efforts to mitigate transmission by social distancing, UC Santa Cruz is proactively taking steps to protect our campus community.

In our assessment of the current situation, we believe that this is the best action for our campus and the broader Santa Cruz community. These measures are effective beginning Wednesday, March 11, and will remain in place through the first week of the spring quarter. A decision on what will happen after April 3 and beyond for the spring quarter will occur at a later date, based on the latest coronavirus information available. Timely updates will be emailed and posted on the UCSC COVID-19 website.

INSTRUCTION
Beginning Wednesday, March 11, lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminars will be offered through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom) to reduce face-to-face interactions as much as possible.
Lab and studio courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate can continue to meet in person where necessary. 
In-person winter quarter final exams will be conducted via alternate means - not in person. Instructors will be communicating with their students this week about alternative plans for assessment on a course-by-course basis.
The first week of spring quarter, Monday, March 30, though Friday, April 3, will also follow this model with lecture courses and discussion sections delivered remotely.
EVENTS
Per CDC guidance, crowds should be avoided. As such, all campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 50 attendees (based on county guidance) will be canceled or postponed. These include events put on by the administration or academic departments and scheduled to take place through Friday, April 3. Further guidance will be forthcoming regarding student organization events.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
CAMPUS OPERATIONS

The campus is not closing. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations, including student housing and dining, health services and research support operations, will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified as conditions change.

While the campus will remain open, we encourage all students who are able to do so return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. We know this is not possible for all students, however reducing the number of people on campus will increase the safety of all, and allow those who remain on campus to better practice social distancing. Additional guidance about the spring quarter will be provided prior to April 3 based on the latest available coronavirus information.

Some limitations in operations and services may arise as managers may be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided shortly. In addition, a message outlining additional adjustments to campus operations, events and travel will be issued shortly.

We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice may be challenging and disruptive, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. The safety of our campus community is our highest priority. We are grateful to the community members throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles.

We will continue to update you on this issue with the latest information on our COVID-19 webpage or the Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage.

Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your families and any concerned parties.",846,cal,3

Earlier today, the Chancellor announced new actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. In recent days we have seen the continued spread of COVID-19 around the world and now here in Santa Cruz County. We can expect that confirmed cases will continue to grow in our region and in our campus community. There are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time.
The public health guidance we are receiving continues to emphasize not only good personal hygiene practices, but also minimizing close contact among groups of people, as means of restraining the spread of COVID-19. We are placing constraints on large public events at UC Santa Cruz, and now we are taking steps regarding course instruction.
For the final three (3) days of the winter quarter, beginning Wednesday March 11, through the first week of spring quarter, Friday April 3, we will be suspending most in-person classes and will be offering all lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminar instruction through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom). Wherever possible, instruction should be carried out through Zoom meetings. In addition, instructors should provide assigned course materials, including the instructor’s lecture materials, on Canvas.
During this period laboratory and studio classes can continue to meet in person where necessary. We do encourage, for these courses, minimizing in-person meetings as appropriate and whenever possible. 
To the fullest extent possible, final exams will be moving to remote instruction formats. Alternative arrangements must be made for any Winter quarter final exams that were scheduled to be administered in person, such as delivering via a remote format, restructuring as a take-home exam, or replacing with a final project.  
We recognize that this is a significant adjustment for instructors, staff, and students. Departments and instructors should work together to determine the most appropriate solutions for finishing courses and assigning grades. The March 9 message to instructors provides guidance on online instruction and assessment, and instructors are strongly encouraged to provide students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge at the end of the quarter. Above all, departments and faculty are asked to put student health and success first in their decision making. In that spirit, advising, tutoring, and supplemental instruction should move to Zoom format to the fullest extent possible.
For final exams and end-of-quarter assessment of student performance, instructors may also need to consider options such as: electronic submission of final papers, projects, and take-home examinations; and proctored online examinations.
If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student’s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete. Instructors should be clear as to what needs to be done within the next quarter to remove the incomplete. The March 6 Academic Senate message noted that instructors may not be able to satisfy all the learning outcomes of their course, and that student assessment may not be in accordance with the grading plan laid out in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. If necessary, faculty should consult with their department chairs in determining the most appropriate actions to take. 
We are committed to providing support to help instructors in this effort. Please consult the March 9 message to instructors for specific information about available resources for remote instruction and final exams. We encourage all instructors to email students in their courses immediately to let them know their course plans. 
As instructors plan for Spring quarter, course materials of all types should be placed on Canvas. Laboratory and studio courses for which remote instruction is not possible can meet in person, although we continue to advise minimizing in-person meetings. More guidance on Spring quarter teaching will be provided as soon as possible.
In closing, we thank you for all that you are doing to support our campus community—and especially our students—during this challenging period. Thank you, all, for your commitment to the well-being of our community.",704,cal,3
Santa Cruz,10-Mar-2020,"Operational changes in response to COVID-19 virus
To: UC Santa Cruz campus community
From: Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services
March 10, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
As outlined earlier this morning by Chancellor Larive, UC Santa Cruz is making adjustments to the delivery of classes and the administration of final exams in response to the COVID-19 virus. While we do not have a confirmed case on campus, there are confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County, and we are working to be proactive in supporting the health and safety of our campus community.

In addition to the adjustments in instruction and final-exam administration, and consistent with consultation with our campus emergency management experts, we are making the following adjustments and recommendations related to campus operations. This guidance applies to all campus locations. There could be additional guidance that applies to locations outside of Santa Cruz County should local circumstances warrant it. Note that this guidance is based on the situation as we know it today. Some recommendations may adjust as conditions change. Continue to check for online updates. In addition, questions can be sent to publicaffairs@ucsc.edu. Finally, we will be hosting online town halls to provide further guidance and answer questions you might have about the campus response. Information about those online town halls will be forthcoming.

Sanitation
We are proactively implementing a plan to provide a higher level of sanitation for campus public areas such as building entries, lobbies, restrooms, classrooms, teaching laboratories, libraries, dining halls and other spaces where a large number of people are present or pass through daily. In addition, we are working to expand the locations and number of hand-sanitizing stations across campus. We are also expanding educational information posted across campus outlining the actions all members of the community can take to promote sanitary environments.

Telecommuting
Where feasible, and until at least April 3, supervisors and managers should encourage telecommuting. For positions where telecommuting is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family. To ensure staff do not feel compelled to come to work while ill due to a concern about a lack of sick leave balance, UC has issued new guidance on paid leave and remote working provisions. This guidance can be found online.

Travel
Effective immediately, we are recommending the following adjustments to campus travel taking place through April 3. These changes may be expanded beyond that date should conditions warrant.

All non-essential business-related staff and faculty travel that is scheduled to take place prior to April 3 should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.

Those who are overseeing university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancelation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, modality of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.

In Chancellor Larive’s message, she suggested students who are able to should return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. Students unable to travel or return home during this time due to conditions in their destination or due to other health considerations where travel poses a risk may remain on campus. There will be dining options available, though some services might be adapted as conditions change.

In addition to the travel guidance outlined here, the previously communicated travel directives outlined by the UC Office of the President remain in effect.

Events taking place on campus or sponsored by campus
For all events scheduled to take place prior to April 3, we recommend the following:
Cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance over 50. This number is consistent with guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.
Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled. Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from Chancellor Larive and iCPEVC Kletzer.
This event guidance could be extended past April 3 if conditions warrant. In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled for March and April where event characteristics match those outlined above.

Campus meetings
Where possible, campus departments should utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel on campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancelations.

Research business continuity
Principal officers should ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations. The Office of Research has been working to support this and is engaged with researchers to assist in this effort.

In addition to the items outlined above, our campus emergency response team, in partnership with units across campus, continues to work daily to ensure our response plans are robust in the event we have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on campus or face escalation of illness in our city and county. Our primary focus is ensuring we can support the health and safety of our campus community.

Thank you for your support as we undertake these operational changes.",994,cal,3

Working during this unusual time in response to the COVID–19 emergency requires flexibility and modifications to our normal practices. This message addresses several temporary changes we are making to our regular human resources policies to ensure we are maximizing the safety of our community members while continuing to deliver on our educational and research mission.
Principal officers have been asked to provide guidance to their teams that is in alignment with the functions of their respective divisions. Our campus is also following system-wide guidance from the Office of the President (OP) (Guidance from OP) that is described below.
We need to maintain many regular operations while much of our instruction is being transitioned to an online format. Your support is critical to providing increased “social distancing” and other healthy practices. Modifications to an employee’s regular work location, assignments, and schedule should be considered on a case by case basis by the responsible manager.
These five (5) important temporary system-wide emergency provisions now apply at our campus until further notice:
Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID–19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible, as determined by the supervisor. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID–19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave. Managers may determine which positions to designate, provided that all healthcare workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.
Academic appointees who do not accrue sick leave but who are eligible for paid medical leave under APM 710–11 or a collective bargaining agreement may request medical leave for their own illness. For other COVID–19 related absences and for those who have exhausted medical leave options, appointees will receive up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave. Requests for medical leave and administrative leave should be directed to the Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator.
Implementing these five (5) provisions requires managerial judgment, discretion and flexibility depending on the unit’s functional priorities and often based on factors present in a specific case.
We encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all employees, including student employees, in caring for their health – and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID–19 – while enabling them to continue performing their important work. Our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to work on site.
In situations where work can temporarily be performed from home or an alternate location, we encourage managers and employees to work together to identify opportunities to allow employees to work remotely. For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented, and student workers), managers and employees should work together to develop a remote work plan to complete special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training. In developing a remote work plan, managers should be mindful of employees who may need alternate work stations set up.
Student employees are not eligible for FMLA. However, student employees are eligible for the fourteen (14) days of administrative leave if they cannot work remotely, self isolate or are exhibiting symptoms of the COVID–19.
Regarding travel, please be conservative in determining travel that is required. It is better to avoid travel than it is to travel. Many UC systemwide meetings are now being canceled or changed to Zoom in order to decrease the need for business travel. Please do not let concerns about non-refundable deposits, etc. lead to travel decisions that put people in more susceptible situations.
Please continue to provide the empathy and patience needed to deal with staff who express concerns. Also, find ways to thank those who have roles requiring them to work onsite. The campus is not closed. We still have people who live on campus, need to deal with facility issues, need to maintain labs and conduct research, and a variety of other duties.
Subject to the needs of the University, managers should consider flexible work arrangements such as having employees work on-site with reduced shifts (fewer hours or fewer days). This can be coupled with remote work assignments for the time not spent on-site.
We appreciate the consideration that has been demonstrated by our community as we continue to work through this unpredictable situation. Campus and UC leaders are continuing to meet daily to think through these issues and are preparing to take the necessary measures to protect the health of our employees. Please contact your Employee Relations Analyst in SHR or your Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator for guidance or questions about these topics.

I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections is now extended to the full spring quarter. We also will continue with remote final exams at the end of spring quarter, June 8-12.
Since I last wrote to you on Tuesday, additional information has emerged about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its rapid spread. It is a crisis of enormous scale and human impact, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We made this difficult decision to extend remote instruction following consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.
This does not mean campus is closing for spring quarter. Campus will remain open. Most support services for students, including counseling, advising, and tutoring, will be delivered via Zoom. Over the next two weeks, departments and instructors will evaluate the extent to which laboratory and studio courses can be offered in person with appropriate social distancing or whether they can transition to remote instruction. Additional guidance will be provided about these courses by March 20, and no in-person laboratory or studio courses will meet prior to April 6.
Students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through the spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Student housing, dining, health services, the library, and research support operations will remain open, although there will be changes in most operations and services. 
Should you wish to cancel your housing for the entire spring quarter, you can complete the online Intent to Vacate form. (A link to the form will be emailed to residential students soon). If you remove all of your belongings from your housing and return your key by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee.
New details about this virus are emerging constantly, and we are updating our campus COVD-19 website regularly. The site includes sections on Health Services, Instruction, Campus Operations, Telecommuting, Events, Student Services, Travel, and International Studies. Please use the site as a resource about the virus and how to protect yourself against it. It is also where you will find all of the latest information on how our campus is responding to the outbreak. The UC Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage is also a good resource.
I know the measures we have taken are difficult, especially for students. I regret that this period in your lives is being filled with so much uncertainty. Our highest priority must be to keep everyone on our campus safe. 
To our faculty and staff, I thank you for your flexibility and willingness to roll up your sleeves as we do our best for our students. You are doing extremely valuable work while undoubtedly also experiencing your own anxiety. Though we do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on our campus, there are currently seven confirmed cases in the county, and it was announced last night that all Santa Cruz County public schools will shut down next week, March 16-20. I understand the stress this puts on many of you. 
At the same time, I am confident that together we will reach the other side of this upheaval, and I look forward to the time when our community will again be able to come together in person. The preventative measures being taken by universities, by cities and counties, and by the business community are critical to successfully confronting this health emergency. Our best course of action is to undertake aggressive public measures to slow the spread of the virus. The steps we are taking at UCSC are intended to do just that.",904,cal,3

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
As outlined earlier today by Chancellor Larive, remote instruction for lecture and discussion sections, originally announced through April 3, will extend for the entire spring quarter.
Even with the remote instruction, the campus remains open. Though the campus will remain open through spring quarter, a variety of services have been or will be adjusted to promote social distancing to protect the health and safety of the campus community. As of this morning, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases on our campus; however, there are now seven confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and 66 in neighboring Santa Clara County. The proximity of cases around us means we must remain vigilant. 
In addition to the extension of remote instruction through spring quarter, we are making additional adjustments and recommendations regarding campus operations. Many of the operational changes outlined March 10 are now being expanded. The changes are detailed below. This guidance applies to all campus locations. There could be additional guidance that applies to campus locations outside of Santa Cruz County should local circumstances warrant. Note that this guidance is based on the situation as we know it today. Some recommendations may adjust as conditions change. Continue to check for online updates available at our campus COVID-19 webpage. In addition, questions can be sent to publicaffairs@ucsc.edu. 
Sanitation
We continue to be proactive in our efforts to promote higher levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas across campus. It remains vital that everyone on campus assist by taking several actions, such as social distancing when possible; thorough hand washing to prevent the spread of disease; avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth; refraining from shaking hands; washing hands thoroughly before and after traveling from place to place; and cleaning work surfaces in personal work stations.  
Alternative work arrangements
Managers and supervisors should continue to implement temporary remote work arrangements to the greatest extent possible. For positions where remote work is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family. In addition, managers and supervisors should identify methods to adjust workspaces and work methods in ways that can promote social distancing. Additional guidance, including specifics on leave options, can be found in the message sent out on March 11 as well as at the UC Santa Cruz telecommuting guidance page. 
Travel
We are extending previously communicated guidance on travel. The following adjustments will now apply to travel taking place through the end of the spring quarter. Should conditions warrant it, we might lift these restrictions prior to that date.
All nonessential business-related staff and faculty travel scheduled to take place in spring quarter should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.


Those who oversee university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancellation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, mode of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.

In the chancellor’s message, she communicated that students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees, if applicable, if they decide to move out of campus housing. Specifics on refunds and applicable dates were communicated in Chancellor Larive’s message. Students who wish to move out of campus housing for the entire spring quarter must complete the online Intent to Vacate form, which is being sent out to residents shortly. 
For those remaining on campus, dining options will be available, though some services might be adapted or limited as conditions change.
In addition to the travel guidance outlined here, the previously communicated travel directives outlined by the UC Office of the President remain in effect. 
On-campus events, campus-sponsored events 
For all events scheduled to take place through the end of April, the following should apply:
Postpone or cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance of more than 50. This number is consistent with guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host as well as university hosted events on off-campus locations.


For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.


Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be postponed or canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.


Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled. 


Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from the Chancellor and interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.


Though the above guidance applies to already scheduled events taking place prior to the end of April, sponsors should review all events currently scheduled in spring quarter to assess whether additional postponements or cancelations are necessary. Individuals with questions about contracts for currently scheduled events can contact the Office of Campus Counsel for guidance.  
In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled to take place during spring quarter where event characteristics match those outlined above. This restriction could be lifted if conditions warrant.
Discussions on how to manage commencement are underway and will be communicated soon.
Campus meetings
Where possible, campus departments are strongly advised to utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel within the campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancellations.
Research business continuity
The Office of Research has provided online resources outlining guidance on a variety of topics. One primary consideration for principal officers remains the need to ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations. 
Our campus emergency response team continues to work with units across campus to ensure our response is robust and we are able to support the health and safety of our campus community. As this situation is continually evolving, additional guidance will be sent out as operational needs adjust. 
Thank you to everyone for your efforts during these challenging times.",1176,cal,3
Santa Cruz,13-Mar-2020,"Guidance for Responding to Reports of COVID-19 exposures and/or positive test results
To: UC Santa Cruz Managers and Supervisors
From: Grace McClintock, AVP, Academic Personnel Office; Steve Stein, AVC, Staff Human Resources; and Lisa Ehret, Director of Emergency Management
March 13, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
In the past week, the Santa Cruz community learned of more cases of COVID–19. Additional cases were confirmed in Santa Cruz (7) and Santa Clara (more than 65) counties. One of the Santa Cruz cases involves an employee at Rio Del Mar Elementary School. County health officials are investigating all cases, and school and airport authorities are taking actions for prevention.
As we learn of more cases in our community, it is natural for everyone to feel concerned about potential exposure to someone with COVID–19, and it’s sensible to take precautions.
We write to offer guidance for when you hear from staff who are concerned about exposure to COVID–19, who are being tested for COVID–19, and/or who may have a confirmed case of COVID–19 in their close community of relatives and friends. Often when these reports are made, they come with great expectations for managers to immediately do something - for example, close an office, notify a community/department or other cohort, request that everyone be tested and so on. It is critical that as campus leaders, we take pause to act efficiently and methodically, so as not to make a misstep. The information below is designed to help managers assess the situation and identify steps to take.
As a first step, managers need to remember that medical information about individuals is protected under HIPAA and student information is protected under HIPAA and FERPA. It’s critical that information be held in confidence and that disclosures of protected information are managed within federal and University policy. We remind you to take great care to avoid unnecessarily disclosing anyone’s medical condition or other private information.
What to do if:
An employee shares information that they were exposed to someone confirmed to have COVID–19.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
Are they certain it was a confirmed case?
Was the exposure direct and close contact?
When did the exposure occur? Where?
Is the employee feeling any symptoms?
Notify the Director of Emergency Services, Lisa Ehret at (831) 234–3551 or EHS Director Lisa Wisser at (831) 212–2839‬. After discussing the circumstances with Emergency Services, you will receive support and guidance on what to do.
An employee shares information that they ‘think’ they were exposed to an individual with COVID–19 symptoms.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
What were the circumstances of the possible exposure?
Was the exposure direct and close contact? Where did this happen?
Do they know the symptoms the person was experiencing? If yes, what were they?
Is the employee feeling any symptoms?
If there is no direct evidence of a COVID–19 exposure, no further action is necessary within your unit. However, please notify the Office of Emergency Services of this event, oes@ucsc.edu.
An employee shares that they are being tested for COVID–19.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
What were the circumstances of the possible exposure?
When and where did the exposure occur?
Remind the employee about the support available.
Notify Director of Emergency Management, Lisa Ehret, (831) 234–3551 or EHS Director Lisa Wisser at (831) 212–2839. After discussing the circumstances with Emergency Services, you may be advised to:
Receive and forward a campus advisory communication to your unit. The advisory may include directions regarding remote operations or other instructions. The content for this communication will be provided by Emergency Services.
As a manager, ensure your team has the resources necessary for remote operations. For essential operations that cannot be performed remotely, assign members who have not been exposed.
Emergency Services will provide guidance with respect to issues related to self-quarantine, isolation, telecommuting, etc.

Note: Emergency Services will coordinate closely with the campus Critical Incident Management Team (CIMT) inclusive of EH&S and Student Health Center experts who are in consultation and coordination with Santa Cruz County Health.
SCENARIOS:
Q. An employee came to work while they were sick. This event raised concerns by members of the department. Should I direct the office to work remotely?
If it was observed that the ill colleague was showing signs of fever, cough or shortness of breath, then managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave. Managers may determine which positions to designate to work from home; however, all healthcare workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.
An employee, their child or a member of their household had an interaction with someone who is now showing signs of COVID–19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath). How shall I respond?
Unless the person has a confirmed case of COVID–19, no action is needed.",1087,cal,3

Dear Residential Student and Campus Community members,
Dining Services continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving COVID–19 situation. Given today’s declaration by Gov. Gavin Newsom regarding limitations of restaurant seating and expansion of social distancing we have made shifts to our operation delivery plan for the week of March 16–20, 2020 in an effort to keep our patrons safely fed.
Starting Monday, March 16th, several operational changes will be in effect. The following facilities will all maintain their normal operating schedules, barring unforeseen shortages in staffing availability, but will be implementing changes to delivery as outlined below. Please regularly check the UCSC Dining website for updates.
Cowell Dining Hall
Colleges 9/10 Dining Hall
Rachel Carson Dining Hall
PERK at Baskin Engineering
At this time all other Dining Hall and Dining Retail locations are expected to remain closed:
Crown and Porter Dining Halls
Stevenson Coffee House
Oakes Cafe
College Eight Cafe
Banana Joe’s
Terra Fresca Fresca Restaurant and Coffee Bar
PERK Carts at Earth and Marine Sciences (EMS) and the Physical Sciences Building (PSB)
What’s shifting with how patrons may get their meals?
All meals must be taken “to go” from the Dining facility.
No more than 50 patrons will be permitted to enter the facility at one time.
You are encouraged to maintain a 6-foot social distance radius from the next person waiting in line so as to minimize any unnecessary exposure.
Upon entry you are encouraged to sign up for the Eco Box program which allows you to use and return your box to be washed for reuse by another patron in the dining hall. No fee will be assessed for utilizing this program. Compostable “To go” boxes will be made available for all others.
Patrons on a 5- and 7-day meal plan will not be limited to the number of to go or eco box meals they may take per day, but consideration for those who may be waiting in lines is appreciated.
Food handler gloves will be provided upon entrance and all patrons are encouraged to wear them at the self-service stations (deli, salad and dessert bars).
Dining Services staff will continue to be proactive in promoting the highest levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas.
As staffing levels or other precautions necessitate, Dining may need to continue to adjust the dining operations program and schedule throughout the week. Please stay informed of additional operational changes by checking the UCSC Dining website.
Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

Santa Cruz,16-Mar-2020,"Following a Shelter in Place Order from the county health officer, UC Santa Cruz announced changes to campus operations to further limit the spread of COVID-19.
Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer announced that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections, extended to the full spring quarter, will include all labs, studios, field research, and field study courses. The suspension of in-person instructional meetings includes doctoral and masters thesis defenses and oral examinations and all meetings of lab research groups. There will be no exemptions for in-person instructional activities.
Vice Chancellor Van Williams shared options for establishing network connectivity from off campus.

As the COVID–19 virus mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations. As communicated earlier today in a message sent by interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, all instruction, including labs and studio courses, will now be done solely via remote modalities for the entire spring quarter.
This afternoon, the Health Officer for the County of Santa Cruz issued a Shelter in Place Order and the Health Officer for the County of Santa Clara issued a Shelter in Place Order both of which are in effect through April 7. These directives mandate that people self-isolate, except to leave to provide or receive essential services, and permits the continuation of essential businesses. “Essential businesses” that can continue during this shelter in place period include educational institutions defined as:
“Educational institutions—including public and private K–12 schools, colleges, and universities—for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential functions, provided that social distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible”
In light of these latest actions, the following changes will apply to campus operations at locations in Santa Cruz County. Campus locations outside of Santa Cruz County will be making localized decisions based on guidance from local health officials and additional communications to those groups will be coming out shortly. We are moving to a reduced mode of operation through April 7, and expanding previously communicated changes to spring quarter operations. Additional changes might need to be made as the situation continues to evolve.
Though we have not had a confirmed case of COVID–19 on campus at this point, these changes are being made to support the health and safety of our campus community.
Final Examinations
Students should expect remote final examinations will be held at their scheduled time unless they hear otherwise from their instructor. Students who are not able to complete their remote final examination due to travel or technology limitations should contact their instructor to discuss options. Instructors should be in regular communication with their students regarding details surrounding the remote final examination.
Student Housing
We strongly urge students who are able to safely return to their permanent residence to do so by Sunday, March 29, and plan to remain there for the remainder of the academic year. The shelter in place orders allow for this travel. Exceptions to stay in campus housing beyond Sunday, March 29 will be made for students who meet one of the following:
do not have access to alternate housing;
have economic needs that do not enable them to return to their permanent residence;
can not relocate due to personal health or safety considerations;
have permanent residences in areas highly impacted by COVID–19;
have permanent residences that do not have the infrastructure needed to support remote learning; or
have other situations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Students who intend to vacate need to complete a form to initiate the check-out and refund processes. Students who remove all of their belongings from their campus residence and return their keys by April 5 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Students unable to move their belongings out by April 5 can work with the Housing Office to determine if alternative arrangements are available. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee. The Campus Housing Office will provide additional information for those students remaining on campus for spring via one of the exceptions listed above. Students who have questions about this process should contact their relevant Housing/Student Life Office.
Dining Services
Effective today (March 16), Dining Services has moved to a take-out only mode and has reduced the number of open dining spaces.
Campus Events
Campus events and events hosted in/on campus facilities will be canceled or postponed through the remainder of the spring quarter. Event sponsors can contact the Office of the Campus Counsel to discuss considerations for event contracts. Information on commencement will be forthcoming.
Campus Travel
All campus travel scheduled to take place before April 7 that does not comply with orders outlined in the Shelter in Place directive should be canceled or postponed. All non-essential business travel after April 7 should be canceled or postponed for the rest of the spring quarter. Principal Officers will provide guidance on any needed exceptions, though they must comply with other local and federal travel guidelines.
Employees and Leave Options
Only those employees who must be on campus to maintain critical operations should come to the campus through April 7. Principal Officers should provide guidance on the minimal on-campus operations required during this time and communicate to their staff. Guidance regarding operations after that date will be forthcoming. All others should work remotely. For those unable to work remotely, and in order to support our employees during this unprecedented time, UC President Janet Napolitano has implemented new leave guidelines as follows:
All employees shall be eligible to receive a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject to the following conditions:
All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire;
The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health;
The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time shall be prorated according to the percent of the appointment;
Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the one-time allotment of the paid administrative leave.
The paid administrative leave hours may only be used for the following purposes:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID–19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID–19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID–19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID–19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
Research Activities
The Office of Research has been coordinating research continuity planning across divisions. Additional information is available online. Principal Officers can provide division-specific guidance on how research should be handled during the shelter in place.
Planned Power Outage
The planned power outage scheduled to take place during spring break in order to connect the new PV array at the East Remote lot will be delayed to a later date.
Libraries
McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library will be open on Tuesday, March 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Both libraries will be closed on Wednesday, March 18 and will remain closed until April 7.
Bookstore
The bookstore will be closed to walk-in shopping. Online orders can be picked up at the will call window. The Express Store will remain open but will follow stringent social distancing guidelines and limit the number of individuals allowed inside at any time.
This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation. We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we collectively work to mitigate the spread of COVID–19.",1447,cal,3

I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections, extended to the full spring quarter, will include all labs, studios, field research, and field study courses. The suspension of in-person instructional meetings includes doctoral and masters thesis defenses and oral examinations and all meetings of lab research groups. There will be no exemptions for in-person instructional activities.

I want to acknowledge the many efforts of faculty and all instructional staff to revise curriculum and pedagogy to incorporate remote instruction into this set of instructional meetings. I know this kind of instructional redesign takes real time and effort, and I appreciate these efforts to maintain instructional continuity. Extending remote instruction comprehensively is a decision made in consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.
 
Some lab, studio and field study courses may not be readily transferable to a remote instruction format without significant impact on student learning and the ability of the course to meet approved learning outcomes. If so, this may lead program faculty to consider temporarily modifying program requirements to waive such a course as part of the degree requirements for graduating seniors. Earlier today, the relevant Academic Senate committees (CEP, CCI, and GC) released a communication with instructions to department chairs.

Library access
McHenry Library and the Science & Engineering Library will be open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. today, March 16. On March 17, 18, and 19, the two libraries will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. This move to more limited hours will reduce exposure for building occupants and increase capacity to disinfect library spaces and materials.
 
Effective Friday, March 20, McHenry Library and the Science & Engineering Library will be closed through the end of spring break. The libraries will re-open at 8 a.m. on March 30.

Dining
Starting today, Dining Services has changed its operations in an effort to keep its patrons safely fed. The changes will be in effect until at least March 20.
 
Cowell Dining Hall, Colleges 9/10 Dining Hall, Rachel Carson Dining Hall, and PERK at Baskin Engineering will keep their normal schedules. However, all will be implementing the following changes:
All meals must be taken “to go” from the Dining facility.
No more than 50 patrons will be permitted to enter the facility at one time.
Patrons are encouraged to maintain a 6-foot social distance radius from the next person waiting in line so as to minimize any unnecessary exposure.
Food handler gloves will be provided upon entrance and all patrons are encouraged to wear them at the self-service stations (deli, salad and dessert bars).
At this time all other Dining Hall and Retail locations are expected to remain closed. These locations are:

Athletics and Recreation
The East and West Recreation Facilities are closed, effective March 15. A date to reopen the facilities has not yet been determined.

The outdoor fields, jogging path, hiking trails, west tennis and basketball courts and fitness multi-station remain available.

The health and safety of our campus community continues to be our highest priority, and we are making several changes, detailed below, based on the governor’s announcements and the guidance of health officials.

To date, there are no confirmed cases on campus. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience as we work to reduce the opportunities for COVID-19 to spread on our campus and regional community. Thank you again for all you are doing to help protect our campus and community.

Please be advised that effective Wednesday, March 18, 2020 through Tuesday, April 7, 2020, permit requirements for regular, non-reserved parking spaces on the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park will be temporarily suspended.  
We anticipate that this measure can not only help maximize social distancing on campus by allowing users to bypass the sales office or transit, but also ease any impacts and inconveniences that recent COVID-19 related responses might be having on people’s commutes or routines.  
PLEASE NOTE, this does not apply to ADA Spaces, reserved spaces of any kind, ParkMobile or pay station spaces, fire lanes, or vehicles parked out of marked spaces.  Noncompliance may result in citation. Thank you for your consideration, and for your patience during this unprecedented event.

Until we are able to reopen for normal operations, all business must be conducted remotely and by US Mail. While we will endeavour to process all requests as expediently as possible, delays may occur.  Thank you in advance for your patience. 
For updates and more information about refunds, renewals, or other permit-related business, please see our FAQ page.
Campus Transit
We will make every attempt to operate Campus Transit as scheduled, including bike shuttles. This situation is fluid and dynamic, however, and may necessitate adjustments to routes and service.  If and when this should occur, we will endeavour to alert the campus community as soon as possible. Additionally, as a result of state, local and national COVID-19 prevention guidance, METRO customers can expect service disruptions and route cancellations until further notice. Please monitor email and text alerts and the METRO website daily for updates - www.scmetro.com.

March 17, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
As you know, we are in the midst of a dangerous global pandemic and the County of Santa Cruz has issued a Shelter in Place Order for all residents. For the safety of our campus community, we are now in the process of winding down all but essential on-campus operations. Late last week we sent out an email to all researchers about our Research Continuity with COVID-19 webpage, in which we recommended that faculty and researchers take certain steps to prepare for a possible campus shutdown. We are writing now to require that all labs follow that guidance and, as spelled out further below, obtain approval for any research projects and key research personnel you believe must remain active on campus during this time. Until further notice, all projects and personnel not approved are required to wind down on-campus research operations by the end of the week. For the purposes of this communication, on-campus refers to all research operations at UCSC locations within a jurisdiction with a Shelter in Place Order.

Even where research is deemed essential, we need to reduce the density of people working in UCSC research spaces. All principal investigators must communicate with trainees and other lab members about preparation for the shutdown of all non-critical research activities.

We understand that the long-term viability of many research programs during this period will require management of essential animal lines, equipment, liquid nitrogen stocks, and certain long-term experiments. To meet these needs, each laboratory (or neighboring group of laboratories) must identify 1-2 key personnel who will be responsible for any essential ongoing maintenance.

When determining the appropriate size of your lab’s “skeleton crew,” please also consider any equipment that might require gas or cryogen monitoring/service, such as deep-storage freezers, electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, and incubators. Keep in mind that any potentially hazardous operation will require at least two trained and qualified persons be present. We are providing a “Lab Ramp-Down Checklist” that was assembled by EH&S and the Office of Research. It should be noted that in a campus curtailment, there will be limited EH&S support and their response capabilities may be diminished.

Our mouse facilities have been in direct communication with laboratories and have procedures in place to deal with curtailed operations. Individual labs using aquatic or avian species are expected to maintain basic animal care and husbandry operations, and labs with USDA-covered animals that require specialized lab care or intensive husbandry operations are expected to continue providing this care. 

For all key personnel, it has been mandated that everyone practice good hygiene and social distancing, in part by coordinating with others to minimize time on campus and to avoid being in the lab or animal facilities at the same time as others.

To continue their research at home, laboratory members should be encouraged to work on writing projects, literature review, data analysis, or online learning (coding, statistics, etc.). Be sure that lab members are well equipped to work remotely.

If there are essential personnel necessary for the continuation of ongoing critical experiments, instrument maintenance or animal care, you will be required to request permission using this Essential Research Exception Request form. The form will be routed to your Department Chair, Dean, and VCR for approval. Only those meeting the criteria below will be approved.

Criteria for essential personnel

1) Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals and other not easily replaceable perishable research materials.

 Examples:
- Vivarium staff
- Non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care
- Greenhouse staff
- Faculty/research staff necessary to maintain other not easily replaceable perishable research materials. This could be primary cell lines or long-term experiments that there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end. (For example, if there has been a continual one-month experiment that has been on-going that requires regular measurements or maintenance to maintain otherwise all previous data is lost).

2) Responsible for maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage or high cost to equipment.

Examples:
- Cryogen fill on the NMR spectrometer

3) Conducting experiments that have a small time window for completion.

Examples: 
- Time-sensitive experiments with not easily replaceable perishable research materials
- Experiments with a specific measurement that can only take place a few times a year

4) Conducting critical COVID-19 research.

5) Necessary for other critical research/lab-related functions not covered under the above definitions whose presence can prevent danger or significant damage to facilities or research activities.

We completely understand that these restrictions are difficult for you and your laboratory personnel. Our focus at this time is on maintaining safety while avoiding catastrophic damage to people’s research and careers. We hope you appreciate the full magnitude of this crisis and understand that these short-term setbacks will lead to a better outcome for our entire community.

Dear Resident,

Action Required by Friday, March 20. Please read below for instructions.

The emergence of COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for communities all across the country. As COVID-19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations.

In order to dramatically reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge students who can safely leave to do so by Sunday, March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.

ACTION REQUIRED by March 20: Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants
Students departing Housing - Complete the Intent to Vacate form (form requires a UCSC account)
Students remaining in Housing - Complete the Remain in Residence form (form requires a UCSC account)
Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the Late Checkout form.

More detail below:

Students Moving Out of University Housing
Whether you have already left campus or are planning to soon, please complete the Intent to Vacate form (form requires a UCSC account) by Friday, March 20. If you have already completed this form then you do not need to complete it again.

Students who complete their move-out and/or have submitted their Intent to Vacate notice by Friday, March 20 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time.

We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.

Additionally, we will not be voiding guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13-20 Priority Housing Application Period.

Students Remaining in University Housing
If you need to remain in university housing through spring, please indicate that by completing the Remain in Residence form by Friday, March 20.

Students may consider remaining on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
Do not have access to alternate housing
Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence
Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation
Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning
Other extenuating circumstances
As a university, we understand the challenges faced in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distancing on our campus.

It is likely we will need to close some of the residential buildings and relocate those students remaining on campus into fewer locations, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.

Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we work to keep students and the UCSC community healthy and safe.

Guidance for Employees and Supervisors Regarding the Use of Paid Administrative Leave Pursuant to President Napolitano’s Executive Order Dated March 16, 2020
The University of California has modified the emergency temporary leave policies issued on March 9th in accordance with an Executive Order issued by President Napolitano on March 16th granting paid administrative leave to university employees who are impacted by the COVID-19 emergency. This message provides guidance about how we will implement the Executive Order (EO) for academic, staff and student employees at UC Santa Cruz.

This remains a very fluid situation, and the guidance below may be updated as new information becomes available. Managers and supervisors are encouraged to provide as much flexibility as possible to employees needing to take leave.

All Employees
Effective immediately, all employees (including staff, academic and student employees) will be eligible to receive up to 128 hours paid administrative leave in order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Paid Administrative Leave may only be used for the following purposes:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID-19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the dependent care commitment.
The allocation for employees with less than full time appointments shall be prorated based on appointment percentage
The 128 hours may be used consecutively in one block or incrementally
In making the determination as to whether to grant the leave, supervisors must take into account the operational needs of the University with special consideration given to the critical importance of maintaining the continuity of medical center operations
Employees may still use accrued sick, vacation or paid time off in order to address their own illness or the serious medical condition of a family member.
The Paid Administrative Leave may be used prior to usage of other accrued leave.
Paid Administrative Leave can be used retroactively to March 1, 2020.
Subject to the University’s ongoing operational needs, the paid administrative leave provided pursuant to the Executive Order must be used no later than December 31, 2020.
Paid Administrative Leave is available for any new employees hired during the duration of President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.
An employee who separates from the employment of the University before December 31, 2020 will lose eligibility for Paid Administrative Leave; there is no “cash-in” value connected to the leave.
Employees who are essential to on-campus operations may be required to come to work to ensure educational and business continuity. Managers and employees are encouraged to work together to formulate plans for shift coverage in these essential operational areas to ensure social distancing practices are being followed.

Staff Employees

All individual staff employees are eligible for administrative leave with pay. However, individuals who do not meet one of the three criteria described in the EO for using administrative leave with pay will need to cover unplanned absences with accruals. Additionally, supervisors are required to approve the administrative leave with pay, and such approval will be based on operational necessity to continue essential services.

At this time, formal telecommuting agreements are not being used for COVID-19 related remote work. Supervisors and managers should exercise discretion in determining whether individuals may take home university property to complete work from home. If university property, such as laptops, keyboards, or other items, are brought home by employees, supervisors are encouraged to log equipment serial numbers to track which items are being used in employee homes.  

Individual staff members who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on their timesheet on that day.   

Supervisors and managers will need to work with their employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the four criteria. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual time records. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.

Part time employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee’s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule. 

Employees who are currently on an approved leave of absence (not related to COVID-19) should continue to record your sick leave and/or vacation leave as discussed in your leave consultation.  If your circumstances have changed, due to COVID-19, please work directly with your Leave Coordinator.

Hourly Student Employees

Student employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee’s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule. 

Individual student employees who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Student employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on the timesheet.   

Supervisors and managers will need to work with their student employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the COVID related reasons. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual timesheets. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.

Academic Employees

Paid Administrative Leave is available for all academic appointees, policy-covered and represented, for the COVID-19-related reasons described in President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.

Use of Paid Administrative Leave must not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services. The delivery of instruction is an essential university service. Faculty who are unable to continue delivering instruction should immediately notify their department chair.

Employees who report time or absences in CruzPay should record Paid Administrative Leave on their timesheets. Employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on the timesheet on that day. When approving timesheets, supervisors are affirming that Paid Administrative Leave is being used in accordance with the Executive Order.
For exempt academic employees, Paid Administrative Leave only needs to be reported for full-day absences; a day is defined as the regular time that an appointee would have worked on that day. For such exempt employees, there will be up to 16 days on which the Paid Administrative Leave would occur.
For non-exempt hourly employees, Paid Administrative Leave should be reported on the timesheet in hourly increments. Non-exempt employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on the appointment percentage.
For faculty and academic student employees who do not complete timesheets (TAs, GSIs, and GSRs), Paid Administrative Leave of 16 days or less should be arranged with the chair/ supervisor. Employees must notify their department chair or faculty supervisor and divisional academic personnel coordinator if they anticipate an absence of more than 16 days, whether consecutive or intermittent. Divisional academic personnel staff will advise employees and supervisors about all available paid leave options on a case by case basis. Divisional staff may consult with the Academic Personnel Office as needed.

Paid medical leave policies in the Academic Personnel Manual (APM 710) and respective collective bargaining agreements (Academic Researchers, Postdocs, Academic Student Employees, Non-Senate Instructional Unit, and Librarians) that are currently available for an appointee’s own illness will extend to cover all COVID-19 qualifying situations, including to care for a family member’s COVID-19 illness, and/or when working remotely is not operationally feasible and the appointee is directed or is under a public order to not to come to work. These extensions of academic policy are in place for the duration of President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.

Paid Administrative Leave is not available for academic appointees in courtesy or without-salary appointments.

Deans retain the authority to provide leave with pay to academic employees for other good cause as delegated in CAPM 900.700.

For academic employees who are currently on leave, have by-agreement appointments, or for other questions, please consult with your Divisional Academic Personnel Office.",1523,cal,3

Our community has pulled together in positive ways in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The current Santa Cruz County and Santa Clara County shelter-in-place orders, plus last night’s statewide stay-at-home order, mandate that we be more explicit in how we respond to this growing public health challenge. 
Further, we understand there may be some confusion or lack of clarity regarding what members of the campus community can do in their work capacity and when they should and should not come to campus locations to work. This memo supersedes all earlier communications, except the Research and Instructional staff directive issued earlier today to instructors, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students.
The information below reflects directives from the university; they are not guidelines. All employees and students must adhere to these directives. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Earlier today we sent a communication specifically addressing the workplace concerns of research and instructional staff and graduate students. 
Dos
Do come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation of the university. Principal officers have been asked to work with managers to identify essential positions that may require work on the residential campus or other campus locations. If you believe that the operation you are supporting is not essential but there is an expectation that you come to work anyway, you may seek confirmation of the essential nature of your work by emailing your principal officer.  


Do come to the residential campus or other campus locations if your supervisor directs you to do so for a specific or limited purpose, even if you are generally working from home. You are allowed to come to campus locations for this purpose.


Do feel free to park in any designated campus parking lot if you are directed to come to work at campus locations. Daytime parking lot enforcement has been suspended at the residential campus, the West Side Research Park, and the Coastal Science Campus so that employees may park closer to needed facilities, reduce the distance they have to walk, and avoid taking public transportation if they choose to do so. 


Do feel free to visit the campus COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address loneliness and isolation that may occur while we are under the shelter-in-place order.


 Don'ts
Do not come to work if you are sick. 


Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave. 


Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down or continuity work as approved and directed by the Vice Chancellor for Research.  Separate, specific guidance has been issued to campus researchers.


Do not come to work at campus locations solely because your home internet access is inadequate, or because the conditions at your home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Staff and faculty who need these resources should address their needs with their supervisor or department chair. There is also a list of helpful resources on the COVID-19 Information Technology Services website.


Do not come to the residential campus or other campus locations because there is something in your office that you would like to retrieve, or because you want to visit with colleagues who must work on campus. You should only be coming to a campus location if your supervisor has given you express permission to do so. Your supervisor can give you permission to come to campus on a one-time basis or as otherwise necessary.  


Building access
The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites, including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes. 
We know that these are challenging times and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through these issues. These directives are designed to further protect our campus community and give you confidence that your work is consistent with the shelter-in-place orders and the statewide stay-at-home order. These directives are intended to safeguard the maintenance of the essential and critical operations of the campus. Please take care of yourselves and be well.",900,cal,3

We are all working hard to adapt to the greater Bay Area and statewide shelter-in-place directives issued this week. UC Santa Cruz employees are permitted by these orders to continue to come to work to carry out the university's essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work at all campus locations to perform duties related to remote instruction and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and essential research continuity. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.
Please read through the detailed information below. These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.
Coverage of this directive
This message is a formal employment directive issued by the interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, and the Vice Chancellor for Research, and it applies to all employees and faculty including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers who are engaged in instruction and research. This directive applies to research and instructional faculty, staff and students; it does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is otherwise determined to be essential. 
Remote instruction 
Faculty, graduate students (in their capacity as TAs and GSIs), and staff may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. We have suspended our Webcast service and it will not be available during the spring quarter. Classrooms will not be available for the preparation or execution of remote instruction. Instructors, teaching assistants, and the staff who support them in remote instruction may use private offices to access the internet for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. Access to, and the use of, private offices must conform to standards of social distancing. 
In cases where remote instruction is possible only with the use of campus facilities, approval must be obtained from department chairs and the relevant dean. Please note that exemptions for use of specialized facilities will be limited to a small number of previously determined lab and studio courses. With the exception of private offices, all uses of campus facilities for the facilitation of remote instruction must be approved in advance and must incorporate mandated standards of social distancing. For approval, please contact your department chair, college provost or program director, who will facilitate approval with the dean. 
As you make the change to fully remote instruction, first visit our Keep Teaching website to take advantage of the teaching resources, technical information and guidance, and virtual consultation services. Resources and consultation are available to support you as you transition to a fully remote environment. Group and individual consultation services can be scheduled by contacting citl@ucsc.edu or help@ucsc.edu. 
Research 
Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may only engage in essential on-campus research continuity activities with the specific approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research. See the March 17 message for further details. PIs will be notified about approvals on a rolling basis. 
No one supporting the campus research enterprise may come to campus for any purpose without approval, nor may approved researchers support or engage in activities that have not been explicitly approved by the VCR. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, contact your department chair, Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research (vcr@ucsc.edu), or Quentin Williams, acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies (qwilliam@ucsc.edu). 
Classroom access
Classrooms will be locked and remain locked through the spring quarter. Some buildings will be locked with access limited to key-card holders. Building managers will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.
The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes. 
When working from home has limitations
Other than the exceptions listed above, no employee, graduate student or instructor supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their campus office to work. Beyond those work environment needs dictated by a responsibility to provide remote instruction, inadequate home internet or home conditions that are not conducive to efficient work are not allowed reasons to come to campus. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Instructors and staff who need equipment to work from home should request support from their supervisor or department chair. 
A word of thanks
We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already enormously stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and the considerable work of all members of our community that we know is going into making these transitions. These changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university. 
In these difficult times, as a public university all UC campuses are prioritizing our shared teaching mission. In putting the academic interests of our students first, we acknowledge the tradeoffs, and to the fullest extent possible we will address the consequences of making these decisions. 
Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times. Be well.",1014,cal,3

Dear Housing Group,
You are receiving this message because we have still not heard from you regarding your residency intentions for spring. As stated in our previous messages on March 13 and March 17, all residential students must complete one of the two forms below. As COVID–19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations. In order to dramatically and immediately reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge all students who can leave campus to do so by Sunday, March 29. Travel to return to your permanent residence is encouraged and permissible.
While students may remain in residence this spring if they fall into one of the categories outlined below, there are operational impacts that will be experienced given COVID–19.
If you intend to leave campus, complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing.
Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the Late Checkout form.
If you do not have an alternate safe housing option and must remain in university housing, complete the Remain in Residence form. See the below list of qualifying reasons to remain in housing.
We are committed to supporting all of our students through this outbreak, especially those who must remain in housing. We want you to know the latest information, so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices.
We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID–19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, testing would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.
The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing andextra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people living in and supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID–19.
It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID–19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the infection to spread.
We will need to close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.
Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.
Students Moving Out of University Housing
As stated in our original communication, if you complete your move-out by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time. Further, more recently we asked that students who can safely leave by Sunday, March 29, please do so. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.
We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which the move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.
Additionally, we will not be voiding housing guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a housing guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13–20 Priority Housing Application Period.
Students Planning to Remain in University Housing
Students may remain in university housing during spring only if one or more of the following conditions apply:
Do not have access to alternate housing
Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence
Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation
Permanent residence is in an area highly impacted by COVID–19
Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning
Other extenuating circumstances
Thank you for your patience and flexibility.

Dear students,

We write today to acknowledge the challenges you have faced over the past two weeks as we switched to remote learning and final exams, and to express our sincere gratitude for taking the changes head on. These are not easy days, and you have demonstrated resilience and patience. Thank you.

As we face the enormous challenge of a global pandemic, we know that shifting to remote instruction will not be simple or seamless. But in accepting this change, you are helping us to reduce the density of people learning, living, and working on campus. That will ultimately help reduce the spread and intensity of COVID-19. The sacrifices you and all members of our campus community are making are crucial to efforts to quell this health crisis, and we are deeply grateful for your efforts in these unprecedented times.

Continuing to educate in the face of such uncertainty is not an attempt on our part to maintain normalcy. It highlights our commitment to you — our students — and to our community. Many of you depend on financial aid, and by helping you stay the course, we hope to keep you on track for graduation.

Crisis reveals the vulnerabilities of our systems and our ways of life. We are working to ensure our campus remains open to house those of you who need it, and to do so as safely as possible. We are only just beginning to understand the scale of this public health challenge and the changes needed to support our community. With that in mind, we also thank you for your engagement as these issues unfold.

This has not been an easy year for UC Santa Cruz. It has been and continues to be a privilege to face these difficulties and uncertainties alongside you. UCSC and our community will emerge from these challenges a stronger, more resilient campus.",343,cal,3

Dear colleagues,

We write today to express our sincere gratitude for all that you have done and will do in the coming months to continue to support our students, our faculty, our research, and the mission of UC Santa Cruz.

As we face the enormous challenge of a global pandemic, we know that shifting to remote instruction will not be simple or seamless. But your efforts to help students continue to learn remotely, to support faculty and researchers, and to keep the university up and running have allowed us to reduce the density of people living and working on campus. That will ultimately help reduce the spread and intensity of COVID-19. The work you are doing is crucial, and we are deeply grateful for your efforts in these unprecedented times.

Dear colleagues,

We write today to express our sincere gratitude for all that you have done and will do in the coming months to continue to provide instruction to our students. As we face the enormous challenge of a global pandemic, we know that shifting to remote instruction will not be simple, seamless or the solution to every problem. But your efforts to help students continue to learn remotely have allowed us to reduce the density of people living and working on campus. That will ultimately help reduce the spread and intensity of COVID-19. The work you are doing is crucial, and we are deeply grateful for your efforts in these unprecedented times.

Continuing instruction is not an attempt to maintain normalcy. It highlights our collective commitment to our students and our community. Many of our students depend on financial aid, and by continuing to teach, you are allowing our students to access crucial resources and to stay on track for graduation. While we are apart, you are continuing to create communities of learning.

Santa Cruz,22-Mar-2020,"The Financial Aid Office shared an update with students about potential financial aid adjustments.

March 22 - Financial Aid and Spring Housing Adjustments Email
 
Dear Student,
We appreciate your patience as we work as quickly and carefully as possible during this unprecedented challenge to provide you with information and resources in support of your educational goals.
As communicated in messages from Campus Housing, students who have completed the process to fully vacate their on-campus residence by required deadlines will receive a credit for housing and dining fees assessed or paid for spring quarter. These adjustments to your housing and dining charges may result in increased financial aid refunds for financial aid recipients (see the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office message of March 18 and the linked COVID-19 website).
The processing of housing and dining credits will be on-going throughout the next few weeks. Staff in Financial Aid are working in parallel, adjusting aid as quickly as possible, with some student financial aid refunds delayed as work proceeds. In spite of these efforts, it is anticipated there will be some students who will see multiple financial aid refunds or receive additional billing due to the processing timeline. As compared to the normal spring budget for students commuting from home or living with parents, the new remote student budget includes an additional $2,000. The additional budget items are intended to address expenses such as housing, food, technology setup for remote instruction, medical and other costs you may incur during the spring term.
Students may receive financial aid refunds, through direct deposit or checks from Student Business Services, when the total accepted aid is greater than expenses billed by the campus (such as for tuition and fees, on-campus housing and dining, and USHIP). For on-campus students, such financial aid refunds may be modest or may not exist. Changing to the new remote student budget may change your financial aid refund.
For students who normally receive financial aid refunds, the amounts will vary depending upon accepted aid and remaining charges on the student account. An example of the possible change in refunded amounts for a $0 Expected Family Contribution (EFC) California (CA) Resident student is below:
$0 EFC CA Resident, On-Campus Triple Room 5-day meal plan with USHIP
Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $10,332
Total Spring Aid : $10,332 (includes $1,167 loan)
Estimated Spring Refund $ 0
 
$0 EFC CA Resident, Remote Instruction with USHIP
Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $5,670
Total Spring Aid : $9,145 (includes $1,167 loan)
Estimated Spring Refund $ 3,475
Spring disbursement of financial aid is scheduled for March 23, with direct deposit refunds on March 25 and paper check processing occurring on March 31. While our offices are working as quickly as possible to resolve financial aid and housing adjustments, there may continue to be activity on your account in the following weeks.
Thank you again for your patience,
Financial Aid and Scholarships Office

Santa Cruz,27-Mar-2020,"Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced that a student living off campus tested positive for COVID-19
Emergency notification: Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSC
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham
March 27, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
We write to share that the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency confirmed today that a student member of the UC Santa Cruz community has tested positive for COVID-19. The student lives off campus and has been self-isolating since being tested. The student was last on campus March 16 and is doing well. 
We are coordinating closely with local public health officials and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance in responding to this case. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who may have had significant exposure to this individual and who may subsequently have an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Public health officials will determine specific actions that may be needed, such as self-quarantine. 
The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. The campus is ensuring that this student is getting the care and support that they need. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel continue to proactively identify individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure and request that they self-quarantine to protect our community. 
Students, faculty, and staff should stay home and call their health care provider if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, especially fever and cough. The CDC’s coronavirus self-checker is a good tool to help you determine what next steps should be taken.
What students should do
Students, whether on campus, off campus in Santa Cruz, or at their permanent residence, can call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make a telehealth or in-person appointment. Information about after-hours care for students is available online. Acutely ill students who are not in Santa Cruz should seek medical care from a healthcare provider in their area.
If you are a student who received care off-campus and have tested positive, or if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, please notify the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 so that we can help coordinate your care and support the health of our campus community.
What employees should do
Employees should seek medical care through their regular health care providers. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at oes@ucsc.edu.
Where you can find updates and additional information
The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.
We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this challenging time. 
Steps to stay healthy 
The CDC provides the following guidance on how to protect yourself: 
Clean your hands often:
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. 
Avoid close contact with others:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Put distance between yourself and other people (at least 6 feet).
Take steps to protect others:
Stay home, except for essential business/services as covered in the state’s stay-at-home order.
Cover coughs and sneezes:
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
Throw used tissues in the trash.
Immediately clean your hands.
Wear a facemask if you are sick and around other people.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. ",712,cal,3

Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation
To: Campus Housing Residents
From: UCSC Student Housing Services
March 29, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus. Students who can return to a permanent address or make alternate housing arrangements have been encouraged to leave campus. However, we understand that leaving campus may not be an option for everyone and we are committed to supporting our students through this outbreak.
In order to focus our staffing and support services on the needs of a smaller residential population on campus, we will be relocating the following residents:
Students living in residence halls
Students living at the Camper Park, Village, or University Town Center
Students living in apartments at Cowell College, Redwood Grove, and the Porter Apartment Buildings F and G
Students will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College, or Merrill College. It is our goal to:
Reassign apartment residents to the apartments at one of the above communities.
Reassign residence hall residents to the residence hall facilities at one of the above communities. These housing areas are in proximity to one of the two campus dining halls that we currently plan to keep open (College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown Dining Hall).
Moving assistance will be provided. This will include moving bins, supplies such as cardboard boxes and tape, as well as movers and trucks to transport your belongings to your new housing assignment.
Housing staff are currently working on your new housing assignment. You will soon receive a message with information about your new room assignment and instructions for completing your move. To be clear, this move is mandatory and we appreciate your cooperation. Note: special attention is being placed on students with disability-related needs to ensure the new housing assignment will meet their individual needs.
In order to maximize efficient use of housing space, while also implementing appropriate physical distancing for residents, each room will be assigned as a single. Students will not be negatively financially impacted by this change to single occupancy residency. Instead all residential students will be charged the triple room rate for spring quarter. Additionally, students on the 5-day meal plan for spring quarter will be upgraded, at no additional cost, to the 7-day plan to ensure dining access during the weekends. Students already on the 7-day plan for spring quarter will receive a rate reduction to the cost of the 5-day plan. Apartment residents who wish to obtain the 7-day meal plan at the 5-day plan cost may do so.
You are receiving this letter because you have indicated that you plan to remain in residence this spring. We want you to know the latest information so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. If you can make alternate housing arrangements, we strongly urge you to do so. If you do plan to leave campus, please complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing as soon as possible. We will continue to offer a full housing refund for spring quarter to students who give their intent to vacate and complete their move-out by April 19.
Based upon the current public health information available, the following details the conditions we anticipate in our residential buildings during spring quarter. Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation and circumstances may change further.
We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, it would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.
The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with physical distancing recommendations, cessation of group gatherings, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people residing in as well as staff supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID-19.
It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the virus to spread.
We will close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve physical distancing.
Any resident who remains on campus for spring should be prepared to be relocated (possibly more than once) so that we may create spaces for isolation as well as quarantine.
Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.
We appreciate that this information may add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you.
Since you are planning to remain in residence during spring, please begin to prepare yourself for relocation, and follow instructions that will follow from your Housing/Student Life Office.
Sincerely,
Student Housing Services",911,cal,3

Dear Staff and Faculty Colleagues,
COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for us. Among those many challenges is the question of whether and how we can continue to employ students. I’m writing with thoughts related to this question.
For many students, whether they are eligible for work-study or not, a campus-paid job is part of their financial aid plan. The prospect of losing income now because of COVID-19 could create hardship, possibly even endangering their ability to continue as students. I have already heard from students who are deeply concerned over the possible loss of income, and who starting spring quarter may be unable to pay for rent and buy groceries. Obviously, challenges like this disproportionately affect our students who are historically underserved, a barrier to our goal of equity of outcomes.
In addition to sustaining a student financially, employment is also a key part of the student experience, engaging them and contributing to student professional development. Now more than ever, continuing to provide engagement and developmental experiences would be helpful to our students.
For all of these reasons, for those of you who have been employing students, I encourage you to continue doing so to the fullest extent possible during this period of COVID-19.
There are many ways of employing students even remotely. Students can complete special assignments, projects, or job-related reading or training. Now could be a great time to catch up on projects and tasks that we often delay because of our busy work days. I encourage you to be creative in offering work to our students to help mitigate the impact of losing income. Our FAQ page on student employment (see below) offers more ideas. (Please note, however: students should not be assigned work or hired into positions that would otherwise be completed by career employees if career employees need additional hours to fulfill their appointment percentages.)
We recognize that you may have many questions about hiring students given our new realities. For example, can Work Study students be employed remotely? Answer: Yes! To help you get answers, we have created this FAQ page. We will continue to improve it, and we welcome your feedback on it.
Thanks for everything you’re doing to support our students.

The UC Santa Cruz community continues to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are being proactive in maximizing physical distancing, while maintaining the critical operations needed to support students and employees who continue to live on campus, to facilitate remote learning, and to ensure the campus infrastructure is maintained and campus facilities are safe. The COVID-19 situation continues to be dynamic. Not only does it impact campus operations, but it has impacted the personal lives of everyone in the campus community and across the globe. Thank you for your cooperation and patience as we navigate the situation and collectively work to mitigate the spread of the virus.
Over the last few weeks, we have outlined the steps we are taking during this public health crisis in several campus messages. Our actions have adapted over time as we learn more and as we comply with federal, state and local mandates, as well as guidance coming from the UC Office of the President. Yesterday, the Santa Cruz County Health Department issued a new order extending the current shelter in place mandate until May 3 and outlining additional clarifications on allowable activities. They also issued a useful FAQ that addresses questions members of the Santa Cruz community have. 
Our campus continues to be defined in the directive as an essential institution and activities we undertake for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential functions are allowable, provided that physical distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.
Below is an update on the latest information on campus operations. Please note that some restrictions that had been put in place until April 7 will now continue through at least May 3 to comply with new county orders. For additional information, you can access the UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 website.
Dining Services
Dining Services will be operating the College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown/Merrill Dining Hall during the spring quarter as a take-out only service.  Additional information is available at the Dining COVID-19 Response page.
Campus Housing
Students living in campus housing have been asked to return to their permanent residences if conditions allow. The housing office is relocating students who remain on campus in an effort to maximize physical distancing, while also ensuring staff can adequately support those who remain. Additional information can be found at the Housing COVID-19 page.
Campus Events
Guidance was given in earlier communications that campus events and events hosted in/on campus facilities should be canceled or postponed through the remainder of the spring quarter. No new events should be scheduled for the spring quarter. Event sponsors can contact the Office of the Campus Counsel to discuss considerations for event contracts. Information on commencement and guidance on summer event planning will be forthcoming.
Campus Travel
All campus travel scheduled to take place prior to May 3 that does not comply with current shelter-in-place directives should be canceled or postponed. All non-essential business should be canceled or postponed for the rest of the spring quarter. Principal officers will provide guidance on any needed exceptions, though they must comply with other local and federal travel guidelines.
Employees and Leave Options
Earlier this month, directives for employees and for research and instructional staff were shared to clarify expectations for working at and physically accessing campus locations. Principal officers have oversight of their divisions in determining the minimum staff members needed to maintain critical on-campus operations. The new COVID-19 administrative pay program launched earlier this month is still in effect and those leave hours can be used prior to December 31, 2020 to support employees unable to work due to COVID-19 related reasons. Staff Human Resources has developed an FAQ site to answer many questions related to staff employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic employees may refer to the Academic Personnel Office’s COVID-19 information site. 
Research Activities
The Office of Research has been coordinating research continuity planning across divisions. Additional information is available online. Principal officers can provide division-specific guidance on how research should be handled during the shelter in place.
Remote Instruction
The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning is offering resources and essential information for instructors at the Keep Teaching site.  
Library
Both the McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library will be closed until further notice. Services that involve accessing or exchanging physical items will not be offered. All patron-facing services will focus solely on online or remote options. More information about resources and contacts are available at the Library Remote Access webpage.  
Bookstore
The bookstore remains closed to walk-in shopping. Online orders for all products can be placed for pickup at the will call window or may be shipped, free of charge. The Express Store will remain open but will follow stringent social distancing guidelines and limit the number of individuals allowed inside at any time. More information can be found at the Bay Tree Bookstore site.
Outdoor Recreation
As outlined in the Santa Cruz Health Department order, outdoor recreation activities, including walking, hiking, bicycling, and running, must be in compliance with physical distancing, which is six feet of distance from other individuals.",939,cal,4

Anyone who is still in residence after this date, or whose belongings remain in residence, will be charged for the period of time from the start of the quarter to the date their move-out is completed.
If you cannot retrieve your belongings by April 19, Dormbox is available to pack and ship/store your belongings before this deadline. Dormbox is scheduled to be at UCSC this Saturday 4/4 as well as Saturday 4/18 to assist students—students can be present, or not.
Signing up with Dormbox is easy:
1. Register with Dormbox. Provide your name, email, and phone number.
2. Provide Dormbox with information about where you’re living at UCSC.
3. Select a date and time preference for Dormbox to pack your belongings.

The focused effort and flexibility our community has displayed in the transition to remote teaching, learning, and research for the final weeks of winter quarter, and now spring quarter, has been remarkable. Your instructors and the many staff members who support students and research at UC Santa Cruz have worked incredibly hard to ensure we can continue to carry out our mission. Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we extend the physical boundaries of our academic community during our efforts to keep each other safe. 
We recognize that you have many questions and concerns as you head into the spring quarter, and we hope to address many of them below.
Tuition and mandatory fees
Consistent with guidance from the UC Office of the President, all tuition and campus-based fees (excluding housing and dining) will remain unchanged for students enrolled during spring quarter. While the modality of instruction and assessment has changed in many cases, we know that UC instructors and staff will continue to provide high-quality instruction, advising and support services to students while we remain apart. Students will continue to receive full credit for their courses just as they would were we not in a fully remote instructional environment. The emergency transition to remote learning has been costly as we support students, staff, and faculty to work and learn from afar while we continue to maintain significant campus operations. 
We also have had multiple inquiries about campus-based, mandatory fees. We understand that this announcement will be disappointing to many, but these fees are almost entirely determined by student referenda, and are not a direct charge for the use of on-campus facilities or services. Many of these fees support the salaries of student-facing staff who will continue to provide non-instructional services to students remotely. Campus fees also provide for the upkeep of crucial facilities that will still require maintenance throughout the coming months. Perhaps most importantly, these fees also support student financial aid and student initiatives that will continue remotely. These fees will not be redirected to any other purpose and will continue to be used to improve the student experience at UC Santa Cruz. 
Course fees are currently being examined on a course by course basis to determine which are still appropriate and which should be refunded. This work is ongoing and if you have questions about course fees, please contact the office offering the course. Miscellaneous fees are fees for services, and are only charged when the service is used. Units will make refund decisions for payments already received based on whether the service was available and utilized.
On-campus housing and other services
Over the past two weeks, the majority of students living on campus have returned to their permanent residences. Refunds of housing and dining charges for these groups are ongoing and may not be immediately reflected on your portal. 
Those who remain in on-campus housing are encouraged to continue maintaining physical distance from other residents and to follow the directions of the housing and dining staff. To better serve students and ensure that we can support our region through this public health crisis, housing staff is working to ensure each student has their own room in a staffed building. Please continue to check your UCSC email to receive timely updates on any changes to housing plans. 
Financial aid
The Financial Aid and Scholarship Office will continue to support students remotely via email this quarter. Because of the high-volume of changes and questions, please recognize that financial aid may not immediately reflect changes you have made to your enrollment, housing, or dining plans.
Student services
Most student services will continue to operate throughout the spring quarter. This includes the Student Health Center, which is currently providing phone appointments; Counseling and Psychological Services; the Office of Equity and Equal Protection, which supports students experiencing discrimination or harrassment, and the Dean of Students office, which can provide comprehensive case management for graduate and undergraduate students. 
Please continue to monitor your email as federal, state and county guidelines continue to change rapidly. We wish you the best of luck this quarter and encourage everyone to treat themselves and one another with patience during this difficult time.",732,cal,4

We are deeply saddened and disappointed to hear about multiple instances of racist and offensive disruptions to class sessions held via Zoom. This behavior causes real harm and is not tolerated on our campus. Proliferating hate speech in online instructional spaces is not a prank or a joke and our campus is taking these actions very seriously. We ask you all to take them seriously as well and never share Zoom or other video conferencing links in any public forum.
These incidents, as well as recent racist posts on social media, are an attempt to divide our campus community and undermine our Principles of Community. We must come together—against racism, sexism, xenophobia, and white supremacy—and collectively denounce all forms of hate, bias, and discrimination.
While this behavior is never acceptable, it comes at a time when our community members are already burdened with concerns for loved ones, for our first responders and medical community, and for the many people currently battling COVID-19. Some have used this pandemic as an opportunity to incite xenophobia and hatred, particularly against Asian and Asian American people. Any attempt to blame COVID-19 on any group is discriminatory and unacceptable. We condemn any effort to turn this crisis into a vehicle to spread hate. 
We are sorry that anyone has experienced these discriminatory disruptions, and we thank you for continuing to support our community of learning. As we continue spring quarter remotely, we must do everything we can to keep our digital classroom environments safe and inclusive. Our Keep Teaching website offers instructions on how to create secure Zoom class meetings and prevent uninvited people from joining.

Please open a ticket at help@ucsc.edu with the subject line “ZoomBombing in XXX [your course—ie, LIT 101]. Include information such as Meeting ID, CruzID of host, time of incident, did they use screen sharing, etc.


Students and faculty should refer to https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/ for hate/bias related incidents/comments during zoom classes.

Permit Requirements On Campus
Effective April 8, 2020 through May 3, 2020, permit requirements for regular, non-reserved parking spaces on campus, including the Coastal Sciences Campus and the Westside Research Park facility (2300 Delaware), will continue to be temporarily suspended.
*** This suspension only applies to regularly marked, non-reserved parking spaces in public parking lots. All other campus parking regulations will be enforced.***   
Enforceable violations continue to include, but are not limited to, the following during this time:
Violations related to unauthorized vehicles parked in areas not designated for parking.


Violations related to vehicles parked in individually marked, posted or reserved parking spaces.


Examples: roadways posted as restricted, campus medical spaces, posted carpool spaces, posted university vehicle areas or spaces, individually posted spaces reserved for specific permits or permit types, etc.


Violations related to unauthorized vehicles parked in reserved/restricted areas, or areas that require special access privileges.


Violations related to ADA/Disability parking spaces.


Violations related to vehicles parked outside of, or over marked parking space lines.


Violations related to Loading and Time Zones.


Violations related to vehicles obstructing any roadway, pathway, sidewalk, stairwell, etc.


Violations related to marked curbs (e.g. red, green, yellow, etc.), no parking zones and Fire Lanes.


Violations related to individually marked/posted ParkMobile spaces, pay stall (pay per space) or individual spaces where meters are posted (only during posted enforcement times).


Violations related to the display of an altered or counterfeit permit.


Complaints regarding illegally parked vehicles should continue to be reported directly to the Campus Police Department, Parking Enforcement at (831) 459-2231 x1.
Special Parking requests (including Contractor and Vendor Parking):
Because of possible delays in response times due to current conditions, any special parking requests/reservations will need to be arranged through TAPS in advance at taps@ucsc.edu. 
Contractors and vendors may park in regularly marked, non-reserved parking spaces without permits at this time.  However, those that have a need to be parked outside of regularly designated, non-reserved parking spaces (e.g. - out of space, in reserved spaces, etc) need to obtain reserved parking and associated permits.
For A-Construction or Limited Construction Permits, they should contact tapssales@ucsc.edu.  


For construction-related parking or staging spaces, please use the TAPS Construction Contract. To fill the form, download it to your computer and view in Acrobat Reader. For questions, please email Deborah Bryant with TAPS at DBryant@ucsc.edu.


*Project managers should verify that any current construction parking needs comply to standard campus parking requirements as of the date of this message.
Please note that due to current state and federal mandates, and in order to comply with these orders, special parking requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and only those deemed as essential to the operational needs of the campus will be authorized.

Santa Cruz,6-Apr-2020,"Important information regarding residential relocation
Important information regarding residential relocation
To: Housing Residents
From: UCSC Student Housing Services
April 06, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
Dear Student,
On Sunday, March 29th, you received a notification that you may be required to move from your current campus residence to another space on campus for the remainder of the spring quarter. While the exact date of relocation and details related to your specific assignment have not yet been determined, we want to share more with you about why these moves are necessary. Our highest priority is supporting the health and well-being of our campus community.
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 7,000 students have cancelled their on-campus housing contracts, dramatically reducing our residential population. While we would normally house nearly 9,000 students, the student population on-campus is now approximately 1,200 with an additional 800 people residing in the Family Student Housing complex and in Employee housing.
Students will continue to reside in:
College Nine Residence Halls and Apartments
College Ten Residence Halls and Apartments
Crown Residence Halls and Apartments
Merrill Residence Halls and Apartments
College Apartment communities (with the exception of Porter Bldg F and all Cowell Apartments)
Redwood Grove Apartments
Graduate Housing Apartments
Family Student Housing
Camper Park
Residential areas that will no longer have student residents during Spring 2020:
Porter College Residence Halls and the Transfer Community
Porter College Apartments, Bldg F
Rachel Carson Residence Halls
Oakes College Residence Halls
Cowell College Residence Halls
Cowell College Apartments
Stevenson College Residence Halls
The Village
University Town Center
We fully acknowledge these relocations are stressful and come with a feeling of community loss, and we do not take the decision to make such a requirement lightly. As indicated in your housing agreement, the University maintains the right to assign or reassign you to any university-sponsored residence space that is available. Given the current health crisis, there are many factors contributing to why a relocation is necessary at this time.
Our overarching priority is the safety and well-being of all our students remaining on campus. We plan to relocate students to promote and increase physical distancing, as described by the state and county stay in place orders, while also making sure we have staff available to support the needs of our residential community.
As we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we want to ensure we have space available to help in our response.
Supporting the health of our residential community: We are establishing space on campus where UCSC students and employees may be quarantined or isolated should they become ill. These spaces will be held at the Village, the University Town Center, and Cowell College apartments. Because students in quarantine or isolation have a need for a private residence and private bathroom, we need to have available the ability to utilize all three of these communities for our own campus community needs. We do not wish to have students sharing residential space where another student who is ill may be placed next door to isolate.
Supporting our community:Given the evolving nature of this pandemic and its profound impact on local communities, we are working with the county and other agencies to identify community space needs. The entire UC system is working with their local communities to identify partnerships that support public health needs during this pandemic. We feel this is best for our community, and the broader Santa Cruz community’s needs, to make available completely vacated buildings which is why we cannot continue to have students in residence in these locations.
Additional factors include:
Ensuring quality service:Given the significant reduction in available custodial staffing due to COVID-19, localizing residence hall students within the four designated colleges allows us to more effectively deploy the limited custodial resources currently available.
Providing appropriate staff support:We are better able to effectively staff our housing communities and provide safety and security for our students in consolidated locations.
What are the ways in which we will coordinate this relocation effort?
Students with disability-related accommodations will have their accommodation honored in their new assignment.
Students in Cowell College apartments will have priority to relocate to the Stevenson Apartments. Students in Porter Building F will have priority placement in other Porter Apartments.
Students in college residence halls will have the ability to move to the apartments in their college should they wish to do so. For example, Porter Residence Hall students will be given the opportunity to move to the Porter Apartments. Students who move from the residence halls to the apartments will not have a required meal plan, though they certainly may opt to purchase a meal plan of their choice. If you are currently living in a residence hall and wish to move to the apartments, please contact your Housing Coordinator.
Students who wish to or need to remain in a residence hall facility will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College or Merrill College.
All students will be assigned to private rooms but charged at the triple room rate.
Relocation assistance, including moving vans for distant travel, boxes, tape, labels, etc. will be provided.
Students who submit their Intent to Vacate and complete their move-out (i.e. remove all belongings and return any university keys) by April 19 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Anyone who is still in residence after this date should plan to be reassigned to a new residential location.
As a reminder, the county health directive instructs that public and private gatherings outside of an immediate household are prohibited. An immediate household is not all residents who may reside in a building together, in a community together or even in close proximity. Your immediate household is defined as your private bedroom. We are intentionally assigning students to single occupancy rooms in order to safely practice physical distancing. Guests will not be permitted to visit within a student’s residence.
Because it will take a bit of time for all residences to be vacated and prepared for new occupancy, we are uncertain of the exact date/time of your move. You will receive, in advance of any move, specific instructions related to your relocation.
It is not our intention to add undue burden or stress on any of our students, and hope that you understand why these changes are necessary. Should you be experiencing any distress, support is available for you from CAPS, College Student Life staff, or Slug Support.
Sincerely,
Student Housing Services

Santa Cruz County has announced the temporary closure of all public parks, trails, trailheads and beaches from 11:59 p.m. April 8 to April 15. This new order is a supplement to the county’s existing shelter-in-place order. 
The county’s order specifies that the following facilities and recreation areas are to be closed to the public as of April 8, 2020 and extending through April 15, 2020:
All public trails, paths, parkways, trailheads, and campgrounds.


All public beaches, piers and beach pedestrian or bike paths that traverse the beach.


All public parks and recreation areas, including but not limited to dog parks, skate parks, pump tracks, playgrounds, golf courses, disc golf courses, pickleball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts and other public sports and recreation areas, as well as any picnic or canopy areas within such places used for congregation.


All parking lots and access points to any of the facilities or areas listed above.


UC Santa Cruz is posting signage at its locations to remind the public of this new county order. 
Wearing face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19
New guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health recommends wearing cloth face coverings when leaving home for essential travel (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory “droplets” with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz county and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.
In accordance with the CDC and California Department of Public Health guidance, we strongly encourage the campus community to use face coverings when in public settings, conducting essential work on campus, or entering campus dining facilities or other environments in which it may be difficult to maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people. 
Reusable cloth face coverings can be made from readily available items such as scarves, bandanas, or neck gaiters, as well as fitted masks that can be made at home or obtained online. 
Face covering resources: 
CDC: Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19


Surgeon General Shows How to Make Your Own Face Covering


UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings. Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.
Managers and supervisors should review this information with all essential employees who are physically on site, including those who visit the work site periodically. For employees and tasks that require close contact with others (less than 6 feet), contact EH&S at ehs@ucsc.edu for a workplace assessment and potential risk minimization support, including protective equipment. 
Remember to shelter in place unless leaving home for essential tasks. Use frequent handwashing, maintain at least a 6 foot distance between you and others when engaging in essential activities in public, and wear a face covering to protect each other. Working together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. 
The safety and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty is of the utmost importance, and we will continue to dedicate unified efforts to protect our campus community. If you have any questions, please email the Office of Emergency Services at oes@ucsc.edu.

UC Santa Cruz will continue remote delivery of instruction through Summer Session 2020. Given what we know now, remote instruction is our best choice for the summer ahead. We are confident this transition will go well, especially after the hard work, dedication, and innovation that has been put into winter and spring quarter’s fast changes.  
We will offer more than 300 summer classes, completely remote. We’re adding more summer classes to support unmet spring demand, and the small number of courses that cannot be taught remotely are being removed. Over the next few weeks, Summer Session will make changes to its website. The Schedule of Classes will be finalized by April 24.
Enrollment opens May 1 at 12:00 a.m. in my.ucsc.edu as planned for all summer classes. 
Financial aid will continue to be available to eligible students, and summer grant estimates are available through their online grant calculator.

UCSC transit driver tests positive for COVID-19

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
UC Santa Cruz was notified late Saturday that an employee who works in Transportation and Parking Services as a campus shuttle driver tested positive for COVID-19. Our thoughts are with this employee and their family. We wish them a quick recovery.
Because the campus shuttle program is a public facing activity that provides services for students, faculty, and staff, we believe there is a need to inform our community about this case. The employee drove the loop route on April 1 and 2 and has not been on campus since then. Transit records indicate that approximately 19 people rode the driver’s bus route over the course of the two days; identities of the passengers are unknown.
We believe this case presents a low risk of exposure to our campus community based on the protocols we instituted on March 17, 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19: campus shuttle passengers use only the rear entrance of a bus to enter and exit the bus; passengers are separated by at least six feet from the bus driver; and buses are cleaned several times throughout the day by TAPS staff.
In accordance with guidance provided by the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency, exposed individuals may already have symptoms or may develop symptoms through April 16, 2020. Students who rode the shuttle on April 1 or 2, and have any symptoms or concerns, can call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 to schedule a telephone visit for risk assessment and possible testing for COVID-19. Faculty or staff who rode the shuttle and have symptoms or concerns should contact their healthcare provider and inform them of any possible exposure and/or symptoms to determine appropriate next steps.
The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. Remember to stay home as much as possible, maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from others, and wear a face covering in public. Also, frequent hand washing with soap and water remains an effective tool in minimizing COVID-19 exposure from surfaces. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.
The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community.
We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this challenging time.",448,cal,4

Effective April 16, 2020, the Santa Cruz County Health Officer lifted the supplemental order that previously had closed and prohibited the use of specific recreational spaces. The campus adopted these restrictions and applied them to multiple campus locations. Although the supplemental order has been lifted by the County, the original restrictions listed in the extended County Public Health Order dated March 31, 2020 are still in effect.  
Be advised that the campus is lifting some access and location restrictions while still maintaining closures of some locations. This decision is to address areas where group gatherings may occur or areas where we have had challenges with people practicing effective physical distancing. Additionally, playground and other recreational equipment has been included due to the challenges of ensuring adequate sanitization of equipment. These restrictions will be in place until the campus determines it is appropriate to reopen these locations. We will continue to monitor and reassess these decisions based on community practices. 
Closure signs (in English and Spanish) are being adjusted based on the list of spaces that will remain closed as noted below. Other areas may be closed or opened without further notice.

We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 quarter, and we want to share as much information with you as possible while we observe the progress of the current pandemic.

Similar to universities around the world, we are developing plans and making critical decisions about the coming 2020-21 academic year. We recognize that the situation is dynamic and evolving, and we will provide updated information as decisions are made.

Decisions about remote vs. in-person instruction
Currently, we intend for the fall quarter to start as scheduled. We are monitoring the local and state public health situation to determine when and to what degree we can resume in-person instruction. Some or all instruction for a portion or all of the 2020-21 academic year may be delivered via remote and/or online instruction as conditions dictate. At this point we do not know exactly when these decisions can be made because the public health situation remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall quarter as soon as there is adequate information to do so. The health and safety of our students, staff, and faculty is our top priority.

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction continues to be offered remotely for any part of the 2020-21 academic year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and many charges for student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising. While we acknowledge that our campus, like other UC campuses, has changed aspects of our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover continue as we maintain operations and prepare for the recovery to full operations.

Student housing for fall 2020
Given the uncertainty of the ongoing public health crisis and the related decision about the manner of instruction for fall quarter, we want to provide you as much information as we can to help you make the best decision for you and your family. It is possible we will not be able to honor guaranteed housing for continuing students. More information will be shared as it becomes available.

I thank you for your understanding and patience during these challenging times. We will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the fall quarter and we are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible.

Santa Cruz County updates shelter-in-place order

UC Santa Cruz continues to address the challenges created by COVID-19. I want to thank everyone in our campus community for their patience during this difficult time. Public health continues to be our top priority. The changes to our campus operations have been implemented with a goal of keeping our campus community as safe as possible, while still ensuring our students have access to the knowledge and expertise that comes with a UC Santa Cruz education even though the method of delivery has adapted.
I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty that has become part of our daily life and the impact it has on our students, staff, and faculty. The members of our campus community are having to juggle campus responsibilities, family needs, and a host of other issues. Our campus has counseling resources to help employees and students who are in need. 
Our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be ongoing and adapt based on public health considerations, and guidance from the state, county, and other agencies. 
Updated county shelter-in-place order
Santa Cruz County announced yesterday that it is extending its shelter in place order and that it will remain in effect until further notice. The county also added more essential activities and essential businesses that will be allowed to operate under the order under certain conditions. The revised order takes effect at 11:59 p.m. today (Friday, May 1). I encourage all of you to read the order to see how it impacts your individual situation.
UC Santa Cruz continues to be defined in the order as an essential business, and activities we undertake for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential activities are allowed, provided that people wear face coverings and that physical distancing of six-feet between persons is maintained to the greatest extent possible. There are new protocols outlined in the order regarding physical distancing and we are working to ensure we are in compliance. We are also reviewing the various aspects of the order to determine if there are any additional adjustments needed to our operations. The Office of Emergency Services will continue to provide Social Distancing Protocols as outlined in the order and COVID-19 safety signs for building principals to post at each main entrance. Managers and supervisors shall ensure signage has been posted or disseminated.  
Our operations at the Silicon Valley Campus are governed by orders issued by Santa Clara County.  We will work with leaders at that location to ensure that they are in compliance with the new orders issued by Santa Clara county earlier this week. 
Both the Santa Cruz and Santa Clara orders contain face covering requirements. For the UCSC locations, this includes wearing a face cover when:
interacting in person with any member of the public


working in any space visited by members of the public


working or walking through common areas, e.g. hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities


preparing food for distribution


in close proximity to others


waiting for or riding in public transit


driving public transit, with or without passengers


There are a limited set of situations in which someone does not need to wear a face covering, such as while driving a car alone or working in an office alone, so long the public does not regularly visit the room.
Outdoor spaces
Earlier this month, UC Santa Cruz lifted some access and location restrictions while still maintaining closures of other locations. We have further adjusted our restrictions to now allow access to trails. It is critical that we prevent the spread of COVID-19, so the campus has decided that the following locations will remain with restricted or closed access.
Coastal Science Campus (limited access to campus, coastal trail accessible)


Westside Research Park (2300 Delaware Ave.)


Workout area near Police Department (Lot 105)


Pathway through The Village and footpath to/from East Remote


Pogonip Lookout at Coolidge Drive


Stevenson Knoll 


Main campus entrance grass area


Lower East Field


East Field (walking/running track is open for use but physical distancing is expected)


East Field workout area, basketball courts, and all of OPERS


Quarry Amphitheater


Family Student Housing Softball Field


Playgrounds at: Family Student Housing, Ranch View Terrace, Hagar Court


Rachel Carson College: Tennis Courts, Basketball Courts and adjacent grass area


Oakes College: Lower West Field 


Although campus trails are now accessible, restrictions remain in effect for areas where group gatherings may occur or areas where we have had challenges with people practicing physical distancing as provided in the county order. Additionally, access to playgrounds and other recreational equipment has been restricted due to the challenges of ensuring adequate sanitization of equipment. These restrictions will be in place until the campus determines it is appropriate to reopen these locations. We will continue to monitor and reassess these decisions based on state and local guidance.
I am so grateful for all of our employees who are working diligently to implement and monitor our compliance with these directives. As state, county and campus guidance and mandates continue to adapt, we will update the campus community with changes.",870,cal,5
Santa Cruz,4-May-2020,"Supporting our students with CARES funding
To: UC Santa Cruz Undergraduate and Graduate Students
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive
May 04, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
Dear Campus Community,
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed into law in early April provides UC Santa Cruz with $19.3 million to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic on the university and its students. At least half of the institution’s allocation will go directly to students via the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office (FASO) to help with expenses related to COVID-19, including costs for housing, food, course materials, technology, health care, and childcare. The remainder of the funding will mitigate unexpected university costs associated with transitioning to remote instruction and remote work, as well as loss of revenue associated with housing, among others.
The emergency financial aid grants will be advanced directly to undergraduates and graduate students with the most need for their expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses.   
In determining the principles for allocation of CARES Act grants, the FASO consulted with campus leaders, including the Student Union Assembly (SUA) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA), on how best to award funds within the Department of Education regulations. We chose not to require an additional application to ensure we can streamline the awarding process. Graduate students who have submitted a FAFSA to UCSC anytime since 2005 were considered eligible. Spring quarter awards will range from $500 to $1,400. Students identified for an award will receive an email in the next few days to ensure they have direct deposit set up. A few days later, the awards will be disbursed. In addition, CARES Act grant-eligible students who enroll in 6 or more credits in summer session will receive $500. These are one-time grant awards that do not need to be paid back. 
The campus will also provide awards aligned with the same principles and priorities to students who have submitted the California Dream Application. 
Any student (resident, international, out of state, undocumented, with or without a financial aid application, etc.) experiencing a financial emergency is encouraged to contact Slug Support.
Our thoughts are with all members of the UC Santa Cruz community as together we face the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hope that you stay safe, stay well and stay connected.",400,cal,5
Santa Cruz,4-May-2020,"Recovery planning
To: UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive
May 04, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
I am so grateful to our staff and faculty for your dedication to our campus, our students, and our mission. You have continually modeled innovation and hard work as we face unprecedented challenges as our campus continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Your commitment and ability to build communities of learning across distance continues to inspire me and makes me proud to be a member of the UC Santa Cruz community

Budget Impacts and Uncertainty

There are a number of factors that will contribute to the fiscal impacts on our campus and California as a result of COVID-19. We do not yet know what kinds of instruction will be possible in the fall; we cannot forecast with any certainty how our operations will look as we start our next academic year; and we do not yet know our fall enrollments. The state budget for the next fiscal year and the associated investment in the University of California will not be known until at least September. This period of budget uncertainty and concerns about revenue losses will likely continue beyond the 2020-21 academic year. In addition, depending on the future trajectory of COVID-19 and the potential for resurgence, there could be additional waves of impact. In order to prepare for a variety of scenarios that could emerge, we are deeply engaged in developing plans that provide good fiscal, public health, and safety stewardship and will continue to develop, refine and share these plans as information becomes available.

Workforce Planning

This high degree of budget uncertainty has led to concern about layoffs. As you know, President Naplitano and the 10 campus Chancellors sent out a communication in March stating a commitment to no COVID-19 related layoffs through the rest of the current fiscal year. At this point we do not have enough budget information to say definitively what may happen in regard to layoffs after July 1, 2020. I know this message does not bring reassurance, but I offer it in the spirit of transparency. Many have asked if voluntary pay cuts or similar actions could be implemented to minimize the potential for layoffs or other budget cuts. All of these possibilities are on the table. We are working with the Office of the President and the other UC campuses to coordinate efforts to address potential budget shortfalls.

CARES Act Funding

Universities and colleges are receiving limited federal funding to assist with the fiscal impact of COVID-19. Through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, UC Santa Cruz has been allocated $19.3 million. Federal guidelines state that these funds must go toward expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus. One-half of these funds must be awarded directly to students in the form of emergency financial aid grants. Students will receive a follow-up email explaining this process. The remaining half (approximately $9.6M) are to cover costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction. Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, working with the academic leadership team, will recommend how these funds should be directed per federal guidelines. I share with others the hope that there will be additional COVID-19 federal legislation, but it is not yet clear what kinds of financial relief will come to the University of California or UC Santa Cruz. The campus is also tracking all expenses for other kinds of support, through agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Planning for Recovery

Though we face uncertainty about many elements of our operations, we are actively engaging in planning to identify how we can and should respond based on various scenarios. As part of this work, I have asked the campus leadership team to think through how their operations and finances would be impacted by various scenarios including permanent campus budget reductions of 5, 10 and 15 percent. I have also asked them to identify the opportunities for revenue generation or other operational efficiencies that could mitigate possible budget cuts. We are developing a set of principles to guide this work so that our mission and goals continue to guide our budget decisions. We will share information about these principles as this work continues.

Recovery and Resiliency Committee Structure

Scenario planning is the basis for the recovery and resiliency work moving forward in response to COVID-19. The health and safety of our campus community is our top priority in this work. I have appointed a Recovery and Resiliency Steering Committee to guide the work of the two task forces.

The first task force is focused on Academic Recovery and Resiliency, and is chaired by Lori Kletzer. The focus of this group is identifying the possible modalities of our teaching, learning, and research, and related student affairs, housing and residential life operations for the coming 2020-21 academic year.  

The second task force is focused on Operations and Employee Recovery and Resiliency, and is chaired by Vice Chancellor for Business and Administration Sarah Latham. The focus of this group is on community and morale, how we return to work, how people navigate the fears and uncertainties of returning to work, and how we leverage opportunities that have emerged over the last couple of months. This work includes identifying how we can return to work safely and the many issues that relate to resumption of business. As these groups identify recommendations, I have asked them to share information with the campus community.

I know this period of isolation and uncertainty is difficult. I encourage you to continue to seek out new methods for connecting with your peers, colleagues and co-workers. Additionally, the Employee Assistance Program is available to all faculty and staff. Based on your feedback, our Staff Human Resources team is actively working to expand the number of sessions available via this program. We have also launched a webpage that outlines other resources available to you in support of wellbeing and mental health during the COVID19 pandemic.

Thank you again for all you are doing to support UC Santa Cruz.

Diego,22-Jan-2020,"Dear Students, UC San Diego Student Health Services has been working with UC San Diego Health Infection Prevention and Clinical Epidemiology regarding an outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that started in December 2019. This outbreak has resulted in more than 500 confirmed human infections in China, with 17 deaths thus far – limited to the Wuhan region and exported cases in Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and the U.S. All infections were in persons who had traveled from Wuhan, China. To further protect the health of persons in the U.S. during the emergence of this new coronavirus, the CDC began entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan to the main ports of entry in the United States. UC San Diego is working with UC San Diego Health Infection Prevention to identify students that may have an infection due to the Wuhan coronavirus, in order to expedite their care and to minimize the risk of transmission to other students. If you have been in Wuhan, China within the past 14 days and you develop a fever with cough or difficulty breathing, please call Student Health Services at 858-534-3302 or 858-534-6296.

Diego,23-Jan-2020,"We are committed to keeping our campus community healthy, especially during this time of the year with increased flu activity and reports of an outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. We ask you to join us in our efforts by protecting yourself against the flu, knowing what to do if you have flu symptoms and educating you about coronavirus. What is the Coronavirus? The 2019 coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan City a few weeks ago and has been linked to a large seafood and animal market. The first confirmed case in the United States was reported on January 21, 2020 in the state of Washington. The virus occurred in a patient with respiratory symptoms who had recently returned home from Wuhan City. There are currently no known exposures to the coronavirus in San Diego or on the UC San Diego campus. To reduce further spread of the infection beyond Wuhan City, all public transportation within Wuhan City and outbound air and rail travel was suspended as of January 22, 2020. Recently, travel in other cities near Wuhan has been restricted. This is an evolving situation, and UC San Diego Health’s Infection Prevention leadership is in contact with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and county public authorities and continues to provide ongoing clinical guidance. To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information.  If you have a fever and symptoms of pneumonia, such as cough or shortness of breath Stay home from school and work. Cover your cough. Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment. Students should call Student Health Services. If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, within the past 14 days, notify your health care provider at the time of your call. It is important to call before heading into a clinic so that your provider can be prepared for your visit. · UC San Diego Health and Student Health Services have developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff. Flu Protection With flu activity continuing to increase in San Diego, now is the time to make sure that you are protected against the flu. It’s not too late to get a flu shot, which is the best way to prevent the flu and its potentially serious complications. There is no vaccination for the coronavirus. We ask you to join us in keeping your vaccinations up to date, washing your hands often, staying hydrated, and helping us prevent the spread of infections.

Diego,30-Jan-2020,"Dear Colleagues As you know, UC is closely monitoring the dynamic developments regarding the 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Today, the United Nations’ World Health Organization declared a “global health emergency” as the number of cases has continued to expand to more than a dozen countries. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also confirmed that the coronavirus has spread between two people in the United States, which is the first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in this country. The health and safety of our UC community is our No. 1 priority. To that end, following both CDC and State Department guidance, I am directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China, while it is designated with a Warning Level 3 Travel Notice. Each campus and medical center should take immediate steps to develop a review and approval process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential or if it can be postponed. In order to ensure the well-being and safety of those who must travel during this time, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before their expected departure and update this information as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keeps the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as the coronavirus.

Diego,31-Jan-2020,"UC San Diego continues to be vigilant in monitoring the progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) worldwide. Despite the declaration by the World Health Organization of a public health emergency of international concern, it is important to note that there are no known confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in San Diego at this time. However, as the numbers of cases has continued to expand and both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State Department have warned against non-essential travel to China, the University of California has called for a temporary stop of non-essential travel to the affected region. We are developing a review and approval process to determine which travel to China is essential and if postponing is an option. We understand that members of the community are worried about the virus and how it may impact us. Rest assured, your health and wellbeing is our top priority. Our goal is to keep you informed and to provide a safe campus environment for all students, employees and visitors.

We are making adjustments to the protocols to screen, identify and diagnose potential cases of 2019-nCoV. If cases occur, UC San Diego will collaborate with the CDC and San Diego Public Health to prevent, isolate, and control the spread of this infection. The CDC has expanded the area of travel concern to encompass Hubei Provence and created a framework to identify and isolate patients meeting criteria for 2019-nCoV testing. The criteria is based on the highest to lowest probability of infection, ranging from those who have been in close contact with a patient with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV, to patients who are experiencing fever and cough and those who have traveled to the province of Hubei within 14 days of symptom onset. Persons who have traveled to mainland China within the past 14 days should self-monitor for symptoms of acute respiratory infection including fever and cough or other flu-like symptoms. If you have these symptoms and travel history within the past 14 days, please contact Student Health or your healthcare provider. Until you have a medical evaluation, take precautionary steps to reduce possible exposure to others by covering your cough and sneezes, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with other people. This Q&A may provide helpful information about 2019-nCoV. Q Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S? A While the number of cases in the U.S. has risen, most cases continue to be patients who contracted the virus during a visit to impacted regions in China. The first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the U.S. was recently identified in a spouse. Still, according to the CDC risk of acquiring the disease in the U.S. is low. In contrast, the influenza or flu virus is very active in the U.S. right now. According to the CDC, at least 19 million people in this country have become sickened with the flu and 25,000 have died from complications due to the flu. Conversely, there are a total of six positive coronavirus cases in the U.S., all were diagnosed early and have mild manifestations. Q How can I protect myself? A The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an acute respiratory illness.  Stay home when you are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing, not your hands.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Q I am a student and think I may have a respiratory virus. Can Student Health Services help me? A Yes. Student Health Services has developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to identify persons who might be infected with 2019 n-CoV. Please call 858-534-3300 for guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider. You may also go to http//myStudentChart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with your Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse.” Q. Does a student with respiratory illness need to visit Student Health to receive a note to be excused from class? A. The student should call Student Health Services to be evaluated. If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class. Q Should I wear a respiratory mask on campus? A Masks will not protect you from getting a respiratory illness, while washing your hands often and avoiding touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth, keeping a distance from people who are visibly sneezing and coughing will help decrease the risk. Student Health provides masks to students while they are being evaluated who have fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of insurance. Mask use is an effective prevention tool in the healthcare environment. Mask use by the general public has not been shown to be effective. Q I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me? A Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200. Q How are our Students and Scholars who may be travelling internationally being guided at this time? A UC San Diego is tracking the locations of our students travelling internationally and providing guidance to students who may travel to high-risk areas in China. Currently, no UC San Diego student is studying abroad in these locations. At this time, the CDC and State Department recommend travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. More importantly, the University of California Office of the President has put a hold on non-essential travel to mainland China. It also recommends that travelers practice easy health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. Q What if I already have a scheduled work trip to China? A We are currently evaluating the impact to staff and faculty who have pre-existing travel plans to China and will determine on a case-by-case basis which travel may need to be postponed. Please note, you may want to check your current flight plans as some U.S. airline carriers are canceling or limiting flights to China. As a community, UC San Diego is firmly committed to creating a culture of inclusion on our campus, a goal we continue to strive toward and from which we will not waver. Respect and dignity for allregardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability or background—are of paramount importance to our mission as an educational institution. For more information on 2019-nCoV, the campus has we have posted a webinar on Blink hosted by Francesca Torriani, MD, and Stace San Miguel, MD, explaining the coronavirus, its spread and UC San Diego's current plan of action. We will continue to post updates here https//blink.ucsd.edu/safety/resources/public-health/coronavirus.html. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned.

Diego,3-Feb-2020,"Over the past six weeks, a coronavirus (2019 novel Coronavirus, nCoV) closely related to the coronaviruses responsible for the SARS and MERS outbreaks, has spread from Wuhan Province to other parts of China and, more recently, beyond China. We strongly support our Chinese community and their families in this difficult time and hope that this outbreak can be brought to a swift conclusion. With increasing concern about global spread of the nCoV, the US State Department has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (https://bit.ly/2Op1GD4) related to travel to and from China. Under this advisory, all non-essential travel to China by U.S. Government personnel has been suspended. President Napolitano has directed that the UC community temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China. Each UC campus and medical center has been directed to develop a process to determine if travel to China is essential or can be postponed. UC San Diego’s interim policy, outlined below, has been drafted to be consistent with this policy. It is not intended to be a travel ban since UC San Diego faculty, staff and students may have legitimate reasons to travel to China for essential purposes and/or personal emergencies. OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY TRAVEL Members of the UC San Diego and UC San Diego Health faculty, staff and student communities should not travel to China for non-essential purposes. As directed by President Napolitano, UC San Diego has developed a process by which personnel who wish to travel to China on essential business may request designation of their travel as being in the “essential” category. We recognize that UC San Diego and UC San Diego Health are world-class institutions and that members of our community may be called upon to travel to China to assist in control of the nCoV outbreak or to conduct other ongoing critical activities. Those wishing to travel on official university business for essential reasons will be asked to submit to their department head a written “Request for Essential Travel Designation” to include the name and position title of the university/UC Health traveler, a detailed statement of the reason for the travel, the dates and locations of the travel, and a justification for why the travel cannot be deferred or the business conducted by electronic communications. An electronic form is available at https://aps.ucsd.edu/chinatravelpreapproval.html. The department head or dean and vice chancellor of the traveler’s unit will determine whether the travel is deemed to be essential in nature. If it is determined that the travel is not of an essential nature, the traveler can appeal to the Chancellor’s Office for a final determination. If travel is deemed essential, the traveler will register with the UC International Travel Registry at https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html before their departure date and update any deviations from the information deposited in the registry before, during and after their travel occurs. The University will provide support to the traveler according to existing university travel policies for those traveling on essential university business and who are registered in the UC International Travel Registry. Travelers must obtain “Essential Travel Designation” AND register in the UC International Travel Registry in order for the university to provide reimbursement of travel expenses and in order for the university travel program (Connexxus) to provide emergency assistance. When travelers return to the U.S., whether or not they are traveling on essential university business, they must comply with all U.S. re-entry and quarantine requirements in place before returning to the university community. PERSONAL TRAVEL UC San Diego recognizes that many members of our community have family and other close personal ties in China. This interim UC San Diego travel policy is not intended to impede travel related to family and other personal obligations. Travel of this nature is considered (as in the past) to be personal travel. It will be subject to any regulations and advisories of the U.S. government and other relevant agencies. Personal travelers will be required to comply with all U.S. re-entry and quarantine requirements in place before returning to the university community. We look forward to seeing this outbreak brought under control by the efforts of the global community, and we will continue to provide all possible support to affected members of our community.

Diego,5-Feb-2020,"UC San Diego continues to be vigilant in monitoring the progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and is responding as additional information becomes available. Despite the declaration by the World Health Organization of a public health emergency of international concern, it is important to note that there are no known confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in San Diego at this time. Our leadership and health care experts are in continuous contact with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health for updated information on the outbreak. Please join us Thursday, Feb. 6 from 5 to 5:45 p.m. for the campus’ second webinar featuring UC San Diego’s health experts who will share the latest advice from these local, national and international health agencies regarding the ongoing situation with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Francesca Torriani, M.D., UC San Diego Health's Program Director of Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology and an Infectious Diseases specialist, and Stacie San Miguel, M.D., Director of Medical Services for UC San Diego Student Health Services, will share their expertise, and recommendations on preventative measures. In addition, they will relay UC San Diego’s plan to identify, treat and contain any potential cases of 2019-nCoV diagnosed within the UC San Diego community. Drs. Torriani and San Miguel will be joined by Alysson Satterlund, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs who will be a part of the question and answer section of the webinar to address student queries and concerns. All faculty, students, and staff are encouraged to participate.

TRAVEL UPDATE: With increasing concern about global spread of the nCoV, the U.S. State Department has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (https://bit.ly/2Op1GD4) related to travel to and from China. Under this advisory, all non-essential travel to China by U.S. Government personnel has been suspended. President Napolitano has directed that the UC community temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China. Each UC campus and medical center has been directed to develop a process to determine if travel to China is essential or can be postponed. UC San Diego’s interim policy is consistent with this policy and can be found at http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-2-3-3.html. It is not intended to be a travel ban since UC San Diego faculty, staff and students may have legitimate reasons to travel to China for essential purposes and/or personal emergencies. Travelers should practice easy health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. The CDC has expanded the area of travel concern to encompass mainland China and created a framework to identify and isolate patients meeting criteria for 2019-nCoV testing Patients Under Investigation (PUI). The criteria are based on the highest to lowest probability of infection, ranging from those who have been in close contact with a patient with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV and who are experiencing fever or cough to those who have traveled to China within 14 days of symptom onset and who are experiencing fever and cough or shortness of breath. Asymptomatic persons who have traveled to mainland China within the past 14 days should self-monitor for symptoms of acute respiratory infection including fever and cough or other flu-like symptoms. Any person with these symptoms and an exposure to a patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV or travel to China within the past 14 days should immediately contact their primary care provider; students should contact Student Health Services (SHS). Students with travel history within the past 14 days and with fever or cough should contact SHS (858-534-3300) for guidance and to determine if they need to be seen by a provider. Students may also go to https://mystudentchart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with their Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse”. While awaiting a medical evaluation, students should take precautionary steps to reduce possible exposure to others by covering your cough and sneezes, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with other people. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar is one of four military bases that have been chosen to house up to 1,000 people who may require quarantine for coronavirus following travel in China. About 250 individuals are expected to arrive in the next few days and be held in federal quarantine for 14 days. Medical personnel on the flights and on base will screen individuals for signs or symptoms of coronavirus. Any person developing signs or symptoms of coronavirus or with other acute medical problems will be admitted to one of four hospitals in the region. UC San Diego Health will be working with the San Diego Public Health Department to support these individuals if needed. The situation is fluid and therefore be prepared to act should there be any changes to the protocols outlined above. Q&A ABOUT 2019-nCoV: Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S? While the number of cases in the U.S. has risen, most cases continue to be patients who contracted the virus during a visit to impacted regions in China. The first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the U.S. was recently identified in the spouse of a recent traveler from China who acquired the virus while in China. Still, according to the CDC risk of acquiring the disease in the U.S. is low. In contrast, the influenza or flu virus is very active in the U.S. right now. According to the CDC, at least 19 million people in this country have become sickened with the flu and 25,000 have died from complications due to the flu. How can I protect myself? The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Stay home when you are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Remember, influenza is a far greater threat for death in the U.S. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing, not your hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Should I wear a respiratory mask. Masks will not protect you from getting a respiratory illness, while washing your hands often and avoiding touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth, keeping a distance from people who are sneezing or coughing will help decrease the risk. Mask use is an effective prevention tool in the healthcare environment, for patients with symptoms and healthcare providers. Mask use by the general public has not been shown to be effective. Q. Does a student with respiratory illness need to visit Student Health to receive a note to be excused from class? A. The student should call Student Health Services to be evaluated. If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class. I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me? Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200.

Diego,14-Feb-2020,"UC San Diego continues to safeguard the health and wellness of our students, staff and faculty by carefully monitoring the global progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Our leadership and health experts are in constant contact with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health to ensure your ongoing safety at the university. Currently, UC San Diego Health is caring for three patients who were transferred from federal quarantine at MCAS Miramar. Two have tested positive for COVID-19; a third is considered a patient under investigation (PUI) who has developed symptoms that warrant further observation and testing. All three patients are doing well and all necessary measures and precautions are being taken to minimize any potential exposure. As the region’s only academic health system, UC San Diego Health specializes in the care of patients with complex illnesses, including infectious diseases more virulent than COVID-19. We thank UC San Diego Health staff for their critical role in providing care for patients and their careful leadership in educating our greater community during this time of uncertainty. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned.

Diego,26-Feb-2020,"As you are aware, the University continues to monitor closely the continuing developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). This week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice for South Korea. In addition, the CDC has listed other countries in both Asia and Europe where sustained transmission of COVID-19 has transpired or where the virus has spread. The health and well-being of our community remains our No. 1 priority. To that end, I think it is necessary for us to take all of the precautions necessary in this fluid situation, erring on the side of safety. Expanding on the directive I issued in late January, I am further directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice. This currently includes South Korea as well as China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Macau and Hong Kong). For the latest information on travel warnings and UC-related updates, go to ucal.us/coronavirus. In addition, UC community members who are currently traveling on University-related business in a country designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice should plan to immediately leave the area unless their UC campus or medical center deems their travel to be essential. Risk Services units at campuses and Medical Centers can help facilitate safe departures and returns to campus as needed. Again, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before their expected departure and ensure they update this information as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of traveling abroad while keeping the UC community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as COVID-19. Chancellors et al. February 26, 2020 Page 2 I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the UC employees at our campuses and medical centers for their ongoing responses, research, treatment of patients, and service to the UC community and the public at large. The safety of our faculty, staff, and students remains our highest priority, and I appreciate your immediate attention and cooperation to this matter.",378,cal,2
Diego,26-Feb-2020,"UC San Diego continues to be vigilant in monitoring the progression of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). While the news of the virus and its implications for the health of many around the world is concerning, please be assured that your safety and well-being are our top priority. The health risk to the general public and to San Diegans remains low. However, worldwide, the virus has been detected in a number of locations. Most recently, Iran, Italy and Japan have experienced new infections and sustained community transmission of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Department of State have issued travel advisories for these countries, in addition to the existing advisories for China and South Korea. Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing non-essential travel. As the situation continues to be fluid and additional countries become be impacted by COVID-19, the UC San Diego community is encouraged to check: The CDC website for the latest information on travel advisories as they relate to the spread of the virus at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html U.S. Department of State website for the latest information on travel advisories at: http://bit.ly/3a9n8oh A few weeks ago, President Napolitano directed the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China.

Diego,28-Feb-2020,"Dear Colleagues: Given the rapid spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), UC San Diego needs to be prepared should some students, staff, and faculty on our campus be ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months. Our UC San Diego community must collectively ensure that we can still provide our students the outstanding education they deserve. We are writing to let you know that we expect all faculty and academic administrators to take the actions outlined below, for the educational benefit of our UC San Diego students. Faculty are expected to take the following steps. If you encounter challenges, please alert your department chair or other unit leader. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, the instructor of record for each course taught at UC San Diego MUST 1. Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook in the Canvas learning management system [https://canvas.ucsd.edu]; if your course is already in Triton Ed, you may use that platform instead. This will ensure that if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are under quarantine, an accurate record of all assignment scores will be accessible, so that students can receive their course grades in a timely manner. 2. Ensure that final exam papers can be reliably collected and graded, and the course grades computed and submitted, even if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are quarantined. 3. Plan how to adjust course policies related to class attendance so as not to penalize students who become ill or are placed under quarantine. STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, the instructor of record for each course taught at UC San Diego MUST take the three steps listed above, and also: 4. Place all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, reading lists) on Canvas, so that students can access them remotely even if unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine. If the course has a separate website, provide a link to it from Canvas. You are highly encouraged to take this step for your Winter 2020 courses. STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, all faculty are ENCOURAGED to do the following to make it feasible for students to keep up with a course even if illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions prevent them from coming to campus: 5. If feasible, arrange for lecture capture/podcasting of your course. Use the Kaltura tool to create/distribute the videos/podcasts via Canvas. This ensures that the material is stored safely and is available with sufficient internet bandwidth. 6. Make those videos or podcasts available to your department, as part of an inventory other instructors can draw upon if necessary. 7. Ask your department whether previous instructors have captured lectures for your course, so you can draw upon those as necessary and appropriate. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, academic administrators (deans, chairs, directors, and provosts) are REQUIRED to take the following steps. Work with all faculty in your unit to ensure they take the steps outlined above. Make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined. Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or students who had arranged accommodation with respect to in-person. Plan to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support the academic advancement of students from abroad who cannot go home during summer 2020. This should include current students and inbound transfers from CA community colleges. Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already. Make faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed to support current courses. Arrange for key courses to undergo lecture capture in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, and beyond, so as to provide the greatest coverage in future times of need. For assistance with the items involving educational technology, please contact Educational Technology Services Services [https://edtech.ucsd.edu] or the Teaching Learning Commons [https://commons.ucsd.edu]. Thank you for taking these steps to ensure the educational resilience of our campus and to support our students’ academic success, in the face of the challenges posed by COVID-19. Pradeep K.

Diego,4-Mar-2020,"The news of the spread of COVID-19 and its implications for the health of many around the world is concerning. At this time, the risk to the general public and to San Diegans remains low and there have been no reported cases at UC San Diego. However, we want to remind you of some standard health practices that can prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our community. These same practices also prevent the spread of the seasonal flu virus which is very active throughout the country right now. They include: 1) Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer 2) Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands 3) Avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are sick 4) Cover your cough or sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash 5) Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched There is currently no need to cancel classes or other events at UC San Diego. The campus continues to monitor the progression of the virus and coordinate with federal, state and local public health officials so that we remain fully prepared. UC San Diego has extensive and thorough emergency procedures, and we will do everything possible to ensure the health and safety of our community. As part of our planning, we are helping departments take steps to minimize disruptions to student learning and ensuring students and employees who may become ill are supported so they can stay home and recover. If you are considering travel, be sure to check the latest travel advisories at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices, which currently recommend avoiding nonessential travel to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Also keep in mind that the situation is fluid and other countries can always add or change travel restrictions, flights may be canceled, and new re-entry restrictions or quarantines could be imposed. Please be sure to provide family and friends with your itinerary and contact information before you travel. If you develop flu-like symptoms—fever, cough and difficulty breathing—please seek medical attention. Students should call Student Health Services at 858-534-3300 for guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider. Students may also go to http://myStudentChart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with your Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse.” Faculty and staff should call their health care providers.

Finally, we want to remind you that UC San Diego is a proud community of international scholars. We should not make assumptions about others’ perceived symptoms (a cough or fever is not uniquely associated with COVID-19) or any characteristics of their identity (the virus is now impacting diverse nations and populations around the world). We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to each other’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus. Pradeep K.

Diego,5-Mar-2020,"UC campuses, health centers, and laboratories continue to work around the clock to combat the global outbreak of novel coronavirus, including within the United States. From the earliest days of the outbreak, the University of California has been on the front lines of response efforts to COVID-19, leveraging the power of UC research to inform and guide our actions and providing care for affected patients in our top-ranked hospitals. To date, three of our UC medical centers have treated six confirmed cases of COVID-19. All five of our medical centers have monitored at least 34 people under investigation (PUI). Each health center has comprehensive protocols and significant experience dealing with infectious diseases. Even as we care for patients, we are acutely mindful of our responsibilities to our employee communities, other patients, and the public at large. We must take this threat seriously, and we are. Combatting this virus and effectively caring for all patients requires skillful planning and nimbly responding to quickly-evolving circumstances. These changes may impact daily operations and the lives of faculty, staff, students, and communities across California. In the past few days alone, the number of countries and regions experiencing widespread community transmission has dramatically increased, thereby increasing the risk of travel to these locations. Given the rapidly changing conditions, and out of an abundance of caution, I am expanding my Feb. 26 directive to avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to CDC Level 2 (sustained community transmission) Travel Health Notice countries, in addition to Level 3 (widespread sustained transmission) –Travel Health Notice countries. Further, individuals on our campuses with a recent travel history from a CDC Level 3 country must self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left the Level 3 country and practice social distancing. CDC travel guidance for Level 3 countries applies to all travelers returning from a Level 3 country for any purpose, including personal travel. All those traveling Chancellors et al. March 5, 2020 Page 2 abroad for University-related purposes must register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry. In addition, to ensure the University can rapidly respond to ongoing developments and continually updated guidance from the CDC and local, state, and federal public health authorities, I am formally tasking UC’s systemwide Emergency Operations Management Response Team (MRT) with the authority and responsibility to address crisis management policy decision-making and provide critical oversight focused on keeping our campuses and communities safe. As such, effective immediately, all decision-making authority on actions related to limiting the impacts of COVID-19 is, hereby, delegated to Rachael Nava, Chief Operating Officer for the UC Office of the President. COO Nava leads the MRT, which has been activated to implement our Management Response Plan to manage this evolving public health emergency. As President of the University of California, I will continue to closely monitor the situation and receive regular reports from COO Nava. We will continue to take as many precautions as necessary in order to protect the UC community while remaining calm, vigilant, and responsive. The Office of the President will continue to provide guidance as warranted. I appreciate your immediate attention and cooperation to implement this directive. You can find ongoing and updated information on UC’s response to coronavirus here: ucal.us/coronavirus.",537,cal,3
Diego,8-Mar-2020,"The University of California is vigilantly monitoring and responding to new information about the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which has been declared a global health emergency. UC will act in accordance with all applicable public health directives and UC’s guidance, policies and regulations cannot conflict with public health orders.

Diego,9-Mar-2020,"The situation with the coronavirus (COVID-19) is evolving rapidly across the United States. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus on our campus. However, as local, national and global public health recommendations shift to include mitigation of transmission, we are proactively taking steps that will help to protect the community. Campus Status We remain in contact with the California Department of Public Health, San Diego County officials, university health officials and the UC Office of the President. Going forward, and through May 10, 2020, we strongly recommend the following guidelines for gatherings on campus and university-hosted events: Cancellation or postponement of events or meetings that are expected to have more than 100 people. If a meeting or event can be moved to an online platform, then the meeting could still occur. Cancellation or postponement of non-essential visits to campus by groups of more than 15 people. This would include, for example, campus tours and other events that bring visitors to campus. All UC San Diego-sponsored athletic events are scheduled to continue, however, events will now be “fan-less,” meaning there should be no fans at the events. (Details about the NCAA Division II men’s regional basketball tournament scheduled for March 13 through March 16 will be determined by the appropriate conferences and the NCAA.) All questions can be directed to the UC San Diego Emergency Operations Center at eoc@ucsd.edu. The EOC will direct your inquiry to the appropriate unit for response. Operational Continuity For the last week of Winter Quarter, courses are continuing to meet in person, but instructors will no longer use attendance-based points in their grading. Starting in Spring Quarter, all lecture and discussion courses will be delivered remotely. In the context of our campus, this will mainly involve offering conventional courses via online teaching and learning tools. Zoom can be used to deliver real-time online lectures, hold interactive sessions and office hours, or to pre-record short lectures. Course materials of all types can be placed on or linked to the Canvas LMS, including videos or podcasts of lectures, readings, and assignments; Canvas can also mediate tests and chat-based discussions. Laboratory and studio courses for which remote instruction is not possible will continue to meet in person, for the time being. Educational Technology Services, in collaboration with the Teaching and Learning Commons has developed a resource page where faculty can access tools, support and guidance for remote delivery of course materials or instruction. Questions can be directed to edtech@ucsd.edu. Comprehensive information on educational continuity at UC San Diego is available at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html Specific steps that faculty, chairs/directors/provosts, and deans are expected to take to ensure educational continuity are discussed at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/campusrequirements.html An FAQ site addressing issues of interest to faculty is at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html Housing and Dining services will continue normal operations. Travel Considerations All students, faculty and staff should consider whether any mode of personal travel is necessary. We also encourage the campus community to seek alternatives to business-related travel such as virtual meetings or conference calls. Additionally, given the rapidly changing conditions of the global outbreak, University of California President Janet Napolitano issued a directive (https://tinyurl.com/trrhjqd) for all members of the UC community. Faculty, staff and students are instructed to avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be of high risk for widespread and sustained community transmission of the virus. This would be countries that have COVID-19 Level 3 Travel Health Notices – China, Iran, Italy and South Korea - and COVID-19 Level 2 Travel Health Notices, which currently includes Japan. To view UC San Diego’s interim policy, visit https://aps.ucsd.edu/chinatravelpreapproval.html. If you do need to travel on university business, be sure to use Connexxus https://blink.ucsd.edu/travel/booking/connexxus/. If you do not use Connexxus, be sure to register your trip with UC Away. Learn more at https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html. Health and Wellness We understand that members of the campus community are worried about the virus and may be experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety. If you would like counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPs) at (858) 534-3755. If you’re a campus employee, contact the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program at (858) 534-5523. If you’re a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. As a reminder, we recommend observing these simple tips to help stay well: Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough. Clean and disinfect surfaces often. If you are sick, stay home and do not travel. Call ahead before visiting your doctor or the Student Health Center to arrange a time to be seen. Finally, we want to remind you that UC San Diego is a proud community of international scholars. We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to each other’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus. Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UC San Diego at the COVID-19 webpage at http://coronavirus.ucsd.edu.

Diego,11-Mar-2020,"We are writing to update previous communications (see https://go.ucsd.edu/2U2yPXg) about campus operations during the balance of Winter Quarter. While there have been no confirmed cases of Coronavirus on the UC San Diego campus, our approach is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty and staff; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in California and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching and research. All measures are in line with guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health. The campus will remain open. We are taking progressive measures to increase social distance -- that is, to enable people to safely continue with their studies and work while minimizing close face-to-face interactions. This includes cutting down the size, frequency and density of in-person meetings and greater use of virtual interaction tools. Effective immediately for Winter Quarter: Week 10 classes are continuing as scheduled. Awarding points for student attendance in class, whether for regular or extra credit, must cease as of week 10. There will be NO in-person, on-campus, final exams during the Winter Quarter 2020 finals week. Each instructor of record must use either an online final exam, a take-home final exam or an exam-equivalent alternative assessment. The instructor will determine the mode for their final exam that best serves the academic needs of their class. Instructors should maintain compatibility with accommodations previously approved by OSD. In-depth information for students, faculty and staff is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/2U2yPXg Classrooms and libraries will remain open during finals week, for use in studying or working on exams. Decisions regarding operations, including classes, housing and financial aid, will be announced soon, and are being made in conjunction with Academic Senate, Associated Students and Graduate Student Association leadership.

Diego,12-Mar-2020,"LA JOLLA, Calif. – Effective immediately, UC San Diego has suspended all athletic activities indefinitely in response to COVID-19. Earlier Thursday, both the Big West Conference and California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) made similar proclamations. In addition, the NCAA canceled its remaining winter and spring championships – including the Division II Men's Basketball West Regional scheduled to begin Friday at UC San Diego. Update, 3/13: The Big West Conference has canceled all spring competitions. The UC San Diego suspension applies to all athletic competitions, practices, and other team gatherings. This suspension also applies to any camps and clinics sponsored by UC San Diego intercollegiate athletic programs. For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19 and the UC San Diego campus, please visit the UC San Diego web site at coronavirus.ucsd.edu.

Diego,13-Mar-2020,"Conducting Research Activities During the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak (COVID-19) PLEASE SHARE WITH ALL OF YOUR PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS AND RESEARCH GROUP LEADS UC San Diego continues to safeguard the health and wellness of our students, staff and faculty by carefully monitoring the global progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Our leadership and health experts are in constant contact with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health Services to ensure the ongoing safety of our campus community. Details about prevention and various campus updates are available on the campus website at: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/. In order to address concerns specific to research about the impact of the coronavirus, we will be regularly updating our website (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/COVID-19-research.html) with the most recent information both from UC San Diego and from external agencies. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed there, please do not hesitate to let me know. If emergency procedures are implemented, researchers and principal investigators on campus may face unique circumstances regarding their work. It is important to consider how these procedures may impact your research, your staff and your contractual obligations to any funding you receive. All available information indicates that you can and should make several assumptions as you plan for ensuring the continuity of your research. Specifically, you should assume that: Essential research infrastructure, such as power and telecommunications, will be maintained. UC San Diego teams that support research, including Sponsored Program Offices, Animal Care Program, Human Research Protections Program, and Research Compliance and Integrity, will continue to support your research. The Animal Care Program and Office of Environment, Health, and Safety will continue their essential research support functions. However: Some lower priority services from the Animal Care Program and Office of Environment, Health and Safety may need to be curtailed. A significant percentage of your laboratory workforce may not be able to come to work, either because they are ill, or for other reasons, such as school closures, telecommuting recommendations, etc. Orders for critical supplies may be delayed. Some core facilities and other fee-for-service resources may not be available. CONSIDERATIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF RESEARCH LIMITED ACCESS TO CAMPUS Currently there are no plans to restrict access to university research spaces; however, every research group should plan ahead in the event that campus access is restricted. In the event of such restrictions, there will be a need for designated personnel to carry out specific, essential duties. These include those functions focused on support for: Human health, welfare and safety Research animals, specimens, and research equipment including laboratory procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention Information technology services or security Building or property security, safety, and integrity Critical infrastructure (e.g., power, water, heat, roads) Critical business, contractual, or legal obligations including employee payroll In each research unit, specific personnel responsible for these functions should be designated as part of your business continuity plan. If you are unsure of who in your research project should be designated, work with your department administrator or an equivalent administrator to identify such personnel. In order to ensure continuity of research operations, we ask that you identify resources, vendors or other suppliers that are required to continue research during an emergency situation. We recommend that you order supplies well in advance of anticipated need so that your research is less subject to disruptions in the supply chain. WORKING REMOTELY Principal investigators and research group leads should discuss alternate workflows now to be prepared in the event that some personnel are unable to come to work. Such advanced planning will make future decisions straightforward and minimize disruption to research activities. Examples of research work that can be done remotely include data analysis; literature reviews; writing proposals, reviews, or research papers; writing the background sections of theses; computational work; and meetings and discussions. For this reason, you might consider prioritizing work at this time that can only be carried out in your research facility and holding off on work amenable to remote support. Stockpiling results and data now that could be analyzed remotely in the future is a potential option that might create future flexibility. If you are carrying out a long-term experiment and if it is feasible to freeze samples at specific steps, you might consider doing this more often. If you are propagating cell lines or microorganisms that you have not yet frozen or otherwise preserved, it would be a good practice to do so before any research disruptions occur. Principal investigators and research group leaders should consult guidance available from Human Resources on remote working arrangements for all personnel, including graduate students, postdocs and others: https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/. Additional information can be found at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/. All personnel involved in research projects should ensure that they have access to equipment and information they need to carry out work remotely, including well-established VPN access. https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/ Things to consider might include access to literature, to existing datasets and research-related files, and to meeting/communications software. Tools like Google, Zoom or Slack can be leveraged, along with Canvas https://edtech.ucsd.edu/faculty/index.html, our learning management system and Virtual Advising Center. Principal investigators should prepare to carry out meetings remotely. If you are unsure about whether you have access to such tools or how to use them, it is wise to test them now. Resources are available through Educational Technology Services https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/. ANIMAL RESEARCH If your lab uses animals in its research, please consider continuity of care very carefully. While the team at the Animal Care Program has plans in place to ensure continuity of care, please be sure to communicate with them about animal care needs in the event of campus closure. They can be reached at 858-534-6064, or email Acp-directors-office@ucsd.edu. We ask that you work with ACP staff to identify resources, vendors or other suppliers that are required to continue research or care of animals during an emergency situation. RESEARCH WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS UC San Diego is committed to the health and safety of our research participants and our research clinical and administrative teams and values clinical research activities. To ensure safety of staff, research participants and research team members, all researchers performing human subject research will be required to align with the UC San Diego Health System plan to screen research participants for COVID-19 risk and implement precautions and policies. Tools to help you do so, including a script for screening participants by phone and in person, as well as other guidelines, will be made available and regularly updated at https://irb.ucsd.edu. EXTERNAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION In general, we expect that all Sponsored Program Offices will be able to submit proposals as usual, even if personnel are working remotely. We recommend working with your Fund Managers and staff to ensure that proposal materials are routed as early as possible to your SPO, so that time is made for unanticipated delays that might be caused by the absence of staff impacted by COVID-19. Our experience is that federal agencies are very flexible about deadlines under times of major emergencies. However, if agencies are officially closed, proposals will most likely remain in a queue, pending resumption of agency operations — as has been the case during federal budget-related shutdowns. Information will be posted on the ORA and OCGA websites https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/, if necessary. If you have any questions about COVID-19's potential impact on an existing research project, project-related travel, or field work, please contact your Contract and Grant Officer. Guidance from federal agencies has started to be distributed, including a Dear Colleague Letter from NSF encouraging researchers to be proactive in reaching out to their program officers if a research project will be impacted by COVID-19. TRAVEL President Napolitano has directed the UC community to temporarily halt all non-essential travel to CDC Level 2 and 3 countries. You can access the current list of countries where non-essential travel is restricted on the Academic Personnel Services website https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/preapprovalCDCLevel3travel.html along with information about pre-approvals and registration requirements.

The health and well-being of our students, staff and faculty remains our number one priority. The University remains open and operational, with the understanding that we are making some adjustments to normal activities in order to increase social distancing in the workplace, in keeping with current public health directives and guidance. As appropriate for the type of work performed and pending supervisor approval, employees may have the option to work remotely for a temporary period as we continue to assess guidance regarding the COVID-19 situation. As a reminder, our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be expected to report to work at their usual work location. Use of Accrued Leave and Paid Administrative Leave For specific guidance on use of accrued leave and paid administrative leave please refer to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Staff at UC San Diego Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Staff at UC San Diego webpage (https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/) or for Academic Personnel (https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html).

Diego,13-Mar-2020,"Coronavirus: IMPORTANT Information for the UC San Diego Community UC San Diego continues to prioritize the health and wellness of our community members amid the national health emergency associated with novel Coronavirus. The campus remains open to fulfill the needs of our educational and research missions, but we are taking steps to maximize social distance by minimizing face-to-face interactions. We understand that students have different circumstances, and our goal is to provide as much information as possible to inform rational choices. To that end, in keeping with current public health directives and guidance, the following actions will be taken for the Spring Quarter. ENROLLMENT AND INSTRUCTION Instruction for the entirety of the Spring Quarter will be delivered remotely; more details can be found at https://go.ucsd.edu/2vj9RdW Residence halls, dining facilities, academic buildings, recreation facilities, and so forth will remain open and available for student needs and for the essential work of our community. We realize this is a difficult and unexpected situation, and we want students and their families to make the best decision on where to live during the Spring Quarter. If enrolled, students will have to make a choice on where to live. To assist in making that decision, we offer information, including impact on financial aid computation, for consideration at this site: https://go.ucsd.edu/2QdKMII International students may face different circumstances depending upon their country of origin. Information is available at this site: https://ispo.ucsd.edu/news/coronavirusinfo.html Decisions regarding commencement exercises will be determined at a later date. HOUSING UC San Diego on-campus housing communities will remain open and operational for Spring Quarter. Housing, Dining and Hospitality (HDH) and Residential Life will continue to support students who choose to reside on campus. Undergraduate and graduate residents who choose to complete their academic quarter remotely and would like to move out of campus housing should do so by March 29. More information about opting out of your contract can be found at this link: https://hdhhome.ucsd.edu/hdh-covid-19-faq.html TUITION & FEES Consistent with guidance from the UC Office of the President, for all enrolled students, tuition and fees remain unchanged as the campus remains operational. HEALTH AND WELLNESS Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms associated with the virus, chiefly a cough, fever and shortness of breath, should contact their healthcare provider. If you choose to go to an urgent care center or emergency department, call ahead and let them know you are coming. A key component of reducing the spread of the virus is the isolation of individuals known to be infected with the virus as well as those who are awaiting test results. The campus is committed to providing as much support as we can to our resident students. If Student Health Services determines that a student meets criteria for isolation, units on campus have been identified that will safely provide the necessary isolation needs as well as nutrition and other support services. There are, however, only a limited number of these units, and it is possible that widespread illness could overwhelm those resources, so students should bear that risk in mind when assessing their housing options. Please continue to check the UC San Diego Coronavirus website at https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu for further updates.

Diego,16-Mar-2020,"The emergence of novel coronavirus and COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for communities all over. We want to commend our Triton community for thoughtfully exercising flexibility and resilience during this rapidly evolving situation. As a university, we understand the challenges we face in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distance on our campus. HOUSING In order to lower the density on campus, we are strongly urging students who can safely leave to do so as soon as feasible, but no later than March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing. Students should consider living on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who notify Housing, Dining & Hospitality of their intention to move out and turn in their keys before March 29 will receive a full refund for Spring Quarter housing costs. Information can be found on the Housing, Dining & Hospitality site (http://hdh.ucsd.edu). SPRING QUARTER INSTRUCTION UPDATE Spring Quarter instruction will commence on March 30, as originally scheduled. To reduce anxiety and demonstrate compassion for our students, we strongly recommend that faculty consider the following for the first week of instruction: (a) taking measures to help students familiarize themselves with the remote instruction tools for the course, (b) making review and introductory material available via Canvas so students joining the course late can catch up, and (c) refraining from having assignments or assessments due that week. To further enhance opportunities for social distancing, ALL UC San Diego courses will be offered remotely for the entire Spring Quarter, including laboratories, studio classes, small group discussions and seminars. There will be no exceptions. Students will participate in all courses remotely, regardless of where they reside. We have a small window to take proactive steps to protect our community, and we are asking everyone to do their best and to be community-minded. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together.

Diego,16-Mar-2020,"As of this date, the world is facing a severe health crisis in which COVID  19, a new respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, places millions of people at risk of serious illness or death. The World Health Organization has declared that the disease is a pandemic. Declarations of Emergency have been issued by the President of the United States, the Governor of California, and many California counties and other local jurisdictions, including many of the jurisdictions where the University of California maintains campuses or other significant operations. In the United States, where the virus was detected only weeks ago, several thousand people have already been stricken ill by the disease. The disease is spreading rapidly in our communities and, accordingly, protecting the capacity of our health care systems is imperative. Many governmental offices, school districts and universities, and private businesses have suspended inperson operations and/or directed employees t   work remotely in an effort t   slow the spread of the disease, and t   conserve our limited health resources. The Governor of California has called for bars, wineries and nightclubs t   temporarily cease operation and for restaurants t   reduce capacity by 50% in order t   allow for social distancing. Health officials have placed a limit on mass gatherings and have restricted and/or advised against all travel except that which is deemed essential. The University of California holds as its highest priority the health, safety and wellbeing of its students, faculty, clinicians, administrators and employees, and all other members of its communities. The University holds as an additional priority the effective functioning of its health systems, which will serve as critical state assets in the state’s response t   the COVID  19 pandemic, and must be able to maintain sufficient staffing resources t   meet operational needs. As President of the University, I have concluded that critical steps must be taken t   limit the exposure of members of our community t   the disease within our community, t   care for those wh   have fallen ill or otherwise been exposed, and t   assure the continued functioning of critical operations, including most particularly the health systems that we will rely on t   meet the challenge posed by COVID  19. Executive Order WHEREFORE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I DECLARE: On the authority vested in me by Bylaw 30, Bylaw 22.1, Regents Policy 1500 and Standing Order 100.4(ee), and based on the foregoing circumstances, I hereby issue the following order, t   be effective for the period March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and direct the following: On March 9, 2020, the University authorized a grant of up t   14 days of paid administrative leave for employees unable t   work for COVID  19 related reasons. In order t   address the extraordinary demands placed on our employees in seeking and providing health care for COVID  19, and otherwise responding t   this pandemic, that guidance shall be modified as follows: All employees shall be eligible t   receive a one  time allotment of up t   128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject t   the following conditions All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire; The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health; The number of hours for employees wh   work less than full  time shall be prorated according t   the percent of the appointment; Exempt employees wh   d   not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the onetime allotment of the paid administrative leave.

Diego,17-Mar-2020,"Reducing community spread of COVID-19 is a responsibility that all members of the University community face. In keeping with that responsibility, ALL on-site research will be modified to be in compliance with University of California San Diego policies on safety and social distancing during the COVID-19 emergency. This is NOT a complete shut-down of research activity, but a requirement that every effort be made to transition the work of research staff off-site minimizing on-site efforts to only critical activities. Our goal is to reduce the density of people in research laboratories, on campus, and in the community in general. Social distancing must continue to at least meet the levels recommended by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the CA Department of Public Health (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx). When possible, studies should be modified to enable virtual assessments and distance monitoring using video communication (Zoom https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/zoom/index.html or other technologies), electronic data capture, or telephone. In order to maintain continuity of research during this time, research personnel working remotely must work at a private off-campus location with secure internet services. Note that federal agencies are making every effort to respond flexibly to the challenges created by this emergency. The most recent information and guidance from federal agencies and other funders is available at https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/. We recognize that some research requires staff on-site, even during this emergency. To guide our identification of that research requiring sustained on-site activity during the COVID-19 emergency period, we have identified two key principles: 1. SAFETY: To the extent possible, all research activity that is critical to the safety and well-being of the human participants or animal subjects shall continue during the crisis. 2. ETHICS: On-site research staff reductions must not produce or increase the risk of ethical violations during the COVID-19 emergency period. CRITERIA FOR EXCEPTION TO ON-SITE STAFF REDUCTIONS: 1. Safety or well-being of the human participant (e.g., clinical trial with therapeutic intent where withdrawal of therapy would adversely affect the participant or invalidate subsequent data analysis) or animal subject would be jeopardized with suspension. 2. Study is near completion, and unable to be completed with reductions in staff (e.g., finishing research project requires very limited time prior to on-site staffing reduction). 3. Reduction of on-site staff would seriously jeopardize the scientific value of the entire project (e.g., loss of subjects in longitudinal study, missing measurement of rare events, or long-term studies that cannot be suspended without restarting the study). 4. Reduction of on-site staff would pose an ethical violation of research standards. 5. On-site staff are required for collection or maintenance of critical materials that cannot be replaced (e.g., cell lines and valuable biosamples such as surgical specimens) or research equipment or resources. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY all research programs or teams must develop a safety plan to substantially reduce on-site staff and minimize exposure of COVID-19 for those few staff remaining on campus. ALL ON-SITE STAFF REDUCTION PLANS FOR RESEARCH PROGRAMS MUST BE COMPLETED, SUBMITTED, REVIEWED, APPROVED AND FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED BELOW BY 5:00PM WEDNESDAY MARCH 18, 2020. PROCESS: Each Unit (Researcher, research team or center) running a project, program of research or core research facility will be required to: 1. Conduct the decision-making process to reduce on-site staff and maintain critical research functions (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html). 2. Complete the critical items form for questions relevant to their type of research or setting (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html). 3. Faculty requesting to maintain on-site research staff should develop a plan that: a. Minimizes the number of personnel who will work on-site (e.g., 1-2 core staff or <15% of staff normally in a given space); b. Minimizes the person-to-person contact for personnel working on-site, (e.g., through social distancing or flexible/staggered work schedules) c. Has been discussed with lab members to assure feasibility and rapid enactment; d. Ensures that shared and open research space must collectively adhere to the UC San Diego sanitation and social distancing policies; e. Incorporates where possible a “buddy-system” whereby essential research personnel working on-site during evening hours are accompanied by another essential personnel, while maintaining social distancing principles; f. For animal research, identifies a single person to carry on research activities in each room, in consultation with ACP; g. Includes a process to rapidly modify plans if campus requirements or personnel availability change. 4. Download forms available at (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html) and submit completed forms to their Chair and Dean (Division Leader and Department Chair in Health Sciences, Division Chair and Director in SIO). Faculty appointed in more than one department should submit the completed forms to all chairs of their departments and cognizant deans to which they are appointed for review. Plans will be made available on-line to ensure that notification of any modifications will be available in real time. Faculty and centers whose research space is outside their department must also submit the electronic form to the Dean in charge the space in which their study/ program resides. Researchers in ORUs submit to the ORU Director and the cognizant VC. Exception determinations will be made by Chairs or division leaders in consultation with Deans and (as needed) the Animal Care Program (ACP), Human Research Protections Program (HRPP), Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S), and other subject matter experts. Senior administrators may choose to rely on an advisory group of senior faculty when making and documenting approval of exception decisions. An independent advisory group to the VCR will be available should this process not result in consensus. We appreciate that the effort to reduce on-site research activity is significant, challenging, and unsettling as is the COVID-19 emergency. The entire Research Affairs and EH&S teams are ready to offer assistance in meeting these requirements and timelines. Sandra A. Brown, PhD Vice Chancellor for Research",938,cal,3
Diego,18-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues: The Committee on Academic Personnel (CAP) recognizes that UC San Diego faculty are currently facing a precarious and unprecedented moment with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and campus efforts to prevent a viral spread. As a result, research productivity, teaching, and other scholarly activities are likely to be impacted. Faculty who are teaching in the Spring Quarter must adapt their courses to remote teaching. Presentations and attendance at scholarly meetings and invited talks have been cancelled or postponed, and research efforts have been curtailed to minimize staff exposures. Community outreach and other service activities have been disrupted by travel restrictions and social distancing measures. Additionally, many faculty members must care for their children and elderly family members due to the closing of daycares, public schools and other care facilities. The overall stress and uncertainty of the situation will undoubtedly affect all domains of academic endeavor. Please be assured that future CAPs will account for these challenges in its review of academic files covering the time period impacted by the virus (where the length of time remains uncertain). We encourage academic units to begin to employ methods other than student evaluations to assess teaching effectiveness, which can be gleaned from the Holistic Teaching Workgroup Report recommendations: https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/387335/holistic-teaching-evaluation-workgroup-report-8-28-19.pdf or https://senate.ucsd.edu/ (see Issues Under Review). In order to fully document the obstacles encountered in academic progress, CAP strongly encourages faculty to explain any negative impacts in teaching, research or service during this time period in their self-statements. We respectfully request that these self-statements be included in the materials forwarded to CAP for review, so that CAP members may incorporate the consequences of the rapid transitions and events into their academic judgement. CAP encourages other reviewers to also take these considerations into account in their assessments of academic files.

Diego,19-Mar-2020,"We are in the midst of a continually evolving public health crisis for our region, the nation and the world. The emergence of novel coronavirus is presenting unprecedented challenges for higher education and health systems everywhere. Campus leaders and hard-working staff at all levels across UC San Diego have spent many hours thinking through the complex issues presented by this quickly changing situation. I commend the entire community for thoughtfully demonstrating flexibility and resilience during this time, and I appreciate everyone’s cooperation in implementing new guidelines efficiently and effectively. We will continue to address new issues as they emerge. CRITICAL FUNCTIONS STAFFING UC San Diego is committed to ensuring access to services for those who need them. Many of these services have shifted to online environments. But some critical functions cannot be offered remotely, including housing, dining, health services, and critical operations such as UC San Diego’s medical centers, our police department, facilities, custodial, supply chain, information systems and technology, and maintenance of critical research specimens. Communications containing safety protocols and guidelines for employees remaining on campus for critical functions have been circulated by department supervisors. Virtual training meetings for supervisors of these employees and front line employees are being conducted to ensure work processes are altered to adhere to social distancing guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html. We are working diligently to ensure remaining staff have the information and resources required to help keep them safe and healthy while they complete their work. To all critical functions staff and emergency operations employees, THANK YOU for your continued dedication and hard work. We appreciate your efforts and resolve. REDUCING CAMPUS POPULATION DENSITY We also appreciate the challenges presented as we follow public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. The health and safety of our community is the first priority, and I want to make sure we are doing all we can to ensure maximum social distancing. In order to lower the population density on campus, we are requiring employees who can work remotely to do so, and we are urging students who can safely leave and live off campus to do so as soon as possible. These actions allow the remaining critical functions staff and the students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing. For the latest information, campus employees should visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19 and students should visit https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html. Updated guidelines from the CDC strongly recommend the cancellation or postponement of events or meetings that are expected to have more than 10 people. Meetings or events with more than 10 participants should be moved to an online platform whenever possible. Technology tools for remote meetings are available at https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/remote-work/index.html. STRESS MANAGEMENT The changing nature of this crisis is stressful and anxieties are high. Counseling services and resources are available. Students can call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755. Campus employees can call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at (858) 534-5523. UC San Diego Health employees can contact the Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. In addition, UC San Diego’s Center for Mindfulness and the T. Denny Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion have joined forces with the Compassion Institute to provide daily streams and recordings of mindfulness and compassion sessions, offering resources and online support. The stream is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/3b21Aua. We are all in this together. During this time of uncertainty, we ask that students, faculty and staff continue to adhere to our Principles of Community, as described at https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html. UC San Diego is a diverse community of students, staff, scholars, faculty and researchers from around the world. We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to one another’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor",659,cal,3
Diego,20-Mar-2020,"Local and national media have reported widely on a shortage of critical supplies and equipment that health care providers and first responders require during the COVID-19 emergency. UC San Diego calls upon all researchers and relevant facilities to come together to respond and reduce this shortage in San Diego by making specific otherwise unused equipment and materials available to the UC San Diego Health System. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT is critically important, specifically: Medical-grade Procedure and surgical masks, surgical and isolation/protective gowns, arm sleeves, goggles, eye shields and face shields. To send supplies to UC San Diego Health, contact Robbie Jacob with UC San Diego Logistics at gjacob@ucsd.edu to request pick-up from your location. Please note supply type and quantity, as well as location, in your email. Please create an inventory of all items provided, and track all costs if appropriate.

Diego,20-Mar-2020,"As of midnight last night, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered all California residents to stay home until further notice, to limit the spread of COVID-19. Educational institutions such as UC San Diego are subject to these orders but are considered essential businesses. Anticipating this mandate, UC San Diego already took steps to suspend all on-campus operations with the exception of those that are deemed critical functions that cannot be conducted remotely. Below is a summary of certain operations determined to be critical for purposes of complying with the governor’s mandate, including those that will continue on campus at this time: 1. Health care services and corresponding support. UC San Diego hospitals and clinics will remain open and fully operational; more information is available on UC San Diego Health’s website at https://health.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx. 2. Student housing and dining services. 3. Classroom and laboratory instruction for remote learning will continue through the end of spring quarter. Deans and chairs will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed. 4. Enrollment management services critical to securing our fall 2020 entering class. The AVC for Enrollment Management will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed. 5. Animal care or animal research designated as critical, and research laboratory safety. 6. Research approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. 7. Emergency Operations Center, UC San Diego Police Department, Student Health Services, and Environment Health and Safety. 8. Facilities, building systems, and custodial services will continue to operate at reduced levels, but surfaces in common areas will continue to be sanitized regularly. 9. Supply chain and logistics. 10. IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning. 11. Human resources, finance, and the Faculty Staff Assistance Program will continue, but operate remotely. 12. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Central Office remains open 24/7. All services are offered via telehealth. To make an appointment, please call CAPS at (858) 534-3755. For urgent matters, in-person evaluations are available; please call before arrival. Students continuing care may contact their provider via MyChart. THE ABOVE IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. Further information regarding the status of essential administrative services will be distributed separately. In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, below is a summary of decisions from our administration. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. EMPLOYEES OF UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM THE RESTRICTIONS BELOW WHEN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. The current UC San Diego directives instruct that you should: CEASE ALL IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION. Remote teaching and learning will continue through the end of spring quarter without exceptions. Instructors and students should become familiar with academic continuity tools and instructors may join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning. Instructors should visit https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources and https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html for more information. Students should visit https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html for all student resources. ONLY STAY IN STUDENT HOUSING IF YOU NEED IT. The statewide stay-at-home mandate currently does not prevent students from moving out of campus housing to return to their permanent residence. As shared earlier, students who choose to move out of UC San Diego housing can obtain prorated relief from their housing contracts. More information about opting out of your contract can be found at https://hdhhome.ucsd.edu/hdh-covid-19-faq.html. Our first priority is health and safety. We are following all public health protocols. As a public institution—and one with capacity—we have the ability and obligation to serve all members of our community in an emergency and to that end, the state of California is requesting UC San Diego be able to house community residents in an on-campus location. In this event, we will ensure all health and safety guidelines including social distancing are followed. ONLY COME TO WORK IF YOUR SUPERVISOR HAS TOLD YOU TO DO SO TO FULFILL A CRITICAL FUNCTION. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting a critical operation on campus. If you do not think that you are supporting a critical function, but you are expected to report to work anyway, you can contact your department’s human resources representative to confirm whether your work is essential. REGULARLY VISIT UC SAN DIEGO’S COVID-19 WEBPAGE AT https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. REGISTER FOR THE TRITON ALERT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AT https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/campus-safety/triton-alert.html. IF NEEDED, CONNECT WITH STRESS MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. The changing nature of this crisis is stressful and anxieties are high. Counseling services and resources are available. Students can call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755. Campus employees can call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at (858) 534-5523. UC San Diego Health employees can contact the Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. You should not do the following: DO NOT HOST ANY IN-PERSON EVENTS OR GATHERINGS OF ANY SIZE THROUGH THE END OF SPRING QUARTER. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU ARE SICK. Students living on or off campus may contact the Student Health Services at (858) 534-3300. Faculty and staff who are sick should contact their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU ARE ON APPROVED ADMINISTRATIVE OR OTHER APPROVED LEAVE. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WORK REMOTELY. Some personnel assigned to critical functions that need to be conducted on campus will need to continue to work on campus, and leadership is working with supervisors to define and identify these roles and personnel. Only these personnel will continue to work on campus. Note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve critical functions requiring on-campus work. We expect that supervisors will work with their staff to update business continuity plans. If employees, including student employees, are not required to work on campus, but cannot work from home due to the nature of their jobs, the UC Office of the President has developed expanded leave policies and employees should consult with their supervisors about use of these policies. Information is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/33xt48y. DO NOT COME TO WORK TO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH, *EXCEPT* TO ENGAGE IN THAT CRITICAL RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL AND APPROVED. Essential experiments and essential research personnel may continue, but only with the approval of designated leadership within the Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR). The Office of Research Affairs is issuing more specific guidelines for on-campus research, off-campus research and clinical research activities, which will be distributed separately. No research equipment or supplies may be removed from campus without the authorization of the Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR). DO NOT COME TO WORK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER INTERNET CONNECTIONS OR FEWER DISTRACTIONS, *EXCEPT* FOR CLASSROOM OR LABORATORY INSTRUCTION FOR REMOTE TEACHING. We understand that it may be harder for some employees to conduct work from home. UC San Diego has procured equipment and portable internet hotspots to help faculty and staff work from home. Faculty and staff can address their needs with supervisors or department chairs. DO NOT COME TO WORK TO RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM YOUR OFFICE OR VISIT COLLEAGUES REQUIRED TO BE ON CAMPUS AFTER FRIDAY, MARCH 20 AT 11:59 P.M. Only come to campus if you have permission from your supervisor. QUESTIONS: All questions can be directed to the UC San Diego Emergency Operations Center at eoc@ucsd.edu. The EOC will direct your inquiry to the appropriate unit for response. These are unprecedented times filled with great anxiety. Please keep this in mind when communicating with one another. We ask that students, faculty and staff remain calm, respect and support one another, commit to our overall well-being, and continue to adhere to our Principles of Community as described at https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone.

Diego,23-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues, It is important that students are informed about the full implications of their grading option and course enrollment choices. The Senate encourages instructors and instructional assistants to make clear that students should consult with their department and college advisors and financial aid advisors about their individual circumstances prior to any final election for their grading options or course schedule. The Academic Senate’s Educational Policy Committee (EPC) and Senate Council do not support approving any blanket exceptions that would require all undergraduate and graduate courses to be offered on a P/NP or S/U basis in Spring 2020. There is too much variation across disciplines, degrees, and student needs to advance a uniform policy. Below is a summary of actions approved by the Academic Senate as limitedterm exceptions for Spring Quarter 2020, to temporarily change San Diego Senate Regulations relating to the Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory (S/U) grades and temporarily extend the deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses and changing a course grading option. These updates are also posted on the Academic Senate website: https://senate.ucsd.edu/COVID19AcademicSenateUpdates 1. Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades The Educational Policy Committee proposed, and Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020, the following exceptions to Senate Regulations related to P/NP and S/U grades in Spring 2020. These limitedterm exceptions are intended to provide more flexibility to students who prefer taking courses on a P/NP or S/U basis. A onetime exception to the San Diego Senate Regulation on the P/NP grade limit to exempt all P/NP courses taken during Spring 2020 from the 25% limit on the number of UCSD units that undergraduate students are allowed to complete on a P/NP basis. P/NP courses completed during Spring 2020 should be removed from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the percentage of courses taken on a pass/no pass basis. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.1: https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2) A onetime exception to San Diego Senate Regulations on P/NP and S/U grades to extend the deadlines for undergraduate and graduate students to register on a P/NP or S/U basis to the end of Week 10 in Spring 2020. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.2: https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2 and 500.E.6: https://go.ucsd.edu/39dBOla) The Undergraduate and Graduate Councils authorized allowing departments and colleges to offer undergraduate and graduate courses approved with the grading option of “Letter Grade Only” on a P/NP or S/U basis. This is a onetime exception for Spring 2020. Additional Information for Temporary Changes in Pass/No Pass and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading: Senate Council supports allowing departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements when possible. Many departments, programs, and colleges require courses applied to the major or general education requirements to be taken on a letter grade basis. It is up to the individual departments and colleges to decide whether to make an exception to their requirements and allow courses taken on a P/NP or S/U basis to apply towards major or degree requirements. To the extent possible, Senate Council strongly encourages departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements for major courses, degree requirements, and prerequisites during Spring 2020 as such actions have the potential to mitigate stress and anxiety among students. Instructors may not require that all students enroll in their course on a P/NP or S/U basis. Senate Council’s approval to relax the current requirements for enrollment on a P/NP and S/U basis is not a license for an instructor to require that all students must register for their course on a P/NP basis in a course that allows for letter or P/NP grading. These accommodations are being made to afford flexibility to students. 2. Deadlines for Adding, Dropping, and Withdrawing from Courses Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020 extending the following deadlines for adding and dropping courses and withdrawals as a limitedterm exception for Spring 2020. These deadlines are being extended to support students and faculty adjusting to remote instruction. (San Diego Senate Regulation 501: https://go.ucsd.edu/2J5AOoK) Deadline to Add a Course: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to add a course is extended from the end of the second week of instruction to the end of the third week of instruction. Deadline to Drop a Course without a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter without W grades: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to drop a course or all courses without a W grade on the transcript (i.e. a drop without a W grade) is extended from the end of the fourth week of instruction to the end of the fifth week of instruction. Deadline to Drop a Course with a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter with W grades: The deadline for undergraduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is extended from the end of the sixth week of instruction to the end of the seventh week of instruction. The deadline for graduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is the end of the ninth week of instruction (no change). An undergraduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the seventh week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the appropriate provost for undergraduate students. A graduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the ninth week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Additional Information for Temporary Changes to Enrollment Deadlines As the quarter progresses, instructors are reminded to be mindful about providing feedback to students at multiple points during the quarter. It is important that students are able to make informed decisions about their course enrollments.

Diego,24-Mar-2020,"Dear Colleagues, As we navigate the developing COVID-19 crisis, many are concerned about the potential impact on scholarly and creative work during the Spring quarter due to issues such as inability to use on-campus facilities to conduct teaching or research activities, limited ability to travel to conferences or to conduct research and/or creative activity in remote locations, reduced access to human subjects, and limited interactions within instructional cohorts or research groups and in studios and laboratories. In recognition of these issues, and in consultation with the UC San Diego Division of the Academic Senate, Academic Personnel Services is implementing the following protective/proactive measures, effective immediately. EXTENSION OF THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR FACULTY AND OTHER ACADEMIC APPOINTEES SUBJECT TO AN EIGHT-YEAR LIMITATION ON SERVICE AT THE ASSISTANT LEVEL: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant event beyond the control of any member of the UC San Diego community, disrupting our academic enterprise. Policy provides that campus may accord an assistant-level academic appointee subject to an eight-year probationary clock up to two one-year extensions to the probationary period; any request for an exception to allow a third one-year extension requires approval by the UC Office of the Provost. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of APM 133 and PPM 230-15, effective immediately, UC San Diego will automatically extend the probationary period by one year for each assistant-level appointee whose appointment began on or before June 30, 2020 and who is subject to an eight-year clock, provided that the individual has not previously been granted two such extensions. Appointees who have already submitted their file for promotion review may be eligible on a case-by-case basis. If an assistant-level appointee whose appointment began on or before June 30, 2020, who is subject to an eight-year clock, and who has previously been granted two one-year extensions would like to request a policy exception in order to obtain a COVID-19-related extension to their probationary period, they should address the exception request to the Executive Vice Chancellor and submit it to Academic Personnel Services via the Department Chair and Dean. UC San Diego will support the exception request and forward it for additional review by the UC Office of the Provost. In accordance with PPM 230-15, an extension of the probationary period will not prevent an appointee from requesting consideration of promotion sooner than is required. Assistant-level appointees should be proposed for promotion whenever they are deemed ready for such advancement. An appointee may decline to have a COVID-19-related automatic extension applied to their probationary period. A request to decline a COVID-19-related automatic extension may be addressed to the Executive Vice Chancellor and submitted to Academic Personnel Services via the Department Chair and Dean. A toolkit and updated FAQ for implementation of probationary period extensions is forthcoming. ""BARRIER REVIEW"" CASES (PROMOTION TO FULL, ADVANCEMENT TO STEP VI AND ADVANCEMENT TO ABOVE SCALE): Senior faculty and academics whose scholarly work has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis may choose to defer their academic review for one year. This deferral will not impact established departmental expectations for achievement during a normal two-, three-, or four-year review cycle. Academic review following a deferral will not be considered off-cycle. Appointees who have one or more consecutive deferrals should contact Academic Personnel Services to determine eligibility. We will continue to provide updates and guidance as the situation evolves. Please contact AVC Cindy Palmer (c5palmer@ucsd.edu) with any questions. With best regards, Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor Elizabeth H. Simmons Executive Vice Chancellor",577,cal,3
Diego,24-Mar-2020,"As we enter the spring quarter, we would like to take a moment to express our deep gratitude to each of you for stepping up to navigate the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of just a few weeks, the rapid spread of the virus has turned a normal winter quarter upside down. To slow the rate of infection and to keep our community safe, we canceled in-person gatherings and moved all exams to remote or take-home format. During this stressful time, students and instructors kept up with their academic progress and completed final exams. Staff kept up with the many operational changes needed to keep the institution moving. And our amazing healthcare team has been caring for COVID-19 patients and preparing our hospitals for an influx of new patients. We commend you all for your remarkable flexibility and resilience. You have truly exemplified the Triton spirit. In spite of all the extraordinary precautionary measures we have taken at UC San Diego, one of our students has tested positive for COVID-19. This reinforces our need to aggressively practice social distancing and to be more diligent in our unified goal to stop the spread of the virus. All indications are that the next seven to 10 days WILL see a much faster spread of this virus than we have seen before. As a result, for your own safety and the safety of others, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO FOLLOW THE CDC’S GUIDELINES VERY CAREFULLY AND EXPLICITLY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. The guidelines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html. Moving forward, below are campus updates that will help address some concerns we have identified. GRADING POLICY AND COURSE DEADLINES UC San Diego’s Academic Senate has approved one-time accommodations that afford students greater flexibility around choosing whether to take courses on a P/NP (pass/no pass)(undergraduate) or S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory)(graduate) basis during Spring 2020. Details are at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html#Spring-2020-Grading-Policies and key points are summarized below. Students should consult with their department, college, and financial aid advisors about their individual circumstances before making decisions about their grading options or course schedules. Faculty should provide clear and consistent feedback to students at multiple points throughout the quarter so that students can make informed decisions. Courses taken in Spring 2020 will be exempt from the 25% limit on the number of UC San Diego units that undergraduates may complete on a P/NP basis. The deadline for registering to take a course on a P/NP (or S/U) basis will be the end of week 10. The deadline for adding undergraduate or graduate courses will be the end of week three. Certain drop/withdrawal deadlines have been pushed later; others remain on their original schedules. Academic departments and colleges may offer courses that were originally approved as “Letter Grade Only” on a P/NP (undergraduate) or S/U (graduate) basis during spring 2020. REMOTE INSTRUCTION, COPYRIGHT, CONTINUITY PLANS, AND RESEARCH Instructors who need to come to campus to record/podcast lectures or do other crucial tasks associated with remote instruction may come to campus for that specific purpose. Please have your campus ID. Remote teaching need not be fully synchronous. Indeed, lectures delivered in real-time must also be made available in an asynchronous format via Canvas to ensure students who are ill or in another time zone can fully participate in the course. For options and resources, see https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu. Total student-instructor interaction time (including virtual office hours via Zoom, Canvas chat, etc.) should fulfill the expected total contact hours for the course; see: https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html#Class-Meetings-and-Attendance Guidance on copyright of instructional materials is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/398MYrG. As discussed in the guidance for chairs, provosts, deans and instructors (at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/campusrequirements.html), each instructor should share with their unit leader the continuity plan to be followed if the instructor becomes ill. Tactics for making a course resilient include posting material on Canvas in advance and pre-identification of potential alternative instructors. See also: https://go.ucsd.edu/2vMx74p Faculty should bear in mind that undergraduate and graduate students cannot be required to work in person on campus during the stay-at-home order; this specifically includes research and instructional duties. AS THE NEXT TWO WEEKS ARE CRITICAL IN LIMITING NEW CORONAVIRUS EXPOSURE, RESEARCH SETTINGS WILL STRICTLY APPLY STAFF LIMITS, SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SANITATION REQUIREMENTS. Specifically, students are strongly discouraged from coming to their research sites; there should be no more than one person per site at any given time (e.g., use shifts when necessary), social distancing should be rigorously adhered to, and sanitation efforts (limiting unneeded touching of equipment, cleaning high touch spaces such as door knobs, light switches and key boards) should be fully implemented. No student (undergraduate, graduate or postdoctoral scholar) should be required to come to the lab for their work, and flexibility should be afforded to the completion of the research projects. Challenges to this policy should be directed to deans and the Vice Chancellor for Research for final management. HOUSING UPDATE A considerable number of undergraduate students who can take their spring quarter classes from home have already cancelled their housing contracts, which will allow University Housing in the coming weeks to take steps to socially distance students in their residential communities. For the spring quarter, students remaining in campus housing will be reassigned from triples and doubles to single bedrooms. These students will not be assessed an additional charge as University Housing moves forward with this change. Students remaining in campus housing will receive more detailed information via email after spring break. The goal is to ensure that everyone is settled by early spring quarter. Any requests for reinstatement of the housing contract will need to meet the following exception criterion. Students should consider living on campus during the spring quarter ONLY if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who are remaining on campus for Spring Break are reminded of the importance of physical distancing to further ensure the health and well-being of our community. Starting April 1, an unoccupied residential building has been designated for isolation housing. We are unable to share any additional information, including specific locations or room assignments, due to student privacy concerns. The university will be in contact with students in isolation and will offer support during recovery. Students will receive all of their basic needs while in isolation, and Student Health Services will advise students to remain inside the housing unit. Resources to support Spring Quarter 2020 Remote Instruction, Health and Well-Being and Community Resources will continue to be regularly added to the main website: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT We encourage you to visit Handshake at https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/login to review NEW open remote positions for student employees. You will find remote positions already posted as the campus seeks to hire student employees to provide faculty with additional IT instructional support for spring 2020. Student Affairs will be hosting a “Remote Employment for Students” webinar on March 26 from 3 to 4 p.m., PST. Join the webinar at https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/262683228 or call 213-338-8477 or 669-219-2599. The meeting ID is 262 683 228. MOVING FORWARD We are in the midst of unprecedented disruption to our society and our everyday lives. With that said, we are so proud and grateful to see the strong spirit of our Triton community emerge in the face of such historic change. Though our friends and colleagues may appear only on a screen, and though our memories of a lively campus—the bustle of Library Walk on a sunny afternoon or the view of the surf from North Torrey Pines—we are nevertheless keeping our sense of UC San Diego alive through many acts of empathy, compassion, generosity and connection. We are certain that our lives will return to normal, and we promise to keep you informed as we learn more about how and when this will occur. For now, please be vigilant about protecting your health and the health of others. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference for everyone. Thank you for all your efforts and your continued cooperation. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor Elizabeth H.

Diego,26-Mar-2020,"In light of the unprecedented circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are extending the 2020-21 CDIIP Application deadline to Friday, April 24, 2020. The application is available at: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html CDIIP provides funding to support faculty projects that enhance undergraduate instruction and to encourage faculty experimenting with new instructional technologies including the creation of digital resources and the development of hybrid or flipped courses. Funding is available in two forms: The CDIIP Committee looks for projects that can improve the quality of undergraduate education, impact many students, improve time-to-degree, and increase interactions between faculty and students. We especially encourage proposals that address the varied needs and perspectives of our diverse student population. Faculty members are encouraged to develop projects with comprehensive strategies to improve undergraduate instruction in collaboration with their departments or academic units and the Teaching + Learning Commons (http://commons.ucsd.edu/). Faculty members are also encouraged to consult with the Library for assistance in identifying topical ebooks, media, open educational resources, digital scholarship tools, and other information resources already available to faculty and students. Proposals for funding are reviewed by the CDIIP Committee. The Executive Vice Chancellor – Academic Affairs makes final allocation decisions. The CDIIP is not specifically aimed at supporting the development of fully-online classes. However, faculty interested in developing online classes are encouraged to discuss their interests with the Digital Learning Hub (https://digitallearning.ucsd.edu/). Alternate avenues of support for course development in these cases may be available (e.g. the UCOP Innovative Learning Technology Initiative: http://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/ or through the EVC Office Educational Innovation initiative: Contact wettouati@health.ucsd.edu or gchemingway@ucsd.edu for information). Application Criteria: Full-time senate faculty who are engaged in undergraduate education are eligible to submit proposals. Awards are made in the form of grants to cover expenses including but not limited to faculty release time, faculty summer support, summer undergraduate/graduate student support, support for Educational Technology Services or other technical assistance, materials, or other justifiable expenses. Applications must include a plan for assessing student learning outcomes and for sustaining the project efforts beyond the duration of the grant. A progress report for each CDIIP award is due on June 15 of the following year. A letter from the department chair and endorsement from the Commons and/or Educational Technology Services are also required for many grants applications (see website for details: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html). Awards will be announced in early June 2020. Funds will be available after July 1, 2020. Please contact John Moore, Dean of Undergraduate Education (DUE@ucsd.edu), for questions regarding the CDIIP.

Diego,29-Mar-2020,"Welcome to UC San Diego’s Spring Quarter. Today we make Triton history as together we embark upon our very first virtual quarter. All courses and student experiences will be conducted remotely to stop the spread of coronavirus. Instructors and students are asked to become familiar with academic continuity tools and are invited to join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning at https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html. Technical resources for instructors are available at https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu and https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html. Technical resources for students are available at https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu; https://commons.ucsd.edu/covid-19/students.html; and https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html. Instructors and staff have been busy preparing for today, working to create a smooth transition to virtual formats. This quick turn-around means there will be bumps. We ask that everyone practice courtesy during the first two weeks of the quarter as we all find our bearings and adjust. We are all in this together, so be kind to one another, help each other over the phone and online when possible, and extend patience, empathy and compassion when experiencing hurdles. RETURNING FROM SPRING BREAK: PRECAUTIONS Campus residents returning from New York, New Jersey, or Louisiana are asked to self-isolate for 14 days until the concern about COVID-19 transmission is over, since the CDC reports that these areas are experiencing surges in virus transmission. Self-isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people for the full 14-day period. Self-isolation may require a temporary move to another space on campus. Housing and Dining Services will be providing meal delivery service for students with a meal plan during self-isolation. Any student returning to on-campus housing from these three locations should log in to the Housing Portal at https://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/currentresidents/pages/ and complete the return form. STAY-AT-HOME ORDER & STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT California is under a “stay-at-home” executive order issued by Governor Gavin Newsom. This means going out for purposes other than ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES is a fineable act with a $1,000 fine or up to six months in jail according to San Diego County Sheriff William Gore. Examples of essential activities are medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to secure groceries and necessary supplies. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities, please observe strict social distancing. The objective of social distancing is to reduce the probability of contact between persons carrying an infection, and others who are not infected, so as to minimize disease transmission. Provide six feet between you and anyone else you may come into contact with. “Flattening the curve” and maintaining the health and wellbeing of our community is everyone’s responsibility. With this in mind, we want to be transparent that any failure to comply with self-quarantine or related orders risks the health and safety of our community. As such, it may violate the Student Conduct Code with respect to Section VII (P) Failure to Comply, and Section VII (H) Health & Safety, and will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for follow-up. OUR PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY IN THE ONLINE CLASSROOM Our goal is to deliver the best educational experience possible, even under these difficult conditions. Observing our Principles of Community (https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) in the virtual classroom environment will help us to create and maintain a positive and vibrant online learning community. Recognize and take into consideration that our richly diverse cultures and life experiences will influence our online engagement. Treat each other with respect and the dignity we all deserve. If you witness or experience online behavior that constitutes harassment or discrimination, remember to report it to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) at https://ophd.ucsd.edu. THANK YOU & BEST OF LUCK THIS QUARTER We would like to thank our hard-working staff, faculty, and student leaders for their incredible work to prepare us to have a spring quarter on time and in a new format. We appreciate all that you are doing to make our remote UC San Diego presence a strong Triton community. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone. Thank you for your continued cooperation. Pradeep K.

Diego,1-Apr-2020,"Times of crises define who we are. As Tritons, we must embody our principles of community and always practice empathy, compassion and kindness. Today, these principles direct us to look after not only our own wellbeing but also that of our campus and the San Diego community. Although this pandemic is one of the most difficult challenges we’ve faced as a society, we need to remember that viruses are not new. We have sufficient knowledge to understand how they are transmitted, how they reproduce and how they change. In time, we will also gain a better understanding of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Science will prevail. We simply need as much time and as many resources as possible to create a solution as efficiently as possible. The world needs your help to “buy more time” to allow this process to happen. How do you do this? Stop the transmission. Educate yourself. Internalize your role within your community. Closely follow health guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Learn all you can about the virus and the disease it causes in order to be prepared to act if you develop symptoms. Understand that you are an individual within a larger ecosystem. Without it, you cannot be an individual, and without the collection of individuals, the ecosystem cannot exist. STOP THE TRANSMISSION Today, our ecosystem, our society needs our help. It needs our thoughtful individual action and it needs it right now. Everyone—campus residents and those at remote locations—needs to commit to more aggressive physical distancing measures, not just for your own health and safety, but also for the health and safety of your friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and fellow community residents. Stay home or in your campus residence. Period. Do not engage in contact sports or activities that require sharing equipment or close contact. Limit personal interactions to phone or online formats. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities—medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to buy groceries and necessary supplies—please maintain at least six feet between you and anyone else you may see while you are out. When you return to your residence, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and wipe down items purchased on your visit. Clean surfaces such as countertops, desks, and vanities regularly with household cleaner. Be sure also to clean highly touched surfaces such as phones, laptops, and other appliances. Laptops, keyboards, phones and other objects should not be shared with others unless they are thoroughly cleaned between users. EDUCATE YOURSELF: SARS-CoV-2 & COVID-19 While taking careful steps to stop the spread of the virus, it is important to continually learn about it. As our collective knowledge grows, we will identify other individual actions we can take to help. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold and pneumonia. COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2. Not everyone who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 develops COVID-19. Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild to moderate cold and flu-like symptoms. But some people—usually those with other medical complications—may develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia. Using available preliminary data, the World Health Organization estimates the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases of COVID-19 is approximately two weeks and is three to six weeks for patients with severe or critical disease. COVID-19 symptoms including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, and/or a persistent scratchy throat appear an average of five to six days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC. If you are a student with these symptoms, contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3302 for instructions on how to proceed. Faculty and staff should contact their healthcare provider and/or primary care physician for further instructions. Visit the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/ to stay up to date on our growing knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. CAMPUS UPDATE: CARING FOR OUR SICK Our society also needs our kindness right now. It needs all of us to care about those who are sick and those whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by the pandemic. UC San Diego’s first priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors. There are three students on campus who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. UC San Diego medical staff are currently contacting others who may have been in contact with these three students to determine next steps. In most but not all cases, testing and self-isolation are advised. Students living on campus who have been in contact with anyone (student or otherwise) who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or has developed COVID-19 should contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3300. To maintain confidentiality, and to be compliant with federal law (see Notice of Privacy Practices at https://wellness.ucsd.edu/studenthealth/about/HIPAA/Pages/default.aspx), we are not identifying isolated students nor their locations. Please keep in mind that just because someone is in self-isolation does not mean they have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or are ill with COVID-19. At some point in our lives, we all experience illness. It’s not a crime to be sick. We expect and hope all Tritons will practice empathy towards those in isolation awaiting test results, those who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 and those who have developed COVID-19. HELP FOR OUR COMMUNITY UC San Diego is also a public institution. As the region’s only academic medical center, we have a responsibility to care for members of our community especially in times of great need. UC San Diego has contracted with the County of San Diego to provide 350 rooms in a new campus housing building that is not currently occupied by students. If needed, one Nuevo East building will be used by the county as a creative medical treatment center that will accept “step-down” and low-level cases of COVID-19 to make room for more serious cases at area hospitals. Step-down cases are those who have recovered and passed the most severe stages of COVID-19. The center will also house doctors and nurses who will be responsible for patients receiving care at the facility. We are proud to be a community partner by providing a building they can use and manage for their purposes. The County has leased the entire building; UC San Diego will not be assigning any students to housing in that building for the duration of the lease. Campus residents who are in self-isolation awaiting test results or who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be housed in a separate building. Because all spring quarter classes and student experiences are being offered remotely, students who had been living on campus were offered refunds for housing if they moved out by March 31. This has yielded more than enough space on campus to ensure proper social distancing for those students remaining. THE ROAD AHEAD From the birth of our experimental campus, UC San Diego faculty, researchers, staff and students made a commitment to collaborate with knowledge builders inside and outside the institution to look deeper at the world around us in order to solve society’s most pressing issues. This poignant moment in history provides a true test of that commitment. We are meeting the challenge. We are facing this pandemic together, in collaboration, united for a common purpose. We are working with the world’s top minds to demystify this new virus and the disease it causes. We are doing our part to stop the spread of the virus. We are caring for our sick and providing needed resources to our community. I am proud of our response and prouder still of our performance under pressure. I offer special thanks to our staff, faculty and clinicians who have been instrumental in keeping the campus and our health system operational during this crisis. I also thank our residence life staff, custodial staff, dining hall staff, student health staff, emergency operations staff, executive policy group, Chancellor’s Cabinet, divisional deans and college provosts, faculty, students, and of course everyone in our medical centers. Your commitment and dedication to UC San Diego and each other are exemplary. The road ahead requires renewed commitment to community. This crisis will have a lasting, long-term effect for ourselves, our families, our friends and colleagues and countless people we do not know. I am grateful for everyone’s continued cooperation. Stay the course, and we will see an end to this crisis in due time. Thank you. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor",1422,cal,4
Diego,2-Apr-2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an imminent and serious threat to the members of our community, the U.S. healthcare system, and the economy. The welfare and safety of our community during this time is our primary concern. Yet in every crisis there are those who will attempt to profit from the chaos and disruption created. Across the Internet we are seeing evidence of organized crime attempting to lure unsuspecting users to bogus COVID-19 information websites that quietly download malicious software designed to steal corporate and personal information. A recent example uses the actual COVID-19 data taken off an identical (legitimate) site provided by Johns Hopkins University. This can be safely viewed at https://app.box.com/v/coronavirusscam. In addition, federal law enforcement and the FTC are reporting a massive growth of spam, phishing, and text messaging, as well as web-based advertising offering false COVID-19 cures, treatments, and personal protection advice. THE IMPERATIVE: PROTECT YOURSELF Do not respond to email, phone, or digital advertising pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rely instead on established, respected news sources, such as: UC San Diego’s Information Page: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/ The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus The UN’s Coronavirus Portal: https://www.un.org/coronavirus While UC San Diego’s anti-spam service has been stopping several large coronavirus-related phishing campaigns, some messages will manage to get delivered. If you receive a suspicious email, please forward it to abuse@ucsd.edu, where it will be automatically analyzed and the results used to prevent additional deliveries. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: PROTECT YOURSELF AND THE UNIVERSITY AT HOME At home, your laptop or home computer does not benefit from the full range of protections computers receive when on campus. Loaner or emergency laptops and tablets are also less likely to be managed by campus IT professionals. Please take the following actions when using a home or loaner computer off campus. If your computer is not managed by campus IT staff, or is a loaner or emergency computer, immediately run the system update service that installs software fixes for known security weaknesses in your software. Apple instructions https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac Windows instructions https://bit.ly/3dKBgHj Install a quality antivirus product on your personal computer. The campus recommends the Sophos Home edition. See https://antivirus.ucsd.edu for more information. When logging into the campus VPN, use the group “2-step secured - allthruucsd”. This will ensure that all of the traffic to your computer runs through campus network-based security sensors. While working on university business, this is the preferred VPN group. UC San Diego Health remote users should use the ucsdh-vpn.ucsd.edu Health VPN (ucsdh-vpn.ucsd.edu) or connect via CWP, depending on the specific instructions you received from the Health IS team. Make sure that all your personal banking, investment, and email accounts are protected by two-step login, also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Most commercial services do this by texting you a short code to a phone registered with the service. Take the time to set this up immediately. With the tremendous reliance on Zoom within higher education, a phenomenon known as “Zoom Bombing” is becoming common. Our colleagues at UC Berkeley have an informative description of what Zoom Bombing is and how to prevent it: https://bit.ly/2Xe9yNl WHAT WE’RE DOING TO PROTECT YOU In addition to the campus’s usual security support mechanisms, we are exploring several additional techniques to identify and block coronavirus-related scams and to further protect university faculty, staff, and students while working remotely. Further announcements will be made as these are implemented. Please feel free to contact the IT Services or Health service desks as appropriate for support at https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/help-desk/service-desk/index.html and send comments or suggestions directly to me at mcorn@ucsd.edu.

Diego,2-Apr-2020,"We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time. The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together. Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time. To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus. To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time. To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID-19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible. While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary.

Diego,2-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues, The last few weeks have presented our campus and community with extraordinary challenges. I would like to offer my sincerest thanks to you, my fellow academics, for your efforts on behalf of our students, faculty, staff, and the broader community. I understand that many of you are also navigating personal matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Your evident dedication to UC San Diego's educational, scholarly, clinical, and engagement missions during this difficult time makes me proud to be a Triton. Together you've enabled the university to transition well over a thousand Spring Quarter courses to remote instruction, almost overnight. I know that making this pivot while also finishing out Winter Quarter and holding final exams in unfamiliar formats was a monumental challenge. You have risen to it magnificently. I deeply appreciate your collective response to our call for educational continuity - the creativity and energy demonstrated as you've redesigned courses, embraced new approaches, and collaborated thoughtfully with designers in the Teaching + Learning Commons and Educational Technology Services. It's also been wonderful to hear about your collegiality in sharing knowledge with each other as you prepare to teach remotely. And you have accomplished this while staying home and contributing to social distancing, as frustrating and isolating as that can be. I'm inspired by your commitment to enabling all students to continue their studies, regardless of their personal circumstances - whether they are ill, navigating new technology, in a different time zone or just feeling apprehensive. As the spring quarter progresses, our students who are facing challenges due to the pandemic will increasingly appreciate your continued efforts to ensure that all course materials and opportunities for engagement are offered asynchronously to all of our students. They will also appreciate opportunities to connect with you via Zoom or Canvas chat for free-flowing discussions about everything from course topics to graduate school and careers. You represent a beacon of hope and continuity for them. Not only have you dramatically changed the way you teach but the rest of the work we are doing as a campus is also more important than ever. The decisive action of our faculty and staff has enabled UC San Diego to keep teaching (https://go.ucsd.edu/33KeDhr), keep learning (https://go.ucsd.edu/346XsGQ), and keep working (https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/remote-work/index.html) so we may continue to serve the people of the state of California during these turbulent times. The research, applied work, and clinical care many of you are undertaking to provide for the needs of current patients, counter the spread of the virus, and move us closer to treatments and a cure is vital. Moreover, doing this in the midst of a crisis demonstrates great courage. Despite everyone's herculean efforts during this public health emergency, we will continue to face a long list of challenges and unknowns as the global situation evolves. Please know that your efforts are deeply appreciated and that you are not alone in this. I and your Deans, Chairs and colleagues throughout the campus are here to help and support you. The COVID-19 Academic Affairs FAQs and Resources page: (https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html) also provides important updates and information on resources available to support our faculty community. With deep appreciation and warm regards, Elizabeth H. Simmons Executive Vice Chancellor - Academic Affairs",538,cal,4
Diego,2-Apr-2020,"As we all move through the complexities of maintaining research activity during the COVID-19 emergency, I am aware that researchers continue to identify challenges as well as opportunities to respond effectively to these times. In order to hear more from you about this, I will be hosting Research Town Hall webinars on April 9th and April 15th to answer and address questions, and inform you about our efforts to ensure that UC San Diego’s research continues to thrive in the months ahead. Please read on for information about those events and other important information. RESEARCH TOWN HALLS Find out more information about, and register for, Research Town Hall webinars to be held April 9th and April 15th from 12:30–2:00pm at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/index.html. We’ll have representatives from the Office of Grants and Contracts, Research Proposal Development Services, the Animal Care Program, Human Research Protection Program, and other offices on hand to answer questions and hear from you. FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES Bookmark and regularly visit our COVID-19 Funding Opportunities listing at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/research-ops.html to stay up-to-date on current opportunities. UCOP is finalizing plans to support and incentivize research on SARS/CoV-2 and COVID-19. We anticipate that once details are finalized, the deadlines for submitting proposals will be quite soon. Open UC Opportunities: The UC Institute of Transportation Studies (http://www.ucits.org/covid-19/) Data Collection Grant will fund immediate data collection needs that either 1) inform broader COVID-19 Response and Recovery research activities or 2) take advantage of natural experiments that can inform future transportation research on themes relevant to the UC ITS research program. Data collection proposals are due Sunday, April 19th. The University’s Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives RFP, available at https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/mrpi/index.html. MRPI projects are multicampus or systemwide research collaborations, and therefore a good opportunity for collaboration with colleagues at other UC campuses to join forces in response to the pandemic. Letters of Intent are due by noon on April 22nd. Additional funding opportunities: Numerous federal agencies and other organizations have issued RfPs for research related to COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the c3.ai Digital Transformation Institute are among those with open calls for new proposals to support such research. Additionally, federal agencies are making supplemental funding available to those with current grants to help cover the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visit the OCGA website at https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/covid-19-updates.html for the most recent guidance about proposal and reporting deadlines, allowable costs, managing awards, and compensatory supplements. Information is available there from NIH, NSF, DoE, DoD, and other funding agencies. Contact your local grants management staff as well as agency project managers to inform them of impacts of the pandemic that will lead to extension or supplemental funding requests. Track closely all expenses related to COVID-19 to assist in the preparation of those supplemental funding requests. In addition to the assistance your departmental business offices can offer in preparation of supplemental funding and new proposals, Research Affairs has expanded assistance available to help you. Contact researchdevelopment@ucsd.edu for assistance. Finally, ORA has created an online portal for researchers interested in pursuing COVID-19 related research to identify one another. Please visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/research-ops.html to see the listing or to add yourself to it. RESEARCH PERSONNEL We know that it takes time to build an effective and stable research team, and that the reduction of on-site research activity required to maintain necessary physical distancing and safeguard public health puts those teams at risk. We encourage all PIs to maintain their research staff by assigning all staff members work that can be done remotely, such as data analysis, updating laboratory SOPs, literature reviews, and grant preparation. The interruption to on-site research is an opportunity to for staff to complete required trainings, or to learn how to engage in work that they normally do not have time to learn. Our goal is to help you maintain the stability of your research team so that when a return to on-site research is feasible, you’ll be able to “ramp-up” without being slowed down by staff vacancies. Information specific to supporting graduate students in your lab is available from the UC San Diego Graduate School (graduatedean@ucsd.edu). Information on supporting other research personnel will be regularly updated at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/index.html. UC San Diego Triton ingenuity and commitment to community are the best resources we have to meet the current challenge. That ingenuity and commitment have been demonstrated across the campus as researchers work to refocus their effort and redirect their expertise in response to this challenge. It’s an honor for all of us to work with you in this effort. Thank you for your continued commitment to outstanding and innovative research and scholarly activity during this emergency. Sandra A. Brown Vice Chancellor for Research",785,cal,4
Diego,6-Apr-2020,"To accelerate urgently needed breakthroughs in the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of California will provide $2 million in seed funding to scientists across the state to help jump-start their high-impact research projects. Awards of up to $25,000 are available immediately, said Theresa Maldonado, Ph.D., vice president of UC’s systemwide Research and Innovation division. The goal is to help researchers begin work as soon possible, knowing that larger federal grants may take longer to be distributed. The awards are being funded by three statewide research grant programs UC administers that focus on breast cancer, tobacco-related disease and HIV/AIDS. “Given that people who suffer from breast cancer, HIV and tobacco-related diseases are also among those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, it made sense to begin urgently directing some of that research funding to this global pandemic,” Maldonado said. “Our goal is to seed work in areas that can have a big impact in a short amount of time and to help the California communities that need it most.” Research proposals will be evaluated as they are received, with priority going to those that meet three criteria: a strong potential for impacting the pandemic in the near term; the ability of researchers to start work right away; and a research focus that will help California’s most vulnerable populations. Maldonado and other UC leaders have also been spearheading an effort to facilitate greater collaboration on COVID-19 research among scientists and researchers across UC’s five medical centers, three national laboratories and 10 campuses. A rapid-response survey of UC researchers yielded roughly 300 researchers whose work can help inform the medical and public health response to the pandemic in areas deemed by the World Health Organization to be of the highest priority. “The adverse health and economic impact of the pandemic, as it plays out in California, cannot be overstated,” Maldonado said. “But the University of California has broad expertise in critical areas that can help with a rapid response to this unprecedented health crisis.”",330,cal,4
Diego,7-Apr-2020,"UC San Diego is continuing to adapt to changes in operations during these extraordinary times of global pandemic. We recognize that the impact of the coronavirus has meant some business operations and staff have been asked to take on significant new work responsibilities, while at the same time we may have staff who are available and would like to contribute their skills to other UC San Diego teams that need temporary additional labor resources. In the Triton spirit of innovation and collaboration, we are pleased to announce the launch of the UC San Diego Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse (T-WOC), a collaboration designed to bring together operations that need additional staffing with those who have skills and talent to offer their colleagues. Managers who need additional help in their areas will submit requests to the Clearinghouse, including the nature of the help they are seeking. At the same time, managers who have identified available employees in their units will submit information to the Clearinghouse including their employees’ job position and skills. The Clearinghouse will look for a match and manage the connection. The Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse is managed by Campus Human Resources through its Temporary Employee Services division, which has deep knowledge and a strong track record of providing short-term staffing services across campus. Learn more about the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse at https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/clearinghouse.html. Here are a few important things to know about the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse: If your department is already engaged in redeploying staff within your unit, you do not need to use the Clearinghouse service. However, if you would like to take advantage of the structure the Clearinghouse offers, you are welcome to use it for internal staff redeployment support. The TWOC program is available for use by current policy-covered or represented career staff across all university departments, including UC San Diego Health System and Health Sciences. Available staff will be redeployed into roles with a similar skillset and title code and will thus continue receiving the same pay as their regular role. The requesting department pays 50% of the salary of the staff member that is redeployed to their area. These financial transactions will be handled by the financial representatives of the loaning and requesting departments (not by Human Resources). If you are interested in taking advantage of the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse, visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/clearinghouse.html to learn more and submit your requests. If you have questions about T-WOC, contact t-woc@ucsd.edu. We're proud to offer the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse as it supports UC San Diego and the people who work here on two critical fronts: providing operational assistance to areas that have seen a significant increase in work volume due to COVID-19, while creating opportunities for greater collaboration, hands-on professional development and cross-training for staff. With gratitude to our staff community for all you are doing in these extraordinary times, Pierre Ouillet Vice Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer Nancy E. Resnick Chief Human Resources Officer",490,cal,4
Diego,9-Apr-2020,"The current public health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will impact not only the Spring Quarter, but also our Summer Session. In order to continue the vital social distancing that contributes to public health, UC San Diego will continue to deliver all instruction by remote means during Summer 2020. This includes all Summer Session courses and Summer Success programs offered by any unit. The Academic Senate has approved an emergency exception to the Policy on Distance Education Courses to allow for remote instruction for the entire duration of Summer Session 2020. Course materials fees will not be applied to Summer Session courses. Enrollment for Summer Session for UC San Diego students begins April 13. More information is available at https://summersession.ucsd.edu. Proposals by departments and faculty for Summer Session courses are still being accepted and encouraged. Interested faculty may contact Summer Session Director, Becky Arce with any questions at barce@ucsd.edu. Resources to support faculty in remote instruction are available at https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu. Support and resources for students are available to https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu/. SUMMER CAMPUS HOUSING On-campus housing will remain open and operational for summer session. Students remaining in campus housing will be assigned to single-occupancy spaces. Students should consider living on campus during summer session ONLY if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who are remaining on campus for summer are reminded of the importance of physical distancing to further ensure the health and well-being of our community. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY REMINDER It’s important to remember that UC San Diego’s superb quality and reputation can only be sustained if faculty and students commit to academic integrity. For students, this means that they complete all of their exams in a way that honestly and fairly demonstrates their knowledge and abilities at that particular moment in time. For faculty, that means that they work to design and deliver high-stakes exams in ways that uphold integrity, and they check to ensure that those exams were completed with integrity. It also means that faculty report all suspected academic integrity violations to the Academic Integrity Office. Students should visit https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-students.html for strategies in upholding integrity and sign-up to receive timely integrity reminders and news about integrity contests at https://tinyurl.com/excelwithintegrity. Faculty should visit https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-faculty.html for tips on preventing integrity violations and sign up to receive newsletters with new tips throughout the quarter at https://tinyurl.com/teachintegrity.

Diego,20-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues: These are perilous and uncertain times. Everyone – faculty, instructors, researchers, medical personnel, administration, staff, teaching assistants and others – has been working diligently to keep the University operating under the difficult conditions posed by the novel coronavirus. We have done so with grit and aplomb, even as many of us are under personal and occupational strain. Alongside faculty efforts, the Academic Senate has been extremely active at the policy level, and has been working with (and checking on) the Administration in adapting temporary policy exceptions. We are all in this together, but we retain our different stations in the undertaking of shared governance of the University of California. This note is designed to communicate in specific ways some of what the Senate has been doing. Senate committees have been meeting using remote technology nights and weekends, both at the systemwide and campus levels, endeavoring to mitigate the effects of the current crisis. Senate input and approvals have been sought by, and have been delivered to, the Administration in an active and expedited manner with notification that these are time limited and will need to be re-examined at quarterly intervals. Examples of Senate engagement include: Ensuring that difficulties encountered in research and teaching during the spring quarter will not negatively impact faculty reviews. Evaluating the Senate-Administration Taskforce report on holistic teaching evaluation to expand teaching evaluations beyond CAPEs. Creating exceptions to policy to allow classes to be taught remotely, while endeavoring to safeguard privacy in remote instruction and the faculty’s intellectual property. Extending the deadlines to add and drop courses and to select pass/no pass or satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades to provide students with more flexibility. Removing courses completed pass/no pass in spring quarter from the limit on pass/no pass courses that may apply towards the bachelor’s degree. Encouraging departments to relax letter-grade requirements. Extending time limits by one quarter for all current doctoral students. Senate committees continue with the day-to-day business of the University (approving courses, programs, curricula, academic file reviews, etc.). Senate leadership wishes to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the committees and especially their chairs. Clearly, this crisis is not over, and the work of the Senate has not ceased. There will continue to be Representative Assembly meetings at which proposed actions and policies will need discussion and votes from Assembly representatives. Shared governance continues and is defended. To remain informed about ongoing Senate business, we urge you to visit the Senate website: http://senate.ucsd.edu.

Diego,28-Apr-2020,"Universities around the world are making critical decisions for the coming academic year during the evolving public health crisis of COVID-19. UC San Diego is making plans for the fall quarter based upon current forecasting models. The situation will continue to evolve, and our plans may change to meet emerging needs or unforeseen circumstances. All decisions are being made with the health and safety of our campus community as our top priority. We know that you have many questions. This campus notice provides an update on current plans, and we will continue to update you as the situation evolves. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS At this time, it is our intention to offer courses across all of our divisions, colleges, programs and majors through a combination of in-person and remote instruction. We are working closely with public health officials and will continue to refine the balance between in-person and remote offerings as the situation evolves. Depending on the public health context, it may become necessary to transition our classes exclusively to remote learning; if that happens, we will notify you as soon as possible. Students will receive an outstanding UC San Diego education no matter the method of instructional delivery. We recognize that some students may not be able to safely travel to campus for fall quarter. We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as part of our approach for fall 2020 in a way that ensures students who cannot be present are still able to have a rich and high-quality educational experience. Likewise, our academic support services through the divisions, departments, colleges and Teaching + Learning Commons will be available in both in-person and remote formats to meet students’ needs. TUITION AND FEES Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services help cover infrastructure and operations that provide important service and support through all methods of instruction. Examples of what tuition and fees support include the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, remote academic advising and tutoring. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the academic year. Campus-based fees support campus services, maintain facilities, and broadly support and preserve the campus infrastructure. As campus operations adjust to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated team of professionals remains committed to delivering the highest quality service possible. Campus-based fees will continue to be collected and will not be refunded. HOUSING & DINING We are working to balance our commitment to on-campus living while also promoting public health and safety during this crisis. At this time, it is our intention to keep residential halls and apartments open, but we are eliminating triple-occupancy housing options to facilitate social distancing. We are working closely with and will follow all directives from our local public health authorities. If public health considerations cause us to implement remote-only instruction, we will continue to provide a UC San Diego-quality education in a remote setting, and we will not charge students for the unused portion of their contracts for university-owned housing and for university dining. We will also work with students to facilitate necessary adjustments to their financial aid awards. VIRTUAL STUDENT SERVICES & ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMING Student-centered, inclusive, co-curricular programs related to recreation, skills-building, internships and community connection will be offered both on campus and online during the fall quarter to ensure a vibrant student community experience. Listed below are links to a variety of virtual student services, remote work opportunities and extracurricular enrichment programming that are currently available to you and will continue in fall. All students have access to the Virtual Student Union at https://www.virtualstudentunion.ucsd.edu a one-stop shop for all student-centered programing. Triton Tools & Tidbits, a new student-produced podcast launched this quarter to support your success, is available at https://shows.acast.com/triton-tools-tidbits All seven colleges offer virtual academic advising at https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/college-contacts/index.html, and The Teaching + Learning Commons provides all academic support services online at https://commons.ucsd.edu/covid-19/students.html Remote student employment options as well as micro-internships have been developed by the Career Center.

A column by UF President Kent Fuchs in The Independent Florida Alligator discussing planning and decision-making for the fall semester.

When facing a crisis, I suspect I have the same feelings and reactions as many others. I want to fix the problem and make decisions so I can plan ahead. 

What?s been so difficult about the ongoing pandemic is that its global and local uncertainties have largely prevented me from following my instincts. I?ve had to learn to make decisions that need to be made each day and then to plan for a variety of future scenarios. My inability to know and control the future is frustrating, but I know it must not stop me from acting on what must be done and decided each day.

With only two weeks left in the Spring semester, students and everyone in our university community are eager for information on what?s ahead. We have clarity about much of the Summer, but for the Fall we do not yet know how we will implement teaching, research, clinical and extension activity or even how we will enjoy our Gator football games.

Hundreds of talented individuals across the university are working to plan and prepare the campus for a variety of possible scenarios. They are working to both model and control the future.

I am optimistic that by the end of summer, there will be multiple breakthroughs in testing for the virus and antibodies, as well as advances in contact tracing. I?m also hopeful that supply-chain challenges will have been resolved.  I expect that during the summer, many of our faculty will return to their offices, libraries and laboratories, and our employees will gradually resume their normal work routines across the university.  

We expect that valuable information and breakthroughs will emerge in the month of May, enabling us to make important decisions in June and July about the Fall semester. We have a significant advantage over many universities with the presence of UF Health and our exceptional academic health center that are treating patients and conducting research. The Emerging Pathogens Institute is a national asset as its faculty model the pandemic and provides the insight necessary for therapies and vaccines.

As we learn more, we will coordinate closely with the State University System leadership and our elected leaders in determining the next steps. I anticipate we will announce a course of action for the Fall no later than July 15, and by then we will have clarity about major events such as August graduation ceremonies. 

I know many students are facing financial hardships due to the loss of jobs or other impacts of COVID-19 on them or their families. We learned last week the very good news that the federal government will provide $15.5 million to UF for direct aid to affected students. We are determining how to distribute these funds, with more information set to become available soon. This is in addition to the $1.8 million in emergency aid provided to students by donors and university relocations.

Finally, our work goes on. More will be accomplished at our university in the next two weeks than at any other time of the entire year. 

Thousands of papers, projects and exams will be completed, despite students and faculty abruptly having to transition to all-online classes last month. It will be a time of great stress, but also great joy, as students finish their classes and nearly 10,000 students earn their UF degrees.

I pray that all our students, faculty and staff will have the stamina and clarity to finish strong  and the continued resilience and optimism to succeed in the times ahead. 

Whether you are graduating, remaining at UF or moving on to new opportunities, I wish you the best for the summer and beyond. I very much look forward to seeing you when we meet again.

Florida,1-May-2020,"MAY 1: NEXT STEPS FOR OUR UNIVERISTY 
Dear Colleagues,

As the spring semester nears its end, we would like to express our gratitude for all that you have done and continue to do in support of the University of Florida community.  While it will be some time until our campus returns to a more normal status, we will soon be taking the first steps in that direction, guided by the world-class physicians and epidemiologists at UF Health. 

Within guidelines set by local and state officials and the Florida Board of Governors, we expect to start bringing more faculty and staff back and opening up more parts of campus over the coming weeks. This transition will be conducted thoughtfully and carefully with the health and safety of returning faculty and staff being the top priority.  UF Health will monitor the process of reopening campus and today will announce a test-and-trace program aimed at identifying, isolating, and mitigating any campus incidence of COVID-19.

More guidance about this gradual return to campus will be forthcoming. 

You may have seen reports about Tuesday?s meeting of UF?s Board of Trustees in which we discussed financial impacts of the current crisis. We estimate that the university will see $42 million less revenue during the spring and summer semesters, with additional impacts being felt by our hospitals and other university entities. Those losses do not anticipate what might happen this fall, nor what might happen to our state appropriations if economic activity and sales tax revenues continue to decline.

As you would expect, the university is considering a variety of measures aimed at ensuring short- and long-term financial health, and we will keep you updated as decisions are reached.

This week, the trustees unanimously approved a retirement incentive for staff as one cost-saving measure, which will reintroduce for a brief time a sick leave payment for TEAMS staff with 10 or more years of service who retire on or before September 30, 2020, as long as they provide notice by June 30. UF Human Resources will share more details about the incentive plan soon.

Finally, we are focused intently on how the university will operate this fall. Our goals are to re-energize the research enterprise, to serve those students who need to be on campus to make appropriate academic progress and to have appropriate groups of faculty and staff return to campus under the advice and guidance of medical experts and in close coordination with the rest of the State University System. The Board of Trustees has approved moving the first day of instruction for the fall semester from August 24 to August 31 to provide more time for the campus to prepare for the return of students. This will not affect faculty appointments.

We expect to announce plans for the fall semester by mid-July. Planning efforts are guided by our recovery planning strategy, a multi-faceted model for aligning UF?s response to COVID-19-related challenges with its short- and long-term recovery needs. A task force of campus leaders charged with developing this framework includes representatives from UF Health, the President?s cabinet, campus academic leaders and others who will address these important issues. More information about our institutional planning can be found here: http://www.ufl.edu/health-updates/institutional-recovery-strategy/

In the weeks ahead, we expect that federal, state and local leaders will regularly update the guidelines under which we all operate. UF will develop, implement and continually refine our own health- and science-driven plans over the coming months to thoughtfully and gradually return to more normal campus activity within those government guidelines. 

Again, thank you for all that you are doing, and we pledge to regularly communicate with you as we advance the university?s plans for summer and fall.

Florida,1-May-2020,"MAY 1: UF HEALTH TO PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS TEST-AND-TRACE PROGRAM TO HELP REOPEN UNIVERSITY 

View the video here: https://youtu.be/ZWh1UmhIEDc

University of Florida Health is rolling out plans for a rigorous ?test-and-trace? program to support the staged reopening of the UF, an expansive data-driven effort that will allow students, faculty and staff to return to campus as safely as possible while minimizing the risk of infection from the novel coronavirus.

The program builds on UF Health?s enormous expertise and capacity to combat the spread of the coronavirus, providing a pragmatic framework to guide decisionmaking and allow the university family to gradually return to campus with confidence.

UF Health infectious disease specialists point out that scientific evidence and modeling show that new infections can be controlled and reduced to manageable levels by expanded testing and then quickly isolating those who are infected by the coronavirus.

Teams of UF epidemiologists also will stand ready to immediately trace the contacts of any member of the university community who tests positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Testing will be conducted on these contacts, and they, too, will be isolated if they are found to carry the coronavirus.

UF Health is setting up what is essentially a free-standing public health disease surveillance unit operating in collaboration with and under the authority of the Florida Department of Health.

UF leaders say the approach guides decisions that will be grounded in science.

?We are following public health principles that have long proved to be effective in mitigating the spread of infectious disease,? said David Nelson, M.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health. ?We are not helpless in the face of the coronavirus. We can begin to return to our classrooms and our offices and our laboratories. But we need to do so smartly and with an eye toward protecting the most vulnerable among us.?

To that end, over the course of the next several months UF Health will be expanding testing to a wider array of people in the university community, including those who are asymptomatic but might be carriers of coronavirus, UF Health officials say, with more information to come soon.

A critical component of testing is the quick return of results, typically 12 hours or less for tests conducted and processed by UF Health. That allows for individuals who test positive to be quickly quarantined and their interactions with others investigated.

Contact tracing is a concept as old as the study of infectious disease. It involves some basic detective work and time-tested principles of epidemiology.

Students, faculty or staff who test positive for coronavirus will be interviewed by UF Health personnel trained in epidemiology or public health to identify as many of their recent contacts as possible. Roommates. Boyfriends or girlfriends. Acquaintances. The mechanic who fixed their car. A landlord who collected the rent. And so on.

One study shows that if 20% or more of the contacts of a symptomatic person are traced and put into quarantine, then an epidemic can be controlled and the chances of a ?second wave? can be reduced significantly.

?It is important to recognize that there isn?t a fire-breathing dragon in our front yard ready to devour us,? said Michael Lauzardo, M.D., deputy director of the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute and a specialist in infectious disease. ?Data are clearly showing, from a public health perspective, we need not stay in total lockdown. Test-and-trace will put the brakes on the inevitable spread of the virus.?

Not only will test-and-trace allow for the staged reopening of UF over the coming weeks, the data and experience can be a resource for the entire State University System.

At some point, antibody testing might also be of use to identify those who have already been exposed to the coronavirus. But antibody testing is not as simple as it sounds and there is still uncertainty about its usefulness, as there is reason to believe that just because someone has antibodies does not mean they cannot get or spread the infection again at some point in the future.

To be sure, as social distancing and stay-at-home orders are relaxed, there invariably will be an increase in cases of COVID-19. While the numbers of infected Floridians will decline as long as social distancing is in place, new cases will occur as those rules are relaxed. It is clear, said Lauzardo, the risk of infection will not entirely disappear.

Indeed, tighter social distancing might resume on campus if the number of coronavirus cases increases to a certain level.

A key to reopening UF is that UF Health Shands Hospital is well-positioned with supplies and patient capacity to treat anyone who requires hospitalization.

While few cases would be anticipated on campus with an aggressive test-and-trace program in place, it is important that the health system remain vigilant, health leaders say.

Numbers provide cause for optimism. In Florida, as of April 21, no Florida resident under the age of 25 has died from COVID-19.

University officials also are exploring options for the most vulnerable individuals to continue to social distance and have the option of working or taking classes online. That may include those over the age of 65 or anyone with underlying health conditions that make them particularly susceptible to a severe case of COVID-19, such as heart disease or diabetes.

?The goal of test and trace is not to prevent all cases of COVID on campus ? that is impossible ? but to slow the spread and to allow us to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the hospital and health care system from becoming overwhelmed,? said Lauzardo.",939,fl,5

Florida,12-May-2020,"MAY 12: REVISED TRAVEL POLICY 
On March 16, 2020, President Fuchs prohibited non-essential university travel. Travel that was deemed essential needed approval by a Senior Vice President or Vice President. Employees were strongly encouraged to minimize personal travel.

This memo modifies that policy as follows.

As UF reopens and reengages with other universities, industries, research and instructional initiatives, and governmental agencies, it is to be expected that members of the community will engage in additional travel closely tied to these activities. Consequently, essential travel directly connected to assigned university duties will be approved by the Dean of a College (or analogous Director in certain units), a Senior Vice President, or Vice President. At this time and until further notice, Deans and Directors may not delegate this responsibility to Department Chairs. No travel reimbursements will be issued without that approval.

Employees are still strongly encouraged to minimize personal travel.

Employees who do travel should inform themselves about restrictions and quarantines either in the areas to which they travel or requirements of the State of Florida and the University of Florida in returning from certain locations. UF may require returning employees to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning from certain destinations.

Employees are reminded that any international travel must be pre-approved by a Dean (or SVP or VP) and must be registered on the International Center International Travel Registration website https://internationalcenter.ufl.edu/travel/online-travel-registration. Employees are further reminded that they could find their movements severely restricted in international travel, including re-entry into the United States.",250,fl,5
Florida,19-May-2020,"MAY 19: RECOVERY TASK FORCES? WORK IS UNDERWAY 
From Joe Glover, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs; Charlie Lane, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Dear colleagues,

We would like to share with you some more information about the extensive planning underway to thoughtfully and carefully bring employees back to campus over the course of the next several weeks and join the amazing essential personnel who have worked to keep the university running.  There are several thousand employees who never left campus, but continue to support the university?s physical infrastructure and its functioning.  The university community owes a great debt to them, and we do want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and hard work. 

As we mentioned previously, our goals are to re-energize the research enterprise, to ensure that students can make appropriate academic progress and to have appropriate groups of faculty and staff return to campus under the advice and guidance of medical experts. 

As a key element of this planning process, we have created eleven task forces, each of which is charged with addressing an important aspect of our recovery. Each task force is chaired by UF leadership, and their membership includes medical experts, deans and members of the president?s cabinet.  They have been asked to return their preliminary findings and recommendations by June 1. 

The task forces? guiding issues, missions and names of task force chairs are as follows

UF Remaining Vital and Relevant in a Changing Higher Education Environment: How must the university adapt to a changed higher education terrain in the months and years ahead? What is the future of instruction and research, and how must we retool?  Consider what changes are needed in our current model of delivering education, research, and public service in order to remain among the top public research universities in the country. Mark Kaplan, Vice President for Government and Community Relations
Logistics of High-Volume COVID-19 Testing: Develop a strategy and implementation plan to administer testing and contract tracing for employees and students. Develop response scenarios for flare-ups. Dr. Michael Lauzardo, M.D., Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine
On-Campus Residence Halls, Fraternities, and Sororities: Provide recommendations regarding housing students in campus residence halls, fraternities, and sororities. Consider social distancing standards, related policies, and consequences for not following these standards. Win Phillips, Executive Chief of Staff
Behavioral Expectations: Identify appropriate behavioral expectations of students and employees?both on and off campus?that will provide guidance to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. D?Andra Mull, Vice President for Student Affairs
Fall instruction: Develop a plan to deliver fall instruction so that students have the opportunity to make appropriate academic progress to graduation. Consider, in particular, how  to conduct experiential classes such as laboratories, music classes and clinical experiences. Andy McCollough, Associate Provost for Teaching and Technology
University Regulations and Policies: Review key university policies and regulations to assess whether or not we have the correct ones in place to address the new environment. Amy Hass, General Counsel
Supporting Managers: Managers may need to make difficult and unfamiliar decisions to deal with new situations. Consider how to provide orientation and support to managers in this new environment. Jodi Gentry, Vice President for Human Resources
Safe Practices on Campus: Consider how , UF can create a safe physical environment that allows for the practical re-population of its campus, both in and out of the classroom. Curtis Reynolds, Vice President for Business Affairs
Re-Institution of the Research Enterprise: Consider how to reintroduce faculty, staff, and students into their research settings and return the research enterprise to a stable state. David Norton, Vice President for Research
Communications Strategy: Consider the types of communication strategies that are needed to inform people regarding COVID-19-related concerns and that will create a new culture regarding health and safety norms. Nancy Paton, Vice President for Strategic Communications and Marketing
Financial Impacts: Provide a variety of analyses that will enable senior administration to make sound fiscal decisions concerning various financial impact scenarios. Joe Glover, Provost
The task force  reports will be used to guide the overall recovery plan going forward. We will make the reports available to you, and we welcome any suggestions you might have for making our plans stronger. Please direct your suggestions and ideas to the appropriate task force chair.

Once again, we thank you for all you are doing.",725,fl,5
Florida,19-May-2020,"MAY 19: STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT KENT FUCHS REGARDING FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS' ANNOUNCEMENT OF FALL REOPENING
?I embrace yesterday?s announcement from the Board of Governors that the University of Florida and the rest of the State University System will reopen in the fall. The blueprint and timeline from Board of Governors? chair Syd Kitson and State University System Chancellor Marshall Criser III fit perfectly with the work happening at the University of Florida, where the process of returning our employees to the workplace is already underway.

UF?s institutional recovery teams have been thoughtfully and carefully working out the details to welcome students back, with the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff at the forefront of every decision we make. Their work will form the backbone of the plan that we present to the Board of Governors on June 23, and that will enable students to return to UF.

Guided by the experts at UF Health, we are confident that we can implement smart, comprehensive practices that will enable a thriving, well-functioning campus and surrounding community this fall as the local, state, national and global COVID-19 situations continue to evolve. As our work to create a safer campus environment moves forward, we will keep in regular touch in the weeks ahead about the actions that all of us will be asked to take together as we prepare for August and beyond, and I am optimistic that my fellow Gators will once again rise to the challenge.?",248,fl,5
Houston,27-Jan-2020,"Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,

The University of Houston has been closely monitoring the emerging outbreak in China of the novel Coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV since its announcement to the public this month, and we maintain regular contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest information.  Raising awareness and keeping the University community well informed of this rapidly evolving situation is very important.  Since the first case was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, there have been a growing number of reported cases including several in the United States.  We have not identified any cases at our UH campuses.  There have been no reported cases in Texas at this time. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers this new Coronavirus to be a serious public health threat, they consider the immediate risk to the American public to be low at this time.

In regard to this new Coronavirus and general preventive measures, we feel it is important for staff, faculty and students to:

    Recognize the symptoms of this illness which may include a high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, similar to what you may feel with the flu or a bad cold.
    Seek care and immediately notify the University if you have recently traveled within China and are experiencing these symptoms.
    Always practice good hygiene, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid sharing food, cups or utensils.
    Make sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid personal contact with sick people.
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, shared items; and lastly,
    Get a flu shot.

The incubation period (how soon the symptoms appear from the time of first exposure) for this kind of virus is typically 10-14 days.  Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections, including infections with 2019-nCoV.

Seeking care

For Students

Those who have recently visited China and are experiencing influenza-like illness, with fever greater than 100.3, and symptoms, including cough, body aches, severe sore throat, or runny nose, should consider seeking medical attention for the possibility of the flu, especially if symptoms worsen.  You can contact the Student Health Center at 713-743-5151 and identify yourself as having flu-like symptoms.  You may also consult with your regular health care provider or seek treatment at a local health center if you are overseas.

Faculty and staff who are ill with flu-like symptoms should stay home and contact their personal physician for further advice.

Travel

The University encourages the UH Community to heed U.S. Government warnings related to travel in China due to the uncertainty about where and how rapidly the virus is spreading, as well as limited capacity to assist travelers impacted by travel disruption or quarantine while abroad. The CDC currently recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to the Hubei Province, China including Wuhan and follow new developments at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/china#travel-notices. In addition, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Travel Advisory to reconsider travel to China.

For additional information about Coronavirus, including signs and symptoms, transmission and risk of exposure, and what to do if you are exhibiting symptoms, please refer to the links below.  The CDC’s website and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will also issue guidance for those planning to travel or who have recently returned.

Houston,28-Jan-2020,"Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,

At this time, the University of Houston System is prohibiting all travel to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and non-essential travel to China outside of Hubei Province in adherence to U.S. Federal Government travel warnings resulting from the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV.

While the UH System places great value in our work and on our many partnerships in China, including exchange programs, and intends to continue these initiatives, our highest priority is the health and wellbeing of our UH System Community. At this time, the health risks associated with the uncertainty about where in China and how rapidly the virus is spreading, outweigh our institutions’ academic and research endeavors and necessitate travel restrictions.

On Jan. 27, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory to China, recommending reconsideration of travel to anywhere in that country, as well as a Level 4 Travel Advisory to completely restrict travel to Wuhan and Hubei Province. On Jan. 23, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan and Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions in the area.

Also on Jan. 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended its Warning Level 3 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where the first case of the new Coronavirus was identified, to now include all of China. A Warning Level 3 instructs individuals to “avoid all non-essential travel to this destination. The outbreak is of high risk to travelers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk.”

The UH System remains in close contact with our federal, state and local government partners and will continue to monitor this situation closely. While we regret any temporary disruptions to our endeavors in the region, we look forward to fully re-engaging at such time the health risk to our UH System Community associated with the new Coronavirus has diminished.

Houston,2-Mar-2020,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,

The University of Houston continues to closely monitor the global outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease. We will continue to keep our community informed as developments occur. To date, we have not identified any cases at our UH campuses. However, as Coronavirus has become much more prominent in the United States and has begun to spread more rapidly through parts of Europe and Asia, it is incumbent upon all of us to remain aware and vigilant of this potentially serious public health threat.

Travel

The UH System is restricting travel to all countries for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Warning to avoid all nonessential travel related to Coronavirus. The CDC applies this warning to countries in which there is widespread community transmission. At this time, the CDC has issued the Level 3 Travel Warning to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Due to rapidly changing conditions, anyone considering international travel is advised to monitor the CDC’s website for the latest updates regarding travel and COVID-19.

As Spring Break approaches, the University further recommends that everyone in the UH Community examine your personal travel plans and make changes or take precautions where necessary. The University encourages the UH Community to heed all U.S. Government travel warnings related to the novel coronavirus. In recent days, both the CDC and U.S. Department of State have expanded their warnings. Refer to these links to view the latest warnings:

About Coronavirus

Prevention continues to be the best protection for this as well as reducing your chance of contracting other respiratory illnesses caused by influenza, parainfluenza and RSV viruses. This includes staying home when you are sick, which cannot be emphasized enough. Professors will be flexible with students missing instruction or in-class assignments and tests.

In regard to this new Coronavirus and general preventive measures, we feel it is important for staff, faculty and students to:

    Always practice good hygiene: wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid sharing food, cups or utensils.
    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
    Make sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid personal contact with sick people.
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
    Get a flu shot.
    Recognize the symptoms of this illness which may include a high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, similar to what you may feel with the flu or a bad cold.
    Seek care and immediately notify the University Student Health Center and your health care provider if you have recently traveled to any country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Warning and are experiencing these symptoms.
    Stay home when you are sick.

The incubation period (how soon the symptoms appear from the time of first exposure) for this kind of virus is typically 10-14 days.  Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections, including infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Seeking care

For Students: Those who have recently visited China or any of the newly identified affected areas (per ongoing travel advisory updates) and are experiencing influenza-like illness, with fever greater than 100.3, and symptoms, including cough, body aches, severe sore throat, or runny nose, should consider seeking medical attention for the possibility of the flu, especially if symptoms worsen.  You can contact the Student Health Center at 713-743-5151 and identify yourself as having flu-like symptoms to obtain further recommendations and guidance.  You may also consult with your regular health care provider or seek treatment at a local health center if you are overseas.

Faculty and staff who are ill with flu-like symptoms should stay home and contact their personal physician for further advice.

The University remains in regular contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest information and will continue to provide updates to the UH Community when warranted.

We continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities. The international profile of our universities, which includes routine travel abroad in both official and personal capacities, means we must be especially vigilant in determining when anyone in our universities has become potentially exposed to the virus and take responsible actions to contain and prevent its spread.

The University of Houston System has issued a COVID-19 Exposure Prevention Statement It requires any students, faculty or staff returning from travel to countries under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Level 2 or Level 3 Travel Warning related to coronavirus to self-quarantine for a period of 14 days away from campus. This ensures that anyone who has returned and develops symptoms of COVID-19 will not inadvertently spread the virus to others on our campuses.

As Spring Break approaches, it is important for anyone considering personal international travel especially to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy or Japan  to clearly understand the implications on their return to the United States and to campus.  As Chancellor, my number one priority is to ensure that our universities remain safe and healthy.

Houston,6-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty:

There are now five confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Houston area. Should those numbers increase in the next days and weeks, the primary public health effort will be to reduce the spread of infection by limiting the amount of time large groups of people spend together in close proximity.

In the event of a large-scale COVID-19 outbreak, the University of Houston will join this public health effort by cancelling all in-person, face-to-face classes and limiting face-to-face, one-on-one instruction until such time as it is advisable to return to campus.

Should we face a large-scale outbreak, as an alternative to conducting in-person, face-to-face classes, the University of Houston will require all faculty instructors to teach their current spring 2020 classes employing a remote, online format, using either the Blackboard or CourseWare learning management systems. All spring 2020 classes currently have a Blackboard class shell which can be accessed by faculty instructors through the Blackboard Learn portal icon via the AccessUH page. Registration and details for upcoming online sessions, quick tutorials, and additional resources for Blackboard can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis

Houston,9-Mar-2020,"Dear Students,

As we continue to see more and more news about the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus), I know that you and your families must be anxious, because we all are. As I assured you last Wednesday, we continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities.  There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 on our campuses; however, there have been some cases identified in and around Houston. According to reports, all of these cases involve foreign travel.

It is the time to exercise prevention, not panic. The safety of our faculty, staff and students is our top priority. We must take all necessary precautions suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but we must also commit to playing our role in containing the outbreak of the virus in our community. With this in mind, I am providing you with the following information.

Communication regarding COVID-19

The UH Health Liaison, Dr. Vanessa Tilney and the UH Office of Emergency Management continue to work with local, state and national authorities on a daily basis. Any and all updates related to the university’s operations will be available on the UH COVID-19 (Coronavirus) webpage which you can access from uh.edu.  You will receive emails and alerts as necessary but I am asking you to please keep checking updates on the webpage because this situation can change rapidly.

Travel is restricted

The University of Houston is now restricting all international travel at least through the end of March and is continuing to require off-campus self-quarantine of 14 days for traveling to any country on CDC’s travel warning list at Level 2 or Level 3 for COVID-19.  Written approval is required before any student may return to campus after self-quarantine. For your own safety and the safety of those around you, please consider your risks and options carefully when making decisions regarding personal travel.  If you must travel abroad (to any international location), you are instructed to register on the UH COVID-19 website.

Classes will continue

Classes are continuing in their current formats at this time.   At some point in the future, we may decide offering some or all classes online is the appropriate decision to make for the safety of our faculty, staff and students.  We will certainly move to online instruction immediately if instructed by local, state or national authorities and will update you with logistics as necessary.

Community responsibility

You should act responsibly as a community member if you are sick.  If you have a cough, fever, shortness of breath or other symptoms of contagious illness, you should seek medical attention to ensure it is safe for you to attend class and be on campus.

There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 on our campuses; however, there have been some cases identified in and around Houston. According to reports, all of these cases involve foreign travel. With this in mind and after extensive consultation, I am asking that you please adhere to the following.

Travel restrictions through March

    Refrain from all international travel. The University of Houston is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.
    Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please  evaluate your options carefully. 
    Consider your risks and options when making decisions about personal travel.
    Self-quarantine for 14 days if you have traveled abroad to a country for which the CDC has issued a Level 2 or 3 travel warning for COVID-19. It applies to all travel, personal or professional, since February 25th.
    Register yourself on university’s COVID-19 website if you have taken or will take any international travel – professional or personal—since January 31st.

Continuity of Classes

    In adherence to university policies, each college/department has a “Continuity of Operations Plan” on file.  Provost Short has asked deans and department chairs to ensure that everyone is familiar with their plan and that classes could continue if we have to limit access to campuses.
    In certain circumstances and if instructed by local, state or federal authorities, all in-person classes may migrate to the digital platform.  In cases where pedagogy is not suitable for online instruction, individual faculty should make alternative arrangements so the semester is not disrupted. Every course already has a shell on Blackboard; however if you need any help, workshops are offered by the Office of the Provost.
    We will keep small computer equipped areas on campus open for those students who do not have access to a laptop.

Continuity of Research

    Please evaluate your needs in relation to your research. Since every researcher has different needs, please make sure that your dean and department chair are aware of your situation so that appropriate accommodations can be made. 
    You may also contact the Division of Research for any questions and/or concerns.
    Additional information for researchers will be forthcoming from the Provost and Vice President for Research.

Continuity of Other Campus Operations

    Each support unit will evaluate its “Continuity of Operations Plan.” We are asking all unit heads to familiarize their teams with their unit’s plan.
    We do not expect to cancel classes or close the University. Please note that essential support functions will continue and staff may be directed to work from home.

Communication and Update

We expect the situation to change on a daily basis.  While we are prepared to send emails and alerts as and when necessary, please see the University of Houston COVID-19 webpage for the latest updates and actions. You may access this page from the home page. You may direct your questions to your supervisor and, if necessary, you may also direct them to coronavirus@uh.edu.  A list of useful questions and answers will be posted on the page as well.

Community responsibility

Finally, Dr. Vanessa Tilney, the university’s executive director of the Student Health Center, has been designated as the university’s health liaison.  Dr. Tilney and the team continue to be constantly in touch with local, state and federal experts.  We are working with cities and counties wherever our campuses are located, with the Texas Medical Center, state authorities, and the CDC.

You should act responsibly as a community member if you are sick.  If you have a cough, fever, shortness of breath or other symptoms of contagious illness, you should seek medical attention to ensure it is safe for you to be on campus.

Houston,10-Mar-2020,"Dear Department Chairs and Associate Deans for Research:

We are aware our researchers need access to laboratories should we have to work remotely. With that in mind, please review and share the guidance below concerning access to laboratories with your faculty members and principal investigators.
 

    For those individuals who need access to labs because of ongoing research activities (i.e. faculty, students, technical and research staff), they should be listed as essential personnel in the department’s Continuity of Operations Plan delineating not only who they are, but also where will they be working. This information should be prepared by the department and be readily available if requested by the Office of the Provost, the Division of Research, UH Police Department, or Emergency Services.
     

    Principal Investigators are required to establish clear written protocols for who should individuals call or contact if there are any health and safety issues that arise when working in the lab with minimal supervision from senior faculty and/or staff.
     

    Principal Investigators are asked to be mindful of the interactions between them, their students, or their research staff to limit physical interactions.
     

    Additional sanitation is mandatory for work-stations, lab bench-tops, communal equipment, and common areas that each individual has been in contact with before and after they visit the lab.
     

    Principal Investigators should cancel all lab meetings and significant gatherings during this time and organize virtual lab meetings through the Microsoft Teams software that all UH employees have access to, or allow faculty to create Blackboard shells for their lab groups as if they were a class. Both platforms have the capability for real-time online virtual meetings, written information sharing, and/or communications.
     

    Principal Investigators are required to consider delaying the start of activities that require lab personnel to congregate (e.g. additional in-person training, tasks that require multiple personnel).
     

    If there are regular recurring  lab activities that require by policy more than one person to perform (e.g. liquid nitrogen tank filling, equipment change outs, etc.), then the Principal Investigators should designate a specific team of the same individuals to perform those recurring tasks during the time there is limited access to the labs.
     

    It is expected that the UH Animal Care Organization will take all the steps above, taking into account the special needs of animal husbandry and other necessary daily operations and maintenance.
     
    Principal Investigators who are currently conducting research involving human subjects should, if appropriate and does not increase risk to subjects, consider postponing data collection activities. The Research Integrity and Oversight (RIO) Office in the Division of Research will be issuing additional guidance to those investigators with active research protocols. For any immediate questions concerning human research projects, please contact the RIO Office (cphs@central.uh.edu).

The UH Health Liaison, Dr. Vanessa Tilney, and the UH Office of Emergency Management work with local, state and federal authorities on a daily basis. We will keep you informed about any updates as they relate to your work and learning at UH.  Meanwhile, we urge you to follow personal hygiene precautions and exercise social distancing measures as recommended by CDC and local health authorities.

I understand that these precautionary measures may be inconvenient and disappointing to you, but we hope these efforts can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our community.  Your health and safety are our priority.

Please find more information about COVID-19 here on the webpage or reach out to our team with questions by using coronavirus@uh.edu.  Further communication for faculty, staff and students will be forthcoming Thursday.

Thank you.

Houston,11-Mar-2020,"Dear UH Student:

As communicated by President Khator yesterday, the University of Houston is taking extraordinary steps to mitigate the possibility of our students, faculty, and staff contracting COVID-19. This is being done while also making every effort to continue instructional activities during the spring semester.

In response to city and county emergency health declarations, we will be transitioning all classes to an online format in an effort to limit large gathering and to practice social distancing. No face-to-face classes will be offered on campus at the University of Houston, UH at Sugar Land, or UH at Katy until at least April 6.

In order to ensure a smooth and efficient transition to online delivery, the University has instituted a one week pause in all instructional activities beginning Monday, March 16, including existing online classes. This will include all tests, exams, and assignments due during the week of Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. During this instructional pause, your faculty instructors will be preparing to deliver all classes remotely beginning Monday, March 23.

If your instructor is currently using either Blackboard or Courseware as part of your current class, they will continue to use them. If not, you will be able to access your class through Blackboard on Monday, March 23. If this is the case, please login to Blackboard to access the online version of your face-to-face class. Faculty instructors have been asked to contact all of their students through Blackboard, Courseware, or email beginning Monday, March 16. It is important that you respond to your instructor so that they are confident that you have remote access to your class.

During the one week pause in all instructional activities from Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21, you are required to take the following actions:

    Login to access your online class (or classes) through either Blackboard or Courseware and respond to your instructor’s messages. If your instructor also contacts you by email please response to that email as well. In either case, you are required to establish contact with your instructor by Wednesday, March 18.

    You will receive a copy of your modified class syllabus from your faculty instructor no later than Friday, March 20, detailing how your class content will be delivered remotely. 

    CASA will be closed Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. A decision will be made at that time regarding CASA’s further operations.

    Classes will resume remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continue online at least until Saturday, April 4.

If you have questions about your courses, please reach out directly to your faculty instructor through Blackboard, Courseware, or via email. I am committed to keeping you regularly updated of any changes to our schedule concerning remote operations, or any broader city or county developments that may impact the health and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.
 
As we navigate through these challenging circumstances together, I assure you that faculty will continue to deliver the highest quality of education regardless of the format. Please continue to monitor your UH email as well as uh.edu. For specific questions about the impact of COVID-19, please reach out to coronavirus@uh.edu.

Houston,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Staff:

Following the recent announcement from President Khator, it’s important to note that the University, including the University of Houston at Katy and the University of Houston at Sugar Land, will remain open, and all offices and services will continue operations at this time.  While this is a very rapidly evolving situation, we currently do not anticipate any change in the services provided at each location or instructional site.  Please know that should there be any changes to our operational status, you will be notified by an official announcement from the University accordingly.

As part of overall ongoing response and business continuity processes and procedures, your health and safety as a valued team member is our utmost priority.  In support, we have taken several actionable steps in this regard, including the following:

Health and Hygiene

    Increased cleaning and sanitation protocols for facilities, including all food service locations and high-volume “touchpoints,” such as commonly used door handles, elevators, vending machine areas, among many others, as well as the deployment of hand sanitizer dispensers, and discontinuing the self-service option at all dining locations.
    We are also rigorously following the “Guidance for Workplaces and Businesses” as outlined by the City of Houston Health Department.  

Temporary Telecommuting Workplace Arrangement Request Process

As a result of this rapidly evolving response, there may be circumstances where a flexible workplace arrangement may be an effective alternative within your team, program office or department if you are able to continue to perform your work functions from a remote location. 

Please know that the approval of a flexible workplace arrangement will be considered by your immediate supervisor and next level leader on an individual basis. As with any temporary arrangement, your immediate supervisor and/or next level leader may discontinue the flexible workplace initiative at any time.  To proceed with the process to request working remotely on a temporary basis, the following University of Houston Telecommuting request form https://uh.edu/human-resources/forms/uhs-telecommuting_form.pdf is required for completion by each employee to be submitted to your immediate supervisor to begin the review and approval process.

Helpful Resources

As these are extremely anxious and uncertain times, it’s important to note that there are additional resources provided by the University, including the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), telemedicine, and elder/child care service options. For more detail on benefits eligibility, please click here: https://uh.edu/human-resources/hr-communications/benefit-services-communication-3.11.2020.pdf

All departments should review and update your Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) and share them with your staff to ensure essential functions can continue if a disruption of service occurs. Plan templates may be found here: https://uh.edu/emergency-management/planning-and-response/business-continuity-plans/.

As we proceed onward, be sure to remain vigilant in practicing thorough handwashing, sanitizing and recommended hygiene best practices. Feel free to download these helpful “Cover Toss Clean” tips as well. Additional information regarding prevention and precautions can found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.

Staying Informed

It is especially critical that each of us remains updated on this rapidly evolving global situation. For the latest information, visit the University COVID-19 updates website. In addition, be sure to update your contact information in P.A.S.S. via Access UH. 

Lastly, should you have any questions about the University COVID-19 (coronavirus) updates, please submit them to coronavirus@uh.edu.

As our business is service excellence, I offer my heartfelt thanks and deep appreciation for all that you do on a daily basis to continue your outstanding support in these coming days.

Houston,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

Since my last communication regarding the university’s response to COVID-19, President Trump as well as state and local officials have announced additional efforts to slow its spread, or “flatten the curve.""

Following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and federal, state and local health officials, my leadership team has been working to adjust operations with regard to the health, wellbeing and safety of our UH community.   I encourage you to consult our website regularly.

The University of Houston is open for operation and services. No classes are being held this week and all of the instruction and most of the operations will be conducted remotely from March 23 until at least April 4.   To comply with guidelines issued by the City of Houston, all retail and dining establishments on campus will convert to takeout orders only, effective immediately. Social distancing procedures are being introduced in residence halls, libraries, workspaces and student spaces.  A decision with regard to commencement will be made next week.

The purpose of this communication is to put things in perspective and offer you additional guidelines as it comes to your day-to-day decision-making.

In the coming weeks, our goals are:

    To continue our educational mission by offering instruction and support services to students.
    To keep university functions and services operational.
    To attend to resident students still living in university housing.
    To attend to the needs of those students most in need, whether financial, academic, mental, physical or otherwise.
    To keep the research labs operational and productive.
    To keep all facilities fully sanitized and clean by following the protocols of the CDC.

To this effect here are some important things you should know:

    Faculty and staff may work from home to the extent they are able to perform job functions remotely and with appropriate approval from their supervisors. More clarity will be forthcoming from Human Resources to answer questions that you might have.
    The University is open for those who need to physically come in and for those who are asked to come in due to the nature of their work. Please continue to take the preventive actions as recommended by the CDC.
    With guidance from the CDC and local officials, we discourage events with groups of 10+.
    We are committed to protecting your salary and benefits irrespective of your job category to the fullest extent possible based on state requirements.  We want you to take care of yourself and your family and to do your part in the controlling the outbreak.  We also want to find ways for you to balance your personal and professional lives.
    Many people may have questions about COVID-19 or begin to experience a variety of heightened emotions during this period of uncertainty.  Please know that UH has resources available that can provide support for you including the following:
        Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers a dynamic array of services intended to meet your needs where you are.  The phone number is 713.743.5454.
        Current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students can connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat using Telehealth.
        Employees can visit the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to find self-help tools and learn more about the resources available.  Employees can also call to schedule a free, confidential appointment with one of their many skilled professionals
    We have reestablished our Cougars Care SharePoint sites for faculty and staff to help one another with resources or support during these next few weeks.  You can locate this service on AccessUH.  

My team and I are committed to the fair treatment of all involved and are seeking flexibility and guidance from the state. We are also in constant touch with other university systems and conferring about best practices.

This is uncharted territory, and these goals cannot be accomplished without your help, dedication and creativity. I know you care about your work, our common mission, and most of all our students. In the city of Houston and in the Cougar Nation, we rise to the occasion when called upon.

Thank you for your dedication and commitment. Follow health protocols and stay healthy.

With warm regards,

Houston,12-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Thank you so much for working so diligently to face the crisis and for the solutions you’ve provided no matter what the challenge. I am proud and grateful to be with you. Most of you are working from home but some of you are on campus keeping the essential services going and/or leading the troops.  My team and I thank you all, but particularly those who are on campus.

I wanted to let you know that after careful consideration and consultation, we have made the following three decisions. You can refer to my letter to students for more details.

    All classes will be offered remotely for the rest of the Spring Semester.
     
    Graduation ceremonies have been postponed until late summer/early fall.
     
    In the context of the current  breakdown of our economy and the long road ahead, the Board of Regents has asked us to not take any new financial obligations because they (and we, too) are witnessing layoffs and pay cuts in almost all businesses around us.  To comply with this directive and to be committed to the people already on the payroll, I have asked vice presidents to put a 30-day pause on signing off on any kind of new financial obligation including hires, contracts, procurement, etc.

During this time, we can come together and work out different scenarios and see what our best options are. This is not a hiring freeze but a 30-day pause to carefully formulate our strategy through the process of shared governance. Your guidance through deans/directors or Faculty Senate/Staff Council will be extremely important.

Thank you again for your dedication, commitment and engagement.

With warm regards,
Renu Khator",289,tex,3
Houston,17-Mar-2020,"Dear Students --

During this very difficult situation, we have been listening intently to you and your families.  Preserving health and safety has been first and foremost in every step we have taken and every decision we’ve made.  In the final analysis,  our students and UH community are who matter most to us. With that in mind, the following decisions have been made:

ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, STUDENT LIFE, AND EVENTS

    Spring 2020 courses will be offered remotely (online or alternative format) beginning March 23 and for the duration of the semester. We are currently working through details on online test proctoring, labs and other considerations. I am asking faculty members, deans and university leaders to work to accommodate student needs throughout these difficult times.  Computer labs are open for those who need them and resources for off-campus Wi-Fi are available from UIT. 
     
    Spring 2020 Commencement will be postponed. Canceling graduation would be detrimental to all of the hard work our students have done to earn their degrees. We will begin planning for a late summer or early fall commencement as soon as public health conditions and operational guidelines allow.  Delaying the graduation/commencement ceremonies will not delay the actual conferring of degrees to May graduates. The latest updates, including new information about cap and gown orders, and rescheduled dates can be found here as the information becomes available.
     
    Events sponsored by the University are canceled, no matter the size, through the end of April.  Rather than continuing to provide updates based on the latest federal, state or local size limitations, we prefer to provide clear guidance for the near term.  These restrictions include conferences, symposia, and social gatherings.  This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.

STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

    Residential housing will remain open for those who choose to stay or return and complete your course work remotely for the remainder of the semester.  If you plan to move out of housing and not continue in housing through the remainder of the semester, please follow the process that Student Housing & Residential Life will outline for you soon.  You will receive further information about the refund/credit of your unused amount for these services in addition to parking.  We will work with you on any specific needs, and we thank you for your patience.
     
    All dining establishments operating on campus, retail and residential, have converted to takeout orders only to comply with guidelines issued by the city of Houston and to promote social distancing.  More information on unused balances on dining plans will be communicated in the next week.  For more information on hours and locations, please visit dining services.

    Cougar Cupboard  in partnership with the Houston Food Bank is open and available for students who require access to additional food.
     
    M. D. Anderson Library will remain open with computer labs available to those in need and online material available for access. Beginning March 23, access to the library will be limited to UH students, faculty and staff.
     
    UH Cougars Care community SharePoint is available to allow peer-to-peer support and help for faculty, staff and students.  Visit AccessUH to begin your conversations.
     
    The Student Health Center will continue to be available for non-emergency, outpatient medical care to currently enrolled UH students.  Appointments may be scheduled by calling 713-743-5151 during regular business hours.
     
    UH Counseling and Psychological Services is waiving session fees and/or no show and late cancel charges for all appointment types. CAPS remains open and will assess for the most appropriate treatment option which may include referrals/resources, crisis services, phone sessions, or an in-person appointment.
     
    Telehealth is available for current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students to connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat.
     
    The Campus Recreation and Wellness Center is temporarily suspending in-person workouts in the facility through April 4, but it is providing opportunities for remote workouts.
     
    The Student Center is open, but closing each night at 10 p.m. until further notice.
     
    Please refer to our university COVID-19 website for the latest updates and resources.

We are in the midst of an extraordinary challenge, and the situation continues to change rapidly.  But there is one thing that will not change – this University’s commitment to do what is best for our students.  We will work through this together, remaining safe and continuing our educational mission. I know we can do this.

Houston,19-Mar-2020,"To the Campus Community: 

I want to call your attention to important updates regarding COVID-19.

In order to safeguard the health and safety of our university community, any faculty, staff or student returning from any international travel or having close contact with anyone who has been confirmed to have COVID-19 will need to self-quarantine for 14-days and receive approval before returning to work/campus.

If you have not registered your international travel to any location outside the United States, you must do so before returning to campus.

Due to the increase in the number of cases related to community spread, we are implementing two new reporting requirements.  First, faculty, staff and students who have reason to believe that they have been exposed to an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19 must report that information to the university.  Second, faculty, staff and students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must report that diagnosis to the university.

Those required forms are on the university’s COVID-19 website: https://uh.edu/covid-19/

We realize many people may still have questions about COVID-19 or have begun to experience a variety of heightened emotions during this period of uncertainty.  Please know that UH has resources available that can provide support for you including the following:

    Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers an array of services intended to meet your needs where you are.  The phone number is 713.743.5454.
    Current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students can connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat using Telehealth
    Employees can visit the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to find self-help tools and learn more about the resources available.  Employees can also call to schedule a free, confidential appointment with one of their many skilled professionals.

Please keep your community responsibility in mind.  Actions everyone can take to mitigate the spread of infection include everyday preventive measures, like good handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue and staying home when you are sick. The CDC provides helpful information about these “nonpharmaceutical interventions”.  Employees will be sent home if they come to campus with symptoms of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.

We are a campus community that is rising to meet the challenge, adapting to different learning and working configurations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We shall remain a caring and cohesive community of resilient Coogs.

Houston,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

Much has happened in our country since my last communication and we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. Cities and states are taking further measures to limit human contact and slow the spread of COVID-19.  

Today, Harris County issued a Stay at Home order beginning at 11:59pm tonight through April 3. What does this mean for us?

Similar to universities in other cities and states which are under Stay-at-Home order, the University of Houston is expected to continue its operations remotely. As a state public university, we also continue to seek guidance from state authorities and work with other state universities on how to safely fulfill our mission and continue to operate. With this in mind, please note the following:

    University of Houston will continue delivering instruction remotely, the process we began on Monday.  Faculty have transitioned thousands of courses online and will be flexible. Staff have been innovative in using new and creative ways to support students.  And students have been diligent in shifting to the online platform. Together, we will make it work.

    A pass-fail option for this semester is currently under consideration by the appropriate faculty bodies. Any decision and details implementing it will be communicated before the end of the week.

    Student Housing & Residential Life remain open until the end of the spring semester, however we are encouraging students who can go home safely, to go home until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted. Additionally, students who have already planned to move out may still move out today. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.

    All UH locations will expand their social distancing efforts by reformatting programs and support services. It will involve less direct contact and more remote support. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.

This is an extraordinary time. Our own university community has confirmed two positive cases of COVID-19. In both cases, individuals had not been on campus and any person who may have been in contact with them has been notified.

Continue to check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information. Please take precaution and preventive measures whether you are 18 or 81.  We are one connected piece of society’s make-up and only we can help control the spread in our community.

Thank you for being a resilient Cougar.  We are all in it together and we will all pull through this together.

Houston,19-Mar-2020,"Dear Undergraduate Students:

In response to the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and upon recommendation by the Faculty Senate Undergraduate Committee, the University of Houston is implementing an Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy.

This policy provides students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis and applies to all undergraduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session.

The deadline for students to choose their grading option is 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.  Details regarding the process through which students make this choice will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar by April 27, 2020.

The University of Houston is taking these steps to help you be successful during our current extraordinary circumstances. Together, we will prevail and overcome all the challenges we face.

Houston,24-Mar-2020,"Dear Graduate and Professional Students:

The University of Houston wants you to continue to be successful in your courses this semester despite the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the University is implementing an interim policy for graduate grades that will benefit you and help mitigate these extraordinary circumstances we are facing.

The policy provides most graduate students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis. Should you choose this option, it means that if your course's current grading scheme is Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grades of Satisfactory will remain the same, and grades of Unsatisfactory will convert to No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR). 

If your course's current grading scheme is letter grade, then students with a grade of C- or higher may choose to receive the Satisfactory (S) grade instead of the letter grade. For grades below C-, students may choose to receive the No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) option instead of the letter grade. 

I encourage you to read fully the policy online, but here are several key highlights:

    The Interim Graduate Grade Policy applies to all graduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session. The policy will be reviewed for continuation through future terms if necessary. Professional students should check the full policy to determine eligibility and should contact their program with questions.

    You will have the opportunity to review your spring semester grades and then choose your grading option for the semester as the deadline for you to choose is not until 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.

    More details regarding the process through which you will choose your grading options will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar near the end of the semester.

    Satisfactory (S) and No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) grades are not factored into term or cumulative GPA.

To assist graduate students who are graduating this semester and are working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission of your thesis/dissertation has been extended to May 22, 2020.  Please check with your college regarding the college submission deadlines.

While we have structured this new policy to benefit you, I strongly recommend you contact your academic advisor to discuss questions regarding the impact of your grade option choice on academic matters. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid should also be consulted to discuss the impact of your grade option choice on financial aid matters.

The University believes in you and your academic pursuits, and we have made these changes to help you overcome the challenges we face. After reading the policy, should you have questions, please reach out to grading@uh.edu.

Houston,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Undergraduate Students:

As Provost, I recognize the extraordinary challenges faced by students as they work to successfully complete their courses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I appreciate your thoughtful questions following yesterday’s announcement of the Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy. The policy was designed specifically to provide you with the flexibility to choose a course-by-course no-risk alternative grading option to meet your needs and goals.

To help you better understand the policy, I am including the following graphic and key points.

Important Policy Highlights

    The Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy applies to all undergraduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6, as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session. The policy will be reviewed for continuation through future terms if necessary.

    You will have the opportunity to review your spring semester grades and then choose your grading option

    You may make different grade choices for different classes, choosing to keep some letter grades, to receive a grade of Satisfactory (S) for letter grades D- or above, and to receive No Credit Reported (NCR) for grades of F.

    Any letter grades you choose to keep will be used to calculate your GPA; Satisfactory (S) and No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) grades are not factored into term or cumulative GPA.

    The deadline for instructors to post grades is May 11, 2020, and then you will have until 5:00 pm on May 18, 2020, to select the grading option you prefer for each class.

    The process through which you will choose your grading options is being designed now, and more details will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar by April 27, 2020.

Houston,26-Mar-2020,"Dear Research Faculty,

We are actively monitoring the local and global health situation around the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. We intend to keep research and research support services functioning as normally as possible, including labs, core facilities and service centers. Funding agencies have not issued any notice affecting proposal submission, awards issuance or other impactful changes to sponsored research activities as it relates to COVID-19. 

We understand you may be concerned about possible disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements and want to share current guidance and assure you of our support as the situation develops. 

Research-related travel:

    The University is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.
    Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please evaluate your options carefully.
    Canceling your travel:
        If you have already made and paid for travel arrangements on grant funds, please work with your department’s business staff to request refunds to be credited back to the award. If a refund is not possible and the expenses will remain on the award, you must provide supplemental documentation outlining the refund denial to support the charges.
        To date, there is no federal guidance related to charges of cancelled non-refundable travel expenses due to the coronavirus. We will continue to follow the University’s travel expense policy and the Uniform Guidance.  The University’s Travel Information page has been updated to address costs of canceled travel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and concerns. 

Funding research staff and students on grants:

    Working Remotely  In the event the University of Houston closes/cancels operations due to COVID-19, research staff and students supported on grant funds can be paid provided they remain engaged and continue to work on the project remotely.
    If working remotely is not an option, due to the nature of work on the project, the award should not be charged salary. Faculty wishing to retain such staff should work with their Chair and Dean to bridge fund such positions. In the event there is a need to terminate employment you must follow university written policy, which usually requires a 30-day written notice to the employee. If the researcher is unable to continue to work on the project, and is key personnel with committed effort, NIH and NSF policy require notifying the program officer regarding disengagement and effort reductions.
    Absence Due to Illness  If a researcher is absent from work due to illness their salary can continue to be paid from the award in accordance with MAPP 02.02.03 Leaves of Absence.

Delays:

    Program managers must be informed, in writing, of any delay in the project scope of work caused by disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements. If the delay will result in a late progress report, this information must be conveyed before the report becomes due.
    Most federal agencies, including NIH and NSF, do not grant approval for late submissions. Agencies do have policies that address extenuating circumstances. If you have a specific situation that can be considered an extenuating circumstance, please contact the agency Program Official and your UH preaward contact for guidance.

Research awards with human subjects protocols:

    The IRB, through the Office of Research Integrity and Oversight, has provided additional guidance for human subjects research. The information can be found on the Division of Research website under COVID-19 Information and Resources.

In response to the City of Houston and Harris County emergency health declarations, and to do our part in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the University of Houston will immediately cease all face-to-face instructional activities (i.e. lectures, seminars, discussions or presentations) and deliver all of our classes remotely using online and/or virtual learning platforms, at least until April 4. 

In order to ensure a smooth transition to online delivery, we have instituted a one week pause in all instructional activities beginning Monday, March 16, including existing online classes. During that week, we must ensure that our students are aware of the implications of this transition and prepared to take classes remotely beginning Monday, March 23.

Monday, March 16 – Saturday, March 21
We ask that you do the following during this week: 

    Monday, March 16 – Please initiate regular communication with your students through Blackboard or Courseware class shell and via email. Inform your students that there will be a one week pause in all class activities, including all tests, exams, and assignments due during the week of Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. CASA will also be closed March 16 – March 21. A decision will be made at that time regarding CASA’s further operations.

 

    Tuesday, March 17 - Saturday, March 21 – Modify your class curriculum to reflect how you will deliver the remainder of your class content using either asynchronous instruction (i.e. online presentations, discussion boards, reading assignments, etc.) or synchronous instruction (i.e. virtual face-to-face sessions using Blackboard Collaborate, Microsoft Teams, etc.). Ensure that any additional online tools to deliver your class content are enabled and that instructions for their use by students are available within your Blackboard or Courseware class shell. Students must be informed of these curricular changes by posting of your updated curriculum to your class shell no later than noon on Friday, March 20.  

Additional information and resources for faculty instructors, including registration details for upcoming online help sessions, quick tutorials, and additional resources for Blackboard and other tools can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis.

Monday, March 23 - Saturday, April 4
All classes previously taught face-to-face will resume online through Blackboard or Courseware. Students will not be on campus for instruction. Information and additional resources for faculty instructors using Blackboard and other related online tools will remain available throughout the period of remote operations, and can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis.


Additional Considerations

With department chair approval, faculty members who are most vulnerable or at high risk of contracting COVID-19 will be allowed to continue providing instruction online through the end of the spring semester.

Guidance on how faculty members can gain access to research laboratories can be found here. Please contact the Division of Research if any you have any additional questions concerning research operations.   

I am committed to keeping you regularly updated of any changes to our schedule concerning remote operations, or any broader city or county developments that may impact the health and well-being of our faculty, students, and staff.  As we work through these extraordinary circumstances, I know you will work to deliver a high quality education to our students regardless of the format. I deeply appreciate your willingness to work with me as we navigate this situation together.

Dear Cougar Families,

I hope this communication finds your families safe and healthy.

Due to COVID-19 we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. I want you to know that the University of Houston is dedicated to the academic success of our students, as well as to their physical and mental wellbeing.

The University continues to move quickly as events unfold during these uncertain times. This includes actions taken to comply with the Stay Home, Work Safe order issued by Harris County, which includes Houston, on Tuesday, March 24, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. This order is in place through April 3. Measures the University has already taken allow us to easily comply with this order and protect the safety of faculty, staff and students.

A comprehensive list of changes the University has implemented can be found on UH’s COVID-19 website. I encourage you to consult this website regularly for the latest updates. Here, I want to share with you some of these decisions made by University leadership.

Here are some important updates:

    As remote online instruction continues, all UH campuses will expand social distancing efforts by reducing or modifying programs and support services. On-campus functions will be limited to supporting essential services;
    The M.D. Anderson Library will be closed effective March 25 and until further notice, including computer labs. Students in need of computer access should consult the UH Remote Learning website for resources available;
    Student Housing & Residential Life expects to remain open until the end of the Spring semester; however, we are encouraging students who can go home safely to do so until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted;
    An interim Undergraduate Grade Policy has been enacted, which will allow undergraduates to choose a letter grade that counts toward their GPA if they received a D- or above, or choose an “S” satisfactory if they passed the class, or take an “NCR” no credit recorded if they did not pass the class. The “S” and “NCR” will not impact their GPA. Students may make different grade choices for different classes.

The Division of Student Affairs and Enrollment Services will continue to serve students remotely, via phone, email or online chats. Many services now offer virtual options, including live chats for career counseling, teletherapy sessions from Counseling and Psychological Services, telehealth from the Student Health Center and online workouts from Campus Recreation.

We have posted a summary of how to access services on our website.

Although this is a challenging time, I am confident that the Cougar Nation will persevere. The University of Houston’s faculty and staff remain committed to ensuring student success despite the circumstances.

Please take care of yourself and your families.

Sincerely,
Richard Walker, Ed.D.

Houston,3-Apr-2020,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

I hope you and your families are safe and well, and secluded like I have been. As a sign of the times, my family came together virtually to celebrate our granddaughter’s 7th birthday. We didn’t get any cake, but we’re doing our part to keep this virus from spreading and not contribute to the dangerous workload of our heroic healthcare workers.

Looking forward to the summer, not even our most knowledgeable health experts can predict with certainty when the threat of COVID-19 will subside. But we do know it will be with us for some time and so will the need for social distancing. That is why my leadership team and I have made the decision to continue delivering remote instruction for all four summer sessions, which begin June 1, and the May mini-session.

Even with classes online, we still have about 1,600 students living in on-campus housing and dedicated staff who are preparing food, cleaning and sanitizing our buildings for those who must access their office or lab, and police and security officers on their regular patrols. Even though we are enforcing social distancing and following all guidance from health officials, it is not lost on me the anxiety that is felt by those people whose presence at the workplace is essential to support delivery of education. I truly appreciate you all.

Finally, I want to recognize our faculty who have adjusted to holding class online and our researchers who are testing potential drugs to fight COVID-19 and applying technology to protect health care workers on the frontlines. Where we can, the University of Houston is also providing much-needed resources to people on the frontline in the greater Houston area.

It’s a reminder that treating patients and stopping the spread of COVID-19 indeed takes all of us. Together we will get through this.

With warm regards,
Renu Khator",314,tex,4
Houston,6-Apr-2020,"Dear Faculty: 

First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. These are unprecedented times and the many professional and personal challenges we all currently face are trying and difficult. In the midst of the truly universal impact of COVID-19 on our campus community, our nation, and the world, I am deeply impressed with how each of you has faced the many challenges of rapidly transitioning to online teaching while showing an extraordinary level of commitment to your students. In one week, you transitioned over 6,500 course sections to an online format while simultaneously learning to use a range of new tools and processes. Each day brings new challenges, and each day you continue to rise to meet them. I am grateful for your tenacity and resilience, without which I know it would be impossible to continue our primary mission: educating our students. 

The current circumstances have required us all to make many changes in the way we work, teach, and advance our research. Thus, I want to ensure that the Office of the Provost continues to provide the help and support you need as a faculty member to remain up-to-date on policy changes and new opportunities for assistance and resources. Going forward, I will be sending regular newsletters to you that include information on topics in which the faculty has expressed an interest, including web links to policy updates and FAQs, specific dates and times for virtual office hours with my senior staff, and announcements of online opportunities for self-care through the FED and the ADVANCE Center. 

Over the past two weeks, through our shared governance process, and in close collaboration with the Faculty Senate, we have implemented a range of policy changes to lessen the frustration and concern of both our students and our faculty in these challenging times. In this newsletter, I want to focus on those policy changes and announce dates and times for virtual office hours to afford you the opportunity to have your specific questions addressed personally.

Undergraduate Students 

As our students may be facing a number of challenges associated with our transition to online classes, it is critically important that we identify and engage with those students who have not yet responded, or otherwise made contact, since we began our remote instruction on March 23. With that in mind, you will be receiving a follow-up email with instructions on how to respond to a Navigate Progress Report Campaign toward the goal of successful course completion. 

We have instituted an interim grade policy for undergraduate students. The graphic below was shared with undergraduate students following the announcement of the change to help them make the best academic decision at the end of the semester.

Graduate and Professional Students 

A similar interim grade policy is in effect for graduate and professional students. In addition, to assist students who are graduating this semester and are currently working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission has been extended to May 22, 2020.

On March 18, deans and department chairs received an email providing initial guidance concerning the process for requesting an extension of the probationary period due to the current situation. Guidelines on extension of the probationary period due the impact of COVID-19 will apply to both tenure track (TT) and promotion-eligible non tenure track (NTT) faculty members. 

Faculty members may request an extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure under existing provisions in the current P&T and NTT policies for “Extension of the Probationary Period for Emergencies.” Extension requests related to the negative impact of COVID-19 on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure may be made by a faculty member at any time during their probationary period up until March 1 of the year in which the mandatory review is scheduled. For those faculty members currently scheduled for mandatory review beginning in fall 2020, the March 1, 2020 deadline for the Provost to review such requests has been extended until May 31, 2020.
Current policy allows up to two, one-year extensions of the probationary period for birth or adoption of a child. Faculty members who have already received two previous extensions for birth or adoption of a child may request an additional extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progress toward promotion and/or tenure.

Forthcoming annual updates to the P&T and NTT policies for the 2020-2021 review cycle will be issued by May 1 and explicitly reflect the above accommodations. 

Student Course Evaluation Committee 

I have appointed a committee charged with developing an interim policy on student course evaluations. Faculty Senate President Jeronimo Cortina is serving as the chair. The committee is developing an interim policy which acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on faculty instruction and educational practice. It will provide recommendations to me on the most appropriate role student course evaluations should play in assessing student learning and faculty instructional effectiveness during the disruption caused by COVID-19. The interim policy will be implemented within the next two weeks and will apply to all classes taught during the spring and summer 2020 semesters.

The current membership of the committee is: Dr. Vallabh Das (Faculty Senate President-Elect), Dr. Susie Gronseth (Faculty Senate Secretary, EDU), Dr. Jason Draper (Faculty Affairs Committee, HRM), Dr. David Shattuck (Undergraduate Committee, ENG), Dr. Rheeda Walker (CLASS/PSYCH), and Ms. Nia Soherta (MEC, Office of the Provost).

Below are several dates for Virtual Office Hours to answer any specific questions you may have on the topics covered in this email. A link to join these virtual sessions can be found on the Office of the Provost COVID-19 Resource webpage. 

    Requesting an Extension to Probationary Period: April 9, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m. (TEAMS), and April 10, 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. (ZOOM) 
    Interim Student Course Evaluation Policy: April 9, 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. (ZOOM), and April 10, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m. (TEAMS)
    Interim Undergraduate Student Grade Policy: April 9, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. (TEAMS), and April 10, 11 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. (ZOOM)
    Interim Graduate and Professional Student Grade Policy: April 9, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. (ZOOM), and April 10, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m. (TEAMS)

Most importantly, I want to be certain that you continue to access all the resources our University offers to ensure your emotional and physical well-being during this crisis. Our commitment to the University of Houston to enhance human knowledge, to discover new solutions to our world’s challenges, to be relevant to our city and our communities, and to ensure the success of our students, will outlast our current situation.

Thank you for your continued patience and leadership. Please reach out to me at provost@uh.edu for additional support, questions, or suggestions. Please continue to stay safe and healthy.

Houston,13-Apr-2020,"Dear Students: 

Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we have all experienced an extraordinary, sudden shift in how our university delivers and receives academic instruction. This was not easy for anyone involved, but necessary for the University of Houston to fulfill our responsibility to deliver a Tier One education, regardless of the circumstances.

Recognizing that all of you are juggling this change with uncertainty in your personal lives, the University is providing assistance to help overcome short-term resource and financial obstacles and ensure you can continue your studies.

Summer School Changes
Registration for summer school is now open and I encourage you to consider enrolling in one or more of the classes being offered online. The University is making additional changes that benefit you:

    The interim grading policies for both undergraduate and graduate students have been extended to include all summer 2020 sessions.

Additionally, the University is waiving fees for the summer sessions as follows:

    For students taking six credit hours or more during summer 2020, all mandatory fees will be waived;
    For students taking less than six credit hours during summer 2020, all mandatory fees except extended access fees will be waived.

Computer Loaner Program
If you have not been able to access your course materials because you do not have a computer to use while you are learning remotely, we have a limited number of computers available to check out to complete coursework for the duration of the spring semester. The University began reaching out to students last week who have not accessed course materials, starting with seniors. Students who need access to a loaner or who need other assistance with technological needs related to their classes may contact the UH IT Help Desk at 713.743.1411 (call or text), or email support@uh.edu.

There is no question these are stressful times for everyone. No matter the challenges we are all facing, our priorities are to ensure your health and wellbeing and that your education continues without interruption. I urge you to consult the University’s COVID-19 website for additional resources, including access to Counseling and Psychological Services and answers to many frequently asked questions.

Houston,17-Apr-2020,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

We are deeply thankful and proud of the way each of you has responded to our rapid shift in operations, while juggling your own personal challenges, to meet our vital mission of teaching, research and service. These are far from normal times, and your dedication is nothing short of amazing.

The short-term and long-term financial prognoses for the economy – and specifically higher education – are challenging due to the events surrounding COVID-19.  We are now experiencing declines in many essential sources of revenue, which is coupled with an increased need for student financial aid and uncertainty about future enrollment.

While the University has taken a number of steps to immediately reduce expenses and prepare for future financial uncertainty, we must also keep in mind our fiscal responsibilities. Thus the current 30-day pause on new financial obligations, scheduled to expire on April 19, will be extended to Aug. 31, the end of our fiscal year, or until further notice.

Specifically, this includes the following guidelines:
Human Resources

HR activities including the hiring, promotion, reclassification, or position funding changes – and all salary adjustments using central and auxiliary funds, or more specifically state, tuition, course fees, indirect costs, campus auxiliary fees, student service fees, athletics and other local revenue – are suspended.  Transactions including any combination of centrally allocated funds and other non-centrally allocated funds are not exempt from this suspension.  

Exceptions will exist on all funds on a case-by-case basis to facilitate the hiring of faculty reappointments, including adjunct faculty and graduate students who will continue to teach classes already scheduled for the summer.  Similarly, activities on positions using gift funds, federal grants, research grants or sponsored projects may continue.
Procurement

To help us conserve our current financial resources and slow the rate of spending through the end of the fiscal year, all contracts, procurements, and purchases by any method, including procurement cards and travel cards that utilize central funding and auxiliary sources, are suspended.

Exceptions to these guidelines for Human Resources activities and Procurement will continue to require approval of the Division VP, the Provost, and the SVP for Administration and Finance.

We recognize these guidelines are difficult and will touch every aspect of the University, including academics, administration, operations and support services, and athletics, but we strongly believe the continuation of these actions is a prudent move given the fiscal uncertainty of our situation.  We appreciate your continued understanding and support. 

Regards,

Houston,24-Apr-2020,"Faculty and Staff –

Effective Monday, April 27 until further notice, the University of Houston is now requiring face masks for those faculty and staff working on-campus in situations where they are in close proximity (within 6 feet) of others. This requirement is also directed to all who are visiting campus, including students, contractors and visitors (10 years of age or older).   This measure is being taken in light of recent recommendations from the CDC, the federal government and Harris County regarding wearing face coverings.

Please note that face coverings do not need to be worn in the following circumstances:

    When working alone in a single office
    When engaging in physical activity outside
    When doing so poses a greater mental or physical health, safety or security risk
    While operating outdoor equipment if not appropriate from a safety standpoint
    When consuming food or drink

Individuals are asked to wear a face covering (examples include bandana, scarf, handkerchief or other homemade mask) that covers their nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings should be washed daily. The use of surgical masks, surgical N-95 respirators of other medical masks is strongly discouraged to maintain the resources for health care providers and first responders. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing and regular handwashing. Continue to keep a distance of at least 6 feet between yourself and others.

Resources for Making Your Own Face Covering

    CDC guidelines including how to make a simple face covering: Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19.

Houston,4-May-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. We have come to the end of this very unusual spring semester. Thanks to your efforts, which included transitioning thousands of classes and services online, more than 6,000 students will graduate next week.  Congratulations … to all of us!

Here are some important updates for you.

Reopening the University: Earlier this week, Gov. Abbott announced a plan to safely reopen Texas.  I had already appointed a UH System Reopening Task Force under the co-chairmanship of Vice Chancellor Amr Elnashai and UHV President Robert Glenn.  The task force approved seven guiding principles and nine questions to be answered before reopening the system universities. In consultation with the task force, we are reopening the University in four phases: (1) research operations (2) low-touch, low-risk administrative operations (3) all operations and athletics, and finally (4) classroom instruction.

On Tuesday, May 5, research labs at UH can be opened by those researchers who wish to do so. This is voluntary, not mandatory.  Certain administrative services necessary to assist the researchers will also open. The Division of Research will soon send out an email with details.

A few measures have been taken to ensure a safe working environment as we reopen that include:

    Anyone working in a lab will be required to complete a training module, pass a self-health screening test and is expected to cooperate with contact tracing. The training and screening can be found on AccessUH beginning Friday, May 1.
    All CDC and state rules of social distancing will be followed, including the use of face masks if anyone is working in close proximity of others (within 6 feet).
    UH Facilities will adhere to strict rules to clean and disinfect common spaces and arrangements must be made to clean and disinfect lab areas per CDC guidelines.
    Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 or suffering from any respiratory illness will not be allowed in labs.
    Lab personnel will follow proper UH protocol if a positive COVID-19 case is identified in a lab.   

We are closely monitoring public health conditions in the state and the city and will provide further instructions for the next phase based on future developments. Until then, all faculty and staff –with the exception of those who choose to open their labs or are classified as essential support personnel – will continue to work from home.

Summer semester: All summer sessions will be taught online. In view of financial difficulties faced by students, the Board of Regents  has waived some fees for summer enrollees, saving many more than $300 per student. At this point, our summer enrollment looks very strong and we hope to continue the trend.

Fall semester: We expect to resume face-to-face instruction in the fall.  However, we are making plans for three scenarios: fully online, fully on campus, and some form of hybrid. Depending on the public health conditions in the city, we will make that determination sometime in late May or early June.

Commencement: Knowing that our students want to walk across the stage, we have postponed May’s commencement exercise until fall. However, several colleges are hosting virtual memory-sharing events, and we will also do something symbolic to recognize this very important milestone in our graduates’ life.

Emergency aid to students: The CARES ACT included $18 million in direct emergency aid to UH students.  From these funds, we are able to provide support to more than 26,000 students. While we are grateful for these funds, we know that the need is far greater than the allotted funds.  The Cougar Emergency Fund, which is supported by donations, will offer additional assistance to students in need. Finding another way to help, our IT department secured 300 loaner computers for students who were without that vital educational tool.

University Budget: Our fiscal year ends at the end of August, so it is difficult to predict the exact loss of revenue for the University.  The final number will depend upon three factors: state budget reduction, summer and fall enrollment, and available federal or state stimulus funds. Looking at the impact of COVID 19 on the overall economy and the declining state resources because of the oil crisis, it’s logical to assume that our budget will be stressed. I have appointed a Financial Task Force under the chairmanship of Provost Paula Short and Senior Vice President Jim McShan to review all financial tools at our disposal. We are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best and always keeping the well-being of our Cougar family in mind.

Thank you, once again, for your dedicated service.  If you have any questions, you can direct them to the chairs of the Financial Task Force or send them to COVID-19 email (coronavirus@uh.edu) or check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information.

Please stay safe and healthy!

Miami,27-Jan-2020,"Health Advisory: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

Public health agencies are closely monitoring developments around an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Additional cases have been identified in a growing number of other locations, including the United States, where five cases in travelers from Wuhan have been confirmed in four states (Arizona, California, Illinois, and Washington) as of Jan. 26, 2020.

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the virus among members of the University of Miami community or in the state of Florida, and we do not believe that there is any immediate health risk to our campuses.

Student Health Service and other University partners are closely monitoring the situation and are following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The University is taking precautions to identify cases as early as possible should they occur among members of the University community and continues to work in coordination with the Florida Department of Health and the CDC.

If you have been to Hubei Province, China—or been in contact with someone who has—in the past two weeks and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

The University will notify students, staff, and faculty members if there is any immediate health threat and will share information on the Student Health Service webpage as it becomes available.

As a reminder, all students, staff, and faculty members traveling on a University trip must register their travel information with International SOS before departing.

Flu activity is high in the U.S. and is expected to continue for several weeks. Anyone who has not received a flu vaccine this season should consider getting the vaccine. As always, we encourage any student who has health-related questions to contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu and to refer to the Student Health Service website for any updates. Staff and faculty members should contact their primary care provider with any health care questions.

Frequently asked questions about coronavirus

What is Novel Coronavirus?  

    The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. While the CDC considers this a serious public health concern, the immediate health risk from a coronavirus to the general American public is considered low at this time.

What are the symptoms?  

    Current symptoms reported for patients with 2019-nCoV have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.

How is it transmitted?  

    According to the CDC, the virus likely emerged from an animal source but now seems to be spreading from person to person. It is not yet clear how easily 2019-nCoV spreads from person to person.

How is it prevented and treated?

    Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against 2019-nCoV. The CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:
        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
        Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
        Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
        Stay home when you are sick.
        Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
        Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

What travel guidance has been offered for those traveling to or from China?  

    As of Jan. 27, 2020, the CDC has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice recommending people avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China, including Wuhan. The CDC has also issued a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for the rest of China. The notice advises travelers to other parts of China to protect their health by avoiding contact with sick people, avoiding animals (alive or dead) and animal markets, and washing their hands often.

Miami,31-Jan-2020,"To the University of Miami Community,

We are writing with an update on the University of Miami’s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The University is working closely with Miami-Dade County and the state of Florida to monitor this situation and is following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the virus among members of the University of Miami community or in the state of Florida, and we do not believe that there is any immediate health risk to our campuses.

The University of Miami Health System, UHealth, is following all CDC infection control recommendations to ensure the safety of all patients and staff, as well as to implement appropriate precautions for any patients who may arrive at UHealth facilities meeting the CDC screening criteria for the virus.

The U.S. State Department on Thursday, Jan. 30, heightened its travel advisory for China, urging citizens not to travel there due to the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Out of an abundance of caution, the University of Miami is implementing the following guidelines regarding travel to and from China:

Travel to China:

    Consistent with the State Department advisory, the University is suspending all University-affiliated travel to China, effective immediately.
    All University-affiliated study abroad programs to China for the 2020 spring and summer semesters have been postponed and the Miami Herbert Business School’s March 2020 program in China has been canceled.
    Consistent with both State Department and CDC guidance, the University also recommends that all students, staff, and faculty members avoid all nonessential personal travel to China.


Travel from China:

    Any student who has returned to the United States from China within the past 14 days must contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu.
    Any staff or faculty member, or visiting scholar, who has returned to the United States from China within the past 14 days must contact UHealth Infection Control at 786-427-5018.
    All travelers arriving in the U.S. from China are being screened for symptoms of novel coronavirus at 20 U.S. ports of entry, including Miami International Airport.


As a reminder, all students, staff, and faculty members traveling on a University trip must register their travel information with International SOS before departing.

Flu activity is high in the U.S. and is expected to continue for several weeks. Anyone who has not received a flu vaccine this season should consider getting the vaccine. As always, we encourage any student who has health-related questions to contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu and to refer to the Student Health Service website for any updates. Staff and faculty members should contact their primary care provider with any health care questions.

The University will notify students, staff, and faculty members if there is any immediate health threat to our campuses and will modify guidance as the situation warrants.

Following careful review of guidance from the U.S. Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the University of Miami is implementing new travel guidance for Italy and South Korea, and is maintaining travel restrictions for China.

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the virus among members of the University of Miami community or in the state of Florida, and we do not believe that there is any immediate health risk to our campuses.

Out of an abundance of caution, the University is implementing the following travel guidelines:

Travel to Italy or South Korea:

    The CDC has issued a level 2 travel alert for Italy, citing coronavirus and recommending travelers “practice enhanced precautions,” and a level 3 travel alert for South Korea, recommending that travelers “avoid all nonessential travel” to the country.
    Consistent with these advisories, only essential University-affiliated travel to these countries will be permitted, and travel should be delayed if possible.
    The University also strongly recommends that all students, staff, and faculty members avoid all nonessential personal travel to Italy or South Korea.
    Any member of the University community who travels to Italy or South Korea, whether for University-affiliated or personal travel, is required to self-identify immediately upon return and may be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Students returning from these countries must contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu; staff, faculty members, or visiting scholars returning from these regions must contact UHealth Infection Control at 786-427-5018.

    Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in other parts of mainland China within the previous 14 days will undergo health screening at select ports of entry and up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine.


As a reminder, all students, staff, and faculty members traveling abroad as part of academic programs or University business must receive approval in advance and must register their travel information with International SOS.

Public health advisories and health precautions can change with little notice. Anyone planning international travel should check the status of COVID-19 alerts and precautions at all destinations, including layovers, and continue to do so until their return to the U.S.

Miami,28-Feb-2020,"To the University of Miami Community,

The University of Miami continues to closely monitor the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, and University leaders are planning for a broad range of contingencies. We wanted to share with you important information regarding spring break and University-affiliated travel.

Following careful review of guidance from the U.S. Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and out of an abundance of caution, the University is implementing the following updates to travel restrictions:

    All University-affiliated travel to China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, and Iran is suspended, effective immediately.
    The University strongly recommends that all students, staff, and faculty members avoid all personal travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea.
    Any member of the University community who travels to or from China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea is required to self-identify prior to returning to campus and will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Students returning from these countries must contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu; staff, faculty members, or visiting scholars returning from these regions must contact UHealth Infection Control at 786-427-5018.

In addition to these travel restrictions and previously announced actions, the University is implementing the following measures:

    The University has suspended study abroad programs in Italy. All students enrolled in the Italy program are to return to their home locations in the United States or respective country by March 6, 2020.
    Study abroad programs in China, Japan, and South Korea, scheduled to begin later this semester, also have been suspended.
    The University is communicating directly with students in the impacted study abroad programs and is working with those students to ensure their safe return to the U.S. and to minimize disruption to their academic studies.
    The Study Abroad office continues to work directly with students enrolled in global academic programs. Study abroad students who have questions should email studyabroad@miami.edu.

As a reminder, all members of the University community traveling abroad to countries not restricted above as part of academic programs or University business must receive approval in advance and must register their travel information with International SOS.

Public health advisories and health precautions can change with little notice. Anyone planning international travel should check the status of COVID-19 alerts and precautions at all destinations, including layovers, and continue to do so until their return to the U.S.

Miami,05-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty:

As we prepare for spring break, it is important that we directly address any misinformation about the University’s operational plans regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Apparently there are some unsubstantiated reports that classes will be canceled following spring break or that spring break will be extended. This is simply not true.

At this time, based on the diligent work of the University’s coronavirus taskforces, there are no plans to cancel regularly scheduled classes or to close our campuses. Further, in the absence of any reported COVID-19 cases among the University and South Florida communities, we are taking proactive steps outlined in our recent communications available at news.miami.edu/coronavirus. This site contains the most up-to-date and accurate information for the University community and is the sole source on coronavirus information for students, faculty, and staff. The University’s social media platforms are also making sure everyone is aware of this website. Please make sure faculty, staff, and students are aware of the University’s latest communications and health advisories related to the coronavirus and promote this helpful site.

I ask all of you to be nimble during this quickly-changing event and to be respectful of individual decisions made by students and academic peers as we continue to monitor this situation and to follow CDC guidelines, including their recommendations specific to higher education institutions. While we can’t predict the full scope and reach of the outbreak, spring break provides a window for faculty to consider and prepare for the potential impact the viral outbreak can have on our students and their families:

    Our recent actions to suspend study abroad programs in affected areas and nonessential international university-sponsored travel to those places are both precautionary and prudent measures, with any future actions guided by the best science and policies and in close coordination with government and public health agencies.
    Students are anxious, and we ask that the faculty be sensitive to and respectful of students’ personal health needs and that of their families.
    Faculty members should work with students who miss class because of self-isolation that may be required to ensure they can continue their academic pursuits.
    While there are no plans to close the University, we have been working on academic contingency planning since Hurricane Irma in 2017, and the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ recent presentation to the academic deans is promising and may serve as a model for other schools.
    We are more than halfway through the semester. Use spring break as an opportunity to refresh and recharge.
    Everyone should continue to follow good hygiene and responsible citizenship, which go a long way in controlling the spread of coronavirus.

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus, but we are better served by being informed, taking safeguards, following guidelines, and remaining supportive of our students and colleagues.

The health and safety of students, faculty, and staff remains our highest priority. Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Miami,11-Mar-2020,"To the University of Miami Community,

We are writing to keep you updated on new developments in our response to the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While there remains a high level of uncertainty, it is absolutely clear that we, along with other universities, have a responsibility to institute new mitigation practices. We recognize that these actions may be disruptive, but our actions are guided by the recommendations of leading health officials and by our priority to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our community.

This email contains critical information and updates. Please take time to review it in its entirety.

    Classes will resume as scheduled on all University campuses on Monday, March 16.

    We are curtailing large University events and meetings, at least until March 31.

    This policy does not pertain to classes or in-person academic instruction. (Additional information regarding classes can be found below.)
    Effective Sunday, March 15, through Tuesday, March 31, all campus events or meetings with 50 of more attendees, including external events, are canceled, with the following exceptions:
        University athletics events will follow NCAA, ACC, and State of Florida guidelines. At this time no changes have been made to scheduled athletics events.
        Election polling on campus will continue. The Florida primary is scheduled for March 17.
    Additional information on events occurring after April 1 will be communicated no later than March 25.
    At this time, commencement activities to be held May 7, 8, and 9, will proceed as scheduled. Any changes to that schedule will be announced by April 15.

    We are preparing for the possibility of moving classes online, if necessary.

    At this time, we are in alignment with current public health recommendations, which do not warrant a suspension of on-site learning at our campuses.
    We are working with deans and faculty members to prepare for the possibility of remote and virtual instruction for some (or possibly all) courses. As the spread of the virus is fast-changing, we will update the community with more definitive guidance as needed.
    Faculty should be prepared to test the delivery of course materials via online learning platforms on Wednesday, March 18, and Thursday, March 19.

    We are asking employees on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses (who are not part of the UHealth system) to work from home on Friday, March 13, as part of a practice test for staff to work remotely. While there are no reported cases in Miami-Dade County, the time to prepare is now.

    Every major function of the University has contingency plans in place to ensure business continuity if a modified work schedule needs to be implemented in the future. Accordingly, on Friday, March 13, while students are on spring break, we are initiating a preparedness drill on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses to identify any operational issues that may arise so that potential interruptions can be addressed prior to activating these plans.
    With the exception of Tier One employees who support critical functions that cannot be performed remotely, all employees not part of the UHealth system who are on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses are encouraged to use this Friday, March 13, as a work-from-home day. Coordination of this drill will be handled at the unit level, and supervisors are encouraged to discuss and set clear expectations with their employees.
    This is a work-from-home day, not a stay-at-home day. The purpose for this exercise is to test systems of communication and other vital functions to ensure business continuity and to identify any issues that arise, so all employees must be working and accessible throughout normal working hours.

    We are asking all units and all researchers to update their continuity plans.

    All units, including those engaged in research, are strongly encouraged to review and update continuity plans to minimize the impact to ongoing projects as a result of potential for future changes due to COVID-19. Visit www.miami.edu/UReady for additional guidance.

    All University-related international travel is prohibited. University-related domestic travel must receive prior approval by a supervising dean or vice president.

    All travel, both international and domestic, by any employee who operates in or supports clinical care is prohibited to ensure appropriate staffing levels should situations warrant.
    Any member of the University community who travels to or from China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea, or Spain will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon return.
    Students returning from these countries or areas must contact Student Health Service at studenthealth@miami.edu; staff, faculty members, or visiting scholars returning from these regions must contact UHealth Infection Control at 786-427-5018 prior to coming to campus.
    We also strongly discourage all members of the University community from any personal travel using mass transit (excluding localized mass transit, such as Metrorail or Tri-Rail).
    Travel for University athletics will continue to follow NCAA and ACC guidelines.

    We are restricting guest access to residence halls.

    Effective Monday, March 16, access to University residence halls will be limited to University students, staff, and faculty. Outside guests will not be permitted inside residence halls.
    ’Cane Card access will be required to enter outside doors of the residential colleges at 5 p.m. daily, rather than 10 p.m., beginning on March 16.


On Monday, March 9, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Florida. The designation allows the state to take proactive and effective measures to address the coronavirus outbreak. While there are 14 confirmed cases in Florida, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus among members of the University of Miami community or in Miami-Dade County.

The situation remains fluid and University guidelines may evolve. We will continue to provide regular updates. This information, as well as prior University advisories and links to additional resources, can be found on the University’s designated coronavirus site at news.miami.edu/coronavirus.

Miami,12-Mar-2020,"To the University of Miami Community,

The University of Miami leadership team, dedicated COVID-19 task force, and emergency management team have been closely monitoring the spread of the coronavirus outbreak while aggressively preparing for contingencies around this rapidly evolving situation. The health and well-being of our community remain our highest priorities.

Over the past 24 hours, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, while Miami-Dade County recorded its first confirmed case and declared a state of emergency. Given these unprecedented circumstances, and following the guidance from Gov. Ron DeSantis, state agencies, and public health officials yesterday, University leadership has made the following immediate decisions:

Spring break has been extended through March 22. Classes will resume on March 23, but strictly in online/remote/distance learning environments through at least April 4.

CLASSES

    Spring break for students has been extended through next week.
    The spring semester will resume on Monday, March 23; however, classes will be provided strictly in online/remote/distance learning environments through at least Saturday, April 4.
    We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and will make a future decision regarding when in-person instruction may resume.
    Faculty should use this time to prepare for online course delivery, which will begin on Monday, March 23. The University has launched an academic and business continuity site to assist faculty members and students in continuing their teaching and learning activities with minimal disruption.


ON-CAMPUS HOUSING, DINING, AND ACTIVITIES

    Residential colleges and designated dining facilities will remain open during this time, based on demand. However, students should consider whether their campus or permanent residence is the safest option during this time.
    Any student who has visited China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea, or Spain is not permitted to return to campus until they have completed a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine period. This remains consistent with earlier guidance.
    Effective Monday, March 16, outside guests will not be permitted inside residential colleges.
    University Libraries, the Shalala Student Center, the Herbert Wellness Center, Student Health Service, and the Counseling Center will remain open.
    The University’s housekeeping services have increased the frequency and depth of cleaning and disinfection in all campus facilities. In addition, the University has placed additional hand-sanitizing stations throughout all campuses.


FOR FACULTY AND STAFF

    Outside of course instruction, all University operations will continue as normal, and faculty and staff are expected to maintain their normal work schedules and activities. This decision is consistent with guidance from public health agencies.
    If you or a member of your household falls into one of the high-risk groups as identified by the CDC, such that you may be advised by a medical professional not to come to work, please contact Human Resources Management.
    Faculty and staff are encouraged to practice social distancing and cough and sneeze etiquette, as well as follow CDC recommendations for handwashing and the use of hand sanitizer.


EVENTS AND ATHLETICS COMPETITIONS

    Effective Sunday, March 15, through at least Tuesday, March 31, all campus events or meetings with 50 of more attendees, including external events, are canceled, with limited exceptions.
    Home athletics competitions will continue but without fans. This decision follows the NCAA decision yesterday to conduct the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments without fans.
    Please refer to the University’s dedicated COVID-19 site for complete, up-to-date guidance on campus events and meetings.


All of the measures outlined above are being done to reduce the potential for the spread of the coronavirus and are in the interest of the safety of our University community.

The University has launched an expanded COVID-19 site with up-to-date guidance, advisories, and links to resources at coronavirus.miami.edu.

The University has allocated funds and secured the necessary supplies and materials to ensure the continuity of operations and is implementing numerous measures to maintain a safe campus environment. Our dedicated COVID-19 task force, which has been meeting since January, continues to work diligently on this unprecedented situation.

We recognize that these actions are disruptive, but they are guided by the recommendations of leading health officials and by our priority to safeguard the health and well-being of our community. We will continue to provide regular updates.",686,fl,3
Miami,13-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty,

The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting our day-to-day lives in many consequential and unexpected ways. But even in the face of this evolving threat, I have been heartened over the past couple of days as the University community has come together and worked to ensure that our core functions—teaching and learning, research and innovation, and patient care—thrive at the U.

While we are concerned with the uncertainty of how this outbreak will impact us, I am convinced the work we do at the University of Miami is more important than ever. I am truly grateful for your continued focus, creativity, and patience in the face of these challenges. I want to thank academic and administrative teams across the university for their strong leadership and decisive and tempered responses.

The steps we are taking to ensure our students can continue to pursue their education and academic goals will require all of us to adapt quickly to new ways to deliver instruction and present course work. At the same time, more than hardware and software, our students will need your understanding and flexibility. We must recognize that their very way of life as college students has been completely disrupted, and they will look to their teachers and advisors for support and guidance. Your enthusiasm to try new teaching techniques will be met by their embrace of fresh pedagogies. The students will look to us as mentors and role models, they will read our verbal and non-verbal cues, and their emotional state will be amplified by what they see in us. Now is the time for us to be renewed and resilient: a common theme among ‘Canes.

We are also providing expanded guidelines and resources to our research enterprise, which, working hand in hand with our clinical faculty, are on the frontlines of providing innovative solutions to challenges like COVID-19.

Next week provides a vital window of opportunity for the institution to launch a new and demanding chapter in our history. Thanks to our previous experience preparing for and responding to hurricanes in South Florida, we have benefited from having actually tested emergency operation plans that allow for business continuation with limited interruptions. Many schools and colleges had been developing or recently completed their academic continuity plans. Well done! Few of us expected we would have the chance to test them so quickly. I encourage you to work closely with your colleagues at the U and across the world to learn valuable lessons and best practices in this new living and learning environment.

You will receive more instructions on course preparation and training when you return to campus next week. Remember to visit our dedicated COVID-19 website for the latest information at coronavirus.miami.edu.

There is still so much we don’t know about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out, but I am sure we will get through this together. I’m proud and amazed at our adaptability. From the bottom of my heart—thank you!

Miami,14-Mar-2020,"UPDATE: HR POLICIES

Dear Gables and Marine campus colleagues (non-UHealth/MSOM),

On Friday, March 13, an email communication was distributed to all Gables and Marine campus leaders (non-UHealth/MSOM) regarding temporary exceptions to policies to encourage social distancing and minimize the number of people on campus in response to COVID-19. These are temporary measures, as we are continuously monitoring this public health crisis, and will evaluate changes as the situation arises. 

The health and well-being of our community remains our priority. 

We have asked managers to use their best judgment and encourage employees to work from home wherever possible and accommodate requests as outlined below while continuing to meet the critical needs of the operation.

Please review the following information carefully and speak with your manager about remote work options.

The following are guidelines for Coral Gables and Marine campus employees effective March 14 through April 4.
TELECOMMUTING OPTIONS

Friday, March 13 was a test of capability for a wide range of employees to work from home. To evaluate our efforts, there will be a survey emailed Monday, March 16 to all Coral Gables and Marine campus employees asking for feedback. It is critical to have your participation in this survey regardless of whether you worked from home or worked from your regular office space. The information will allow us to plan and prepare for potential disruptions due to COVID-19.

Employees may be eligible for a work-from-home arrangement if job duties are not required to be performed on site, do not directly provide on-site support to students, and can be performed remotely with minimal disruption. There are many tools that can be used in assessing whether work can be performed from home, the list of remote access tools available on the remote access technologies website may be helpful.

Note: All work-from-home arrangements require a manager’s advance approval.

Once it is determined that job duties can be performed from home, managers were advised to prioritize in assigning work-from-home arrangements. 

CDC guidelines on individuals most vulnerable:

Employees who fall into one of the high-risk groups as identified by the CDC and have notified their managers that they have an underlying chronic medical condition that makes them especially vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus should be considered a priority in accommodating a work-from-home arrangement, wherever feasible. If a work from home arrangement is not possible, employees in this category will be eligible to use accrued paid time (sick leave/vacation or floating holidays) so that they may self-isolate at home to reduce risk. Employees in this category may be required to provide medical documentation.

School or Daycare Closure:

Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-19 daycare or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use accrued paid leave time (sick leave/vacation or floating days) during this period.

Employees may not bring children or any relatives to work with them, particularly during this time. 

Rotational Options:

Once the above priorities have been considered, departments are encouraged to implement broader measures to foster work-from-home arrangements that minimize the number of employees on campus while fulfilling critical operations. This may include rotating staff working from home and some remaining on site, essentially a Team A and Team B approach.
PAID SICK TIME  

Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of the University community and encourage all those who are ill, or caring for those who are ill, to remain at home. In that spirit, we are implementing temporary measures to enable employees affected by COVID-19 to focus on getting well without concern of losing pay.

    Employees unable to work due to their own or their family member’s COVID-19 symptoms should remain at home and utilize sick time. If accrued sick time has been exhausted, staff will be eligible to borrow from future sick time not to exceed 21 business days (or up to 168 hours) during this period.
    Temporary or per diem employees unable to work due to their own COVID-19 symptoms who have provided appropriate medical documentation, will be provided paid administrative leave for a period of up to 2 weeks equal to their normal work schedule.


Travel Restrictions:

Employees currently returning from the affected countries identified by the CDC, are required to remain at home in self-isolation for 14-days on administrative paid leave. Employees are required to contact Infection Control at (786) 427-5018 to report their return from travel.

If an employee chooses to travel to one of these countries after the latest set of restrictions published on March 11, they will still be required to self-isolate upon return but will need to use their own accrued paid time off to remain in pay status. We strongly discourage all international travel and domestic travel that requires any form of mass transportation, except for local mass transit.

All employees should continue to take preventive actions during this time to avoid the spread of the virus. For continuous updates on COVID-19, please refer to the University’s dedicated COVID-19 site ( coronavirus.miami.edu) for complete, up-to-date guidance on campus events and meetings. 

Please continue to work with your supervisor and leaders as we monitor COVID-19 and the related public health guidelines. For additional assistance, please reach out to your manager or HR partner. 

Thank you for all that you continue to do as we work to care for our families, staff, faculty, and the broader UM community.

The University of Miami leadership team, COVID-19 task force, and emergency management team continue to take proactive measures—following the guidance of public health and government agencies—to safeguard the health and safety of our community. As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve, University leadership has made the following immediate decisions:

In accordance with public health guidance to reduce density on campus, and due to the likelihood of further travel restrictions in the coming days, the move to online instruction has been extended through the remainder of the spring semester, which will conclude on May 6. Also, we will implement partial closing of on-campus housing beginning March 25.

CLASSES

    Classes and labs will resume on March 23, but strictly in online/remote/distance learning environments through the remainder of the spring semester, which will conclude on May 6.
    Faculty should continue to prepare for online course delivery, which will begin on Monday, March 23. Additional resources to assist faculty members and students in continuing their teaching and learning activities with minimal disruption can be found on the academic and business continuity site and on coronavirus.miami.edu.


ON-CAMPUS HOUSING

    In accordance with public health guidance to reduce density on campus, and due to the likelihood of further travel restrictions in the coming days, we will implement partial closing of on-campus housing beginning March 25.
        We strongly encourage all students to return to their permanent residence and not remain in on-campus housing.
        Limited exceptions will be made for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere.
        Although encouraged, students do not need to remove their personal belongings from their room immediately. Students will have until May 8 at 5 p.m. to return to campus to pick up their items and fully check out of their housing assignment.
        Room and board costs will be pro-rated for the remainder of the semester for all students leaving campus. Additional information will be forthcoming.
        Students who need extensions to pick up personal belongings or who need to remain in on-campus housing must complete an exemption request via the housing portal available in CaneLink no later than March 23 at noon.
        We will make every effort to accommodate students and each case will receive individual attention. If you have questions, please contact housing@miami.edu.
    Most on-campus facilities will be closed. The Wellness Center at both the Coral Gables and medical campuses and the University Center pool will be closed. University Libraries will be closed but will provide online access to resources. The Counseling Center will not hold in-person appointments but will offer telemedicine. The University Center complex, including the Shalala Student Center, will have restricted access.


FOR FACULTY AND STAFF

    As communicated on Sunday, the University has activated temporary exceptions to policies to encourage social distancing and minimize the number of people on campus. In consultation with their supervisors, employees whose duties can be performed remotely are encouraged to work from home.
    We would like to reiterate that if you are sick, or think you are sick, please stay at home. Do not come to work and please contact your medical care provider.
    The Faculty Club dining facility will be closed.
    Campus buildings will be restricted. ’Cane Cards will be required to gain access to buildings, classrooms, and offices.

This person is in good condition and is self-isolating to prevent the spread of infection to others. Our best wishes have been extended to the individual for a rapid recovery.

The positive test results are considered presumptive, pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We are following the recommended CDC and public health protocols to inform and provide guidance to those who have been in close contact with this individual during the period when they might have been contagious. Out of respect for patient privacy and because this is a public health issue, there will not be any further information about individual cases beyond notifications to our community.

We recognize that any positive test is likely to increase anxiety among the medical campus and University community. A positive test result—presumptive or confirmed—underscores the need for the University, the health system, and the medical school to continue a swift and comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak:

    We have shifted to online instruction for all classes at all University of Miami campuses;
    We have established a policy on remote work for all employees;
    We have strongly encouraged students in on-campus housing to return to their permanent residence and will partially close on-campus housing beginning March 25;
    We continue to seek the best guidance from public health experts, including those at the University and our UHealth system;
    We are sanitizing all facilities and public spaces on a continuous basis.


UHealth and the Miller School of Medicine’s expert physicians continue to work with the Centers for Disease Control, establishing protocols for the protection of all who enter our hospitals, clinical spaces, and research and medical education areas, including:

    Screening all visitors at clinical entry points and over the phone, documenting their travel history and any symptoms they may currently be experiencing;
    Moving suspected patients immediately to an isolated room for further examination;
    Having dedicated isolation rooms and clinical staff for any presumptive and confirmed patients;
    Equipping clinical staff with approved and recommended personal protective equipment (PPE);
    Establishing a policy of remote work for non-clinical employees.

We recognize how important commencement is for you, your classmates, and loved ones. However, following guidance from state and federal agencies to suspend large events and promote social distancing due to COVID-19, undergraduate, graduate, and law May 2020 commencement ceremonies will be postponed until December 2020.

We are so proud of the effort you have extended to complete your degree. We realize that the postponement of May commencement ceremonies is extremely disappointing, and we did not reach this decision lightly. It was made by keeping the health and safety of our campus community and your families and loved ones in mind. We are disappointed for you and disappointed with you. This is also our chance to recognize and thank you. We’re sorry - the world pandemic has created unprecedented times.

I want to assure you that, you will still earn your degree and be considered a graduate of the University of Miami upon completion of your academic requirements, regardless of whether or not you are able to attend your ceremony in December.

Please note, Fall 2020 candidates will still have their own ceremonies as previously scheduled for Thursday, December 17, 2020. Additionally, all Senior Send-Off events for this semester, including the Commencement Ball, have been canceled.

For students who may not be able to join in December, the Office of Commencement is working to provide options to receive your regalia and diploma cover as well as Stoles of Gratitude. More information will be available in the coming weeks at commencement.miami.edu and via e-mail.

Miami,21-Mar-2020,"Dear Deans and Faculty,

On Monday we launch a bold endeavor at the University of Miami with the full implementation of online learning. This transition has required hours of training, reworking of courses and syllabi, and translating your teaching into digital platforms—all accomplished in a single week. This is an extraordinary testament to your hard work and dedication. Your professionalism, creativity, enthusiasm, and willingness to engage in new experiments in pedagogy will forever, and indelibly, change the University of Miami. Thank you!

Most importantly, we have forged even stronger relationships with our partners across the University, including UMIT (and Instructional Technologies) and other areas in Business and Finance; the Division of Continuing and International Education, which has been on the forefront of online learning and provided tested models for us to follow; and the Division of Student Affairs, whose advocacy for students’ needs ensures we always put our students health, welfare, and UM experience first.

Undoubtedly there will be challenges ahead. While we are in uncharted waters, and the scale of conversion is unprecedented, every journey begins with that first dramatic new step. Some might say that this began when we started stepping up efforts to build a robust academic continuity infrastructure following Hurricane Irma. Few of us were thinking of a quickly spreading global pandemic; yet, hurricane or pandemic, the ramifications of our efforts will continue to ripple through not only higher education but all areas of our lives in unforeseen ways. We are a better and stronger institution as a result of your efforts.

I want to thank each of you for committing to the success of our students in completing their spring semester. We are resilient and committed. We are ’Canes.

Miami,24-Mar-2020,"COVID-19: HR UPDATES

Dear colleagues,

For the past few weeks, all of us have been navigating unprecedented change at work and at home. We’ve had to pivot where, how, and when we work, while caring for our families, uncertain of how events will unfold.

I am not alone in my deep gratitude for the work all of you are doing. University leadership recognizes the challenges that each of you are facing, and we appreciate you.

As you know, we have required telecommuting arrangements to limit the number of people on our campuses to those who provide essential support to our patients, students and faculty. Whether reporting on campus or demonstrating flexibility through work at home solutions - we are all in this together. It is important that you respect your managers’ guidance and not report to campus if you are instructed to remain at home.

The health and well-being of our University community remains our top priority and our policies remain fluid as we move quickly to respond to national, state and local guidance. During times like these, some may experience worry and may need emotional support. Our Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) is available and remains open at 305-284-6604 or visit fsap.miami.edu. For additional resources, please refer to the FAQs.

To support staff through these challenging times, we have communicated temporary policies in effect through April 17 that outline pay continuity provisions and enhanced sick options. These updates include guidance on telecommuting from home and are outlined in the updated FAQs.

Additionally, consistent with Miami Dade’s suspension of transit fares, UM payroll deductions for transit, tri-rail and parking will be suspended effective March 19 and until further notice. Hourly staff with deductions will see this change in their March 27 pay; exempt employees in their March month-end pay.

IMPORTANT

For employees who have transitioned to a remote work arrangement, please log in to Workday and complete the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement each week that you work from home. This mechanism will also allow us to retroactively provide any payments for the use of personal cell phones as appropriate. For assistance, please review the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement in Workday Tip Sheet.

Note: If you are working from home and are an hourly employee:

    In Workday, please continue to input your hours as you normally would.
    In Kronos, please contact your supervisor and/or timekeeper for alternative instructions.

 

If your only option while working from home is to use a personal computer, laptop, or other device, you are required to adhere to University practices and policies to maintain security on your device. Please see additional guidance and resources FAQs.

For assistance completing the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement in Workday or for other questions around COVID-19 temporary policies please contact your manager or HR Partner. For any technical issues including Workday, please email workday@miami.edu.

I have heard stories of the resilience of our ‘Canes family in areas across the University—from those who support our students and operations to those who are caring for our patients on the front line —I appreciate your dedication and commitment to the communities we serve.

Miami,25-Mar-2020,"To University of Miami Students and Families:

As the University of Miami continues its proactive and comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize the financial strain faced by many families during these unprecedented times. To help alleviate some of these concerns, the University is planning to issue prorated reimbursements for housing, meal plans, and parking in some form for any student who leaves campus.
 
The University will continue to provide students with academic instruction as well as an array of resources, all through online platforms, including tutoring, career counseling, student involvement opportunities, and counseling services.
 
Housing information

    Students who complete the housing check-out process by the March 25, 2020, deadline will have charges prorated as of that date and a credit issued to their student account. Students who do not complete the check-out process by March 25 or have not made alternate arrangements with Housing and Residential Life may have a proration date later than March 25. (Housing and Residential Life questions: housing@miami.edu)

 
Dining information

    Spring meal plan costs (minus Dining Dollar balances) will be prorated to March 25, 2020, or the last day of usage, whichever is later, and a credit will be issued to the student account. Dining Dollar balances will remain available for use through Oct. 15, 2020. Graduating seniors with Dining Dollar balances may be eligible for a prorated refund. (Dining questions: diningservices@miami.edu)

 
Parking information

    Student parking permit costs will be prorated to March 25, 2020, and a credit will be issued to the student account. Students whose vehicles remain on campus will not receive a credit/refund and those vehicles may continue to utilize on-campus parking without receiving a citation through the start of the Fall 2020 semester. (Parking questions: parking.gables@miami.edu)

 
Study abroad

    Students who participated in University of Miami study abroad programs should refer to official communications provided by the University’s Study Abroad office regarding any credits/refunds. (Study abroad questions: studyabroad@miami.edu)

 
Please note, the possibility of credits/refunds will be determined by a student’s individual financial aid circumstances. The Office of Student Accounts will review accounts for any outstanding balances before issuing a credit/refund.

Miami,25-Mar-2020,"To the University of Miami Community:

Earlier this evening, the City of Coral Gables issued a “safer at home” order, effective at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, that requires residents and businesses to restrict non-essential activities.

Here is guidance regarding University operations:

The order does not impact online learning.

    All online classes will continue to meet as normal and course schedules will not change.

The order does not impact critical University operations, employee work arrangements, or research functions.

    Last week, the University implemented new Human Resources policies that are consistent with this city order. As Human Resources communicated last week, only critical operations that need to be performed on-site, certain student contact activities, and teaching-related support, should be performed on campus. All other functions should be performed from home whenever possible.

Students should continue to practice social distancing and limit mobility.

    The order strongly urges individuals to remain in their place of residence, with limited exceptions. The order does allow travel to grocery stories, pharmacies, banks, gas stations, and other operations critical to day-to-day activities. Individuals may engage in outdoor physical activities, as long as social distancing practices are observed.
    Dining Services will continue to provide take-out food service. The latest details regarding available dining options and hours of operations can be found at www.dineoncampus.com/miami.

Miami,26-Mar-2020,"To the University of Miami Community:

The impact COVID-19 has had and will continue to have on our community—and the global economy—is unprecedented. Yet, even in the face of such disruption, we are fulfilling our mission of teaching, research, innovation, and service.

We should all be encouraged by the fact that this week our students were able to return to class fully online, thanks to the extraordinary efforts and teamwork of faculty and staff. Beyond adapting to a new reality for teaching and learning, our mission as a comprehensive research university with an academic health system compels us to play three important roles in the face of COVID-19.

Our first role is to care for our own community. With nearly 18,000 students and approximately 17,000 employees, we are responsible for prioritizing the health and safety of 35,000 people and their loved ones.

Our second role, carried out by the academic health system, is to provide health care to our surrounding community. We know our colleagues at UHealth are feeling the pressure acutely, as the number of confirmed cases continues to rise.

Our third role is as researchers, with involvement on the front lines of both care and innovation. As we speak, our scientists are hard at work developing the tools necessary to beat this pandemic, from diagnostics to drugs to vaccines.

During an event like this one, no news is not seen as good news. Quite the opposite—the absence of information feeds fear. We know you have questions and we want to answer them.

As we carry out our mission and embrace each of our roles, I am delighted to announce that next Tuesday and Wednesday, we will hold a series of virtual town hall meetings with the University community.

The University’s dedicated COVID-19 site, which can be found at coronavirus.miami.edu, is updated constantly and will continue to serve as the most up-to-date source of information regarding the University’s comprehensive response to the pandemic. Information specific to our medical community can be found at http://my.med.miami.edu.

Details on how to participate in our virtual town hall meetings will follow, including how you can submit questions you want us to address. We look forward to a candid and productive conversation.

Miami,26-Mar-2020,"Dear Students,

For many of you, this was your first week of online courses at the University of Miami. Similarly, it was the first time that many of your professors have taught in this virtual environment. We hope that everyone has been able to settle in to their new routines and support each other during this time.

Life is anything but normal right now, and it is too soon to know how the next few months will unfold. Our recent decisions to cancel ongoing study abroad programs, move classes online, and partially close campus housing are all necessary for the health and safety of the University community.  By limiting social interaction, we will help to slow the spread of COVID-19 and support our health systems nationwide. Particularly at this time, we want to stress the continued importance of preventative measures including physical distancing and proper handwashing, and we urge you to continue to check the University’s COVID-19 response website for the latest information.

Support Services
In addition to moving courses online, our support services, including the Counseling Center, still have resources available to our students. Please visit their website to learn about their current offerings available to you. Additionally, Student Health Service remains open to serve students in the area.

The Camner Center for Academic Resources continues to host virtual tutoring sessions and is adding a range of workshops to assist you with the shift to online learning. Additionally, your academic advisors will be reaching out to help you with course selection and to provide support as we look ahead to the Fall semester.

Resident Students
For resident students who have not returned to campus housing since the start of spring break, we are working on a plan to allow you to retrieve your belongings in a way that is safe for all members of the University community. You will receive more information at a later date.

Grading
The deans and Faculty Senate leadership have been discussing the issue of grades, both within UM and amongst our national colleagues.  There are many students, both undergraduate and graduate, law and medicine, some with financial aid that may be dependent on progression, or others who must maintain a specific GPA to continue enrollment in special programs. These factors, and others, were considered carefully in formulating a decision that required a great deal of thought and planning.

For the Spring 2020 semester only, undergraduate schools and colleges will allow students to opt-in to taking some or all of their courses for Credit/No Credit or they can continue with letter grades. Credit/No-credit is the University of Miami’s version of Pass/Fail; a grade of C or better is required to receive credit.  For any course in which a student wants to retain their letter grades, no action is necessary.

    This will allow undergraduate students to take any or all courses under this grading basis. Courses taken for CR/NC grades during Spring 2020 will count towards major, minors, cognates/general education, and degree requirements (subject to final Faculty Senate approval).
    CR/NC grades are not calculated into a student's GPA, so some students may not have a semester GPA for Spring 2020. Given this, honor rolls will not be in effect for Spring 2020. 
    If a student elects to take a course CR/NC, they will receive a CR if they earn a letter grade of A+ through C.  If they earn a letter grade of C- through F, they will receive a NC. 
    The limit on the number of courses that can be taken CR/NC in a single semester is suspended for the Spring 2020 semester.
    Undergraduate courses taken CR/NC in the Spring 2020 will not count towards the University’s maximum nine-credit hour limit on the total number of courses that can be counted towards a degree.
    The University of Miami will add a notation to the transcript key indicating the reason for the grade options for Spring 2020.
    Students must submit an online request to receive CR/NC instead of a letter grade for each course they choose; the online form will be available shortly on the Registrar’s website.  Students will have until 11:59 p.m. on May 8 to make this selection for each course they choose to take CR/NC.  Grades, transcripts, and other semester academic records will be posted by May 21, as opposed to the originally planned date of May 13.


Graduation
We share in your disappointment at the way that your time on campus this semester was cut short. For those graduating, we intentionally rescheduled our May ceremonies to December to allow you and your families the opportunity to participate in this important recognition of your academic achievements. We hope that you can join us, and we look forward to welcoming you and your loved ones back to campus once it is safe to do so.

Caring for Yourself and One Another
It is especially important to remember that ’Canes Care for ’Canes. By supporting one another during this unprecedented time, we will persevere and emerge as a stronger community, equipped with new skills and approaches to collaborating, meeting, and learning.

And caring for your fellow ’Canes also means caring for yourself. Many of you are back at home working through new dynamics and changes, in addition to shifting to online learning and continuing to be active in your co-curricular activities.

We want to thank all of you for your resiliency, patience, and flexibility.  We are in uncharted waters, and there will still be challenges ahead. Your health and safety are our priority, and your ability to learn and complete your education is at the forefront of our efforts.

The deans, graduate associate deans, and Faculty Senate leadership have been discussing the issue of grades, both within UM and among our national colleagues. There are many students, both undergraduate and graduate, law and medicine, some with financial aid that may be dependent on progression, or others who must maintain a specific GPA to continue enrollment in special programs. These factors, and others, were considered carefully in formulating a decision that required a great deal of thought and planning.

For the Spring 2020 semester only, schools and colleges will allow graduate students to opt-in to taking some or all of their courses for Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) or to continue with letter grades. For any course in which a student wants to retain their letter grades, no action is necessary.

    This will allow graduate students to take any or all courses under this grading basis. Courses taken for (S/U) grades during Spring 2020 will count towards their degree requirements (subject to final Faculty Senate approval).
    (S/U) grades are not calculated into a student's GPA, so some students may not have a semester GPA for Spring 2020.
    If a student elects to take a course for S/U, they will receive a “S” if they earn a B or higher. If they earn a letter grade of B- or lower, they will receive a “U.”
    The University of Miami will add a notation to the transcript key indicating the reason for the grade options for Spring 2020.
    Students must submit an online request to receive (S/U) instead of a letter grade for each course they choose; the online form will be available shortly on the Registrar’s website. Students will have until 11:59 p.m. EST on May 8, to make this selection for each course they choose to take S/U. Grades, transcripts, and other semester academic records will be posted by May 21, as opposed to the originally planned date of May 13.


Graduation
We share in your disappointment at the way that your time on campus this semester was cut short. For those graduating, we intentionally rescheduled our May ceremonies to December to allow you and your families the opportunity to participate in this important recognition of your academic achievements. We hope that you can join us, and we look forward to welcoming you and your loved ones back to campus once it is safe to do so.

Caring for Yourself and One Another
It is especially important to remember that ’Canes Care for ’Canes. By supporting one another during this unprecedented time, we will persevere and emerge as a stronger community, equipped with new skills and approaches to collaborating, meeting, and learning.

And caring for your fellow ’Canes also means caring for yourself. Many of you are back at home working through new dynamics and changes, in addition to shifting to online learning and continuing to be active in your co-curricular activities.

We want to thank all of you for your resiliency, patience, and flexibility. We are in uncharted waters, and there will still be challenges ahead. Your health and safety are our priority, and your ability to learn and complete your education is at the forefront of our efforts.

If you have any feedback, please feel free to reach out to us at graduateschool@miami.edu, VPSA@miami.edu, or provost.office@miami.edu. If you or someone you know is facing extreme challenges, we want to hear from you.

Dear Coral Gables and Marine Campus (non-UHealth) Colleagues:

Two weeks ago, we welcomed students back to classes virtually, as our academic health system ramped up for a surge in demand due to COVID-19. Since then, we have adapted to a new reality. The days are long and the statistics sobering, yet our commitment to the University of Miami and UHealth—and to each other—has never been more apparent.

Last week, I was delighted to hear directly from so many in the community as we addressed some of the challenges ahead during our first virtual town hall meetings. The pandemic with which the world is grappling has serious short- and long-term implications, and it is vital to keep our lines of communication open.

Our first order of business has been to face, head on, the implications of the health crisis. Our priority remains your health and safety, as UHealth engages in saving lives with every resource at our disposal.

We do not yet know exactly what the long-term implications of this pandemic will look like, but we do know that the disruption wrought by COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on the economy. If we are to fulfill our sacred mission in today’s highly uncertain economic environment, we must acknowledge that the implications of the pandemic will also be financial.

The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees met on Friday. We are looking at all possible scenarios and taking steps to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19. There are steps that we must take now, and there may be additional steps in the future. You will receive more detailed communications from Provost Jeffrey Duerk and COO Jackie Travisano this week outlining the specific expense reduction measures we will be taking.

We remain committed to our mission of education, research, innovation, and service—and the most important element in carrying out that mission is our people. Thank you for all the ways you are living our values in these unprecedented times.

Continue to stay safe, care for your loved ones, and focus on our shared mission. Our resilience will carry us through anything that lies ahead.

Miami,07-Apr-2020,"Dear University of Miami Community,

As you may know, there’s a new form of internet trolling called “Zoombombing”— in which an uninvited participant uses Zoom’s screen-sharing feature to disrupt meetings and classes.

Regardless of whether you are a professor hosting online classes via Zoom, a staff member running Zoom meetings, or a leader of an affiliated group bringing people together via Zoom, here are some tips to help you keep your Zoom video meetings secure:

Set a meeting password
Zoom recently enabled all accounts to automatically require a password when creating a meeting (click here to learn more about setting or removing passwords).

Enable a waiting room
The waiting room feature allows the host to control when participants join your meeting. As the meeting host, you can admit attendees individually, or hold all attendees in the virtual waiting room and admit all when you are ready to begin.

Limit screen sharing
Zoom recently updated its screen-sharing settings for all accounts to automatically default to “Only Host.” This setting gives hosts sole permission to share content within their meetings by default. Click here to learn more about this setting, including how to enable screen sharing when needed.

Ensure you are using the latest version of the Zoom client
This will ensure all of the latest privacy and security features are available. Visit https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Where-Do-I-Download-The-Latest-Version-

Additional security measures
To further enhance safety, University of Miami community members can disable ‘join before host,’ ‘lock the meeting,’ ‘remove a participant,’ and ‘restrict who can join.’

Visit our Zoombombing resources site for all tips on how to stay secure: it.miami.edu/zoombombing.

Note that for clinical visits using Zoom, UHealth uses a special version of Zoom which is integrated with UChart, specific for telemedicine encounters. UChart secures these Zoom sessions through advanced encryption, restricts link distribution, and disables the ability to record the sessions. It is highly unlikely that telemedicine sessions will be disrupted by Zoombombing.

If you would like assistance understanding the security settings in Zoom, please contact the UMIT Service Desk at 305-284-6565 or help@miami.edu. If you learn of a meeting where Zoombombing occurred, please contact IT Security at ciso@miami.edu.

As always, feel free to reach out to me directly anytime at erniefernandez@miami.edu.

Miami,07-Apr-2020,"To Employees at the Coral Gables and Marine Campuses (non-UHealth),

We would like to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the way you have joined together, in the spirit of One U, to ensure the University continues to fulfill its mission during these unprecedented times. Just a few months ago, the prospect of moving the entire teaching and administrative functions of the University to an online/remote environment would have been thought impossible. Yet today, that is our reality, and everyone is continuing to do their part to achieve one of the most remarkable accomplishments in our University’s storied history.

As we shared during a recent virtual town hall, today’s highly uncertain economic environment poses serious financial implications for our University, as well as for our health care system, UHealth. These are unprecedented times, which require significant measures. We are taking the following actions to reduce expenses, effective immediately, to preserve our mission of teaching, research, innovation, and service as we approach our centennial.

1. Hiring Freeze: There will be a hiring freeze for faculty and staff positions until at least the end of the calendar year. This includes all new positions and all vacant positions but does not include student worker positions. HR will establish a process to establish any exceptions, which will be rare.

This hiring freeze does not impact offers that have already been extended and each dean will review with the provost the status of authorized searches for faculty positions and jointly determine those that will proceed and those that will be paused.

We may ask you to operate in vastly different ways, to assume new responsibilities, or to help across units where there are vacancies to ensure operational continuity in these extraordinary times.

2. Postpone FY21 Merit Funding: Postponing FY21 merit funding will allow us time to quantify our fall enrollment and to further quantify the financial impact to the UHealth system from COVID-19.

3. FY21 Non-Compensation Expense Reductions: All budget centers, including colleges, schools, and administrative/operational departments will significantly reduce or eliminate travel, entertainment, outside services, consulting, conferences, meetings, and other non-essential, non-salary expenses.

4. Capital Projects Pause: Capital projects that are already under construction will continue (for example, Lakeside Village and the Student Services Building on the Coral Gables campus). However, we have postponed nearly every other capital expenditure until fiscal year 2022.

5. Use of Donor Funds: In addition to being good for donor stewardship, units are asked to use operating gifts and spendable endowment income balances in advance of unrestricted funds.

6. Expanding First-Year Class: Working with the Office of Enrollment Management, we hope to welcome 2,350 new ’Canes as first-year students in Fall 2020.

As previously mentioned, the University’s telecommuting and temporary pay practices have been extended through April 30, 2020. We will reassess these policies and communicate any changes in advance of that date. In the short term, we have quickly adapted to physical distancing practices while providing support to our frontline health care workers who are preparing for an increase in COVID-19 cases. Our next phase will be to stand together to face the financial implications that lie ahead and make sacrifices to sustain our University.

We know that these steps will not be easy, and there may be additional financial measures that we may need to consider. But ’Canes are resilient, and we will get through this challenge together and will emerge an even stronger U.

Finally, ’Canes Care for ’Canes. We wish you and your families good health and safety. If there is anything we can do for you, or if you have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

Miami,14-Apr-2020,"Dear staff colleagues,

As previously communicated, the University’s temporary telecommuting guidelines have been extended through April 30, 2020. As a reminder to staff working from home full time or partially, we ask that you please log in to Workday and complete the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement for each week that you work from home by noon on Friday, April 17. Properly recording your time will ensure that you receive the appropriate Technology Work From Home stipend to compensate for expenses temporarily incurred while working from home. For assistance, please review the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement in Workday Tip Sheet.

Consistent with the CDC recommendation, we urge everyone to wear a cloth face covering, or mask, where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. In addition, the recently issued Miami Dade Order requires persons working in or visiting grocery stores, pharmacies, construction sites, public transit vehicles, vehicles for hire, and locations where social distancing is not possible to wear facial coverings as defined by the CDC. This additional public health measure is in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The use of facemasks is crucial for health workers and those taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). Wearing medical masks on the UHealth campus is required of all employees and visitors. For UHealth personal protection guidelines and information specific to the medical campus, please visit my.med.miami.edu and review the ""Process and Procedures"" tab.

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:

The University of Miami continues to proactively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard the health and safety of our community and the broader communities we serve, and to plan for the future. In an effort to keep the University community continuously informed, we write to provide you with an update regarding summer term course delivery and additional University resources.

SUMMER AND FALL TERMS
Registration for the summer and fall terms opened this week. To prioritize safety and health, the University will conduct summer sessions that begin in May online, including Summer A and Summer C. Select courses in Summer C may transition to on-campus instruction later in the summer if it is deemed safe to do so.

We are happy to announce that additional courses have been added to the summer schedule to ensure we are offering courses students need and want. The Registrar’s office worked jointly with the academic deans to identify courses most popular among students, as well as courses needed for academic progress. Periodically, the Registrar’s office will send an email to students to introduce newly offered courses, and we encourage you to look for those emails.

At present, there are no changes to the fall semester schedule or course offerings. We will continue to evaluate the public health emergency, working closely with government and public health agencies, to determine if changes to the academic calendar or manner of course delivery are needed. Any changes will be communicated directly to the University community.

As always, students are strongly encouraged to discuss their course selections with their academic advisors.

LEARNING RESOURCES
The University has created additional support for remote technologies that allow faculty and students to continue their teaching and learning activities. To learn more, visit it.miami.edu/continuity.

STAYING CONNECTED

Miami,23-Apr-2020,"Dear staff colleagues,

Thank you for your dedication, creativity and compassion through this most challenging time. It’s been tough for us all, as our work and personal lives have been altered by COVID-19. In just a matter of weeks, we have been able to accomplish so much to continue critical University operations and support financial mitigation efforts – united as a team. We have begun to shift our focus from rapid responses to the COVID-19 crisis to proactive planning for the future.

We continue to follow national, state, and local guidance and recognize that a full resumption of work on campus will not be possible by April 30th. In light of this, temporary work-at-home arrangements will continue until further notice and a phased return to campus will occur when it’s deemed safe to resume operations. Technology Work from home stipends related to COVID-19 temporary arrangements will also continue until further notice. Please log in to Workday and continue to complete the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement for each week that you work from home. For assistance, please review the COVID-19 Telecommute Arrangement in Workday Tip Sheet.

There have been several COVID-19-specific exceptions in our pay and reimbursement policies that were highlighted in various communications. These temporary policies have been extended as outlined below.
Highlights
Administrative Leave – Other

Staff are required to work from home whenever possible until further notice. If the nature of their job duties cannot be performed at home and cannot continue to be performed on campus due to the nature of the job or site closure, staff may be required to be deployed to other areas to remain in a pay status. If the University is unable to identify a redeployment assignment, staff will be required to remain accessible from home to perform other duties as needed and will remain in full pay status via Administrative – Other for the duration of the temporary policy, which is extended until May 15th for all campuses. We will assess and communicate any changes prior to that date.
Emergency Administrative Leave

Staff who are instructed by UHealth Infection Control to self-isolate to contain the spread of COVID-19, are eligible for Emergency Administrative time for scheduled hours up to the defined period for isolation not to exceed 14 days if their job duties cannot be performed at home. This temporary policy will continue until further notice.
Staff illness due to COVID-19

In addition to their accumulated sick time or Extended Illness Bank (EIB), PTO, floating holidays and other time off, staff who are symptomatic and/or are diagnosed with COVID-19- related illness, continue to be eligible for the following exception provision until further notice:

    If all sick/EIB and other time off banks are exhausted, eligible staff can borrow up to 21 days from their sick banks

Staff enrolled in short term disability should apply for benefits.

New COVID-19 Provision: If Worker’s Compensation claim demonstrates evidence of COVID-19 being contracted as a result of occupation, emergency administrative pay will be utilized to bridge the gap between Worker’s Compensation and full salary. 
Staff affected by school closures or designated by CDC/Miami Dade as vulnerable to COVID-19

If remote work is not operationally feasible, staff may use accrued sick/EIB time in addition to vacation/PTO or floating holidays to which they are normally eligible to care for children who are at home as a result of school closures. Employees deemed to be essential to operations who opt out of University day care support will be ineligible to use sick bank time for this purpose.

Staff who are unable to work from home and fall into one of the high-risk groups as identified by the CDC and Miami-Dade County, State of Florida will be eligible to use accrued sick time/EIB in addition to vacation/PTO or floating holidays so that they may self-isolate at home to reduce risk. If sick/EIB/vacation/PTO time are exhausted, staff who fall in this category can borrow up to 21 days from their future sick/EIB bank.

These temporary sick leave provisions have been extended until further notice.
Payroll Deduction Suspensions & Reimbursements

Miami Dade Transit, tri-rail, and parking

Transit, tri-rail and parking payroll deductions will be suspended, effective March 19, until May 31.

Herbert Wellness Center and the UHealth Fitness and Wellness Center

Effective April 1, payroll deductions for membership fees for faculty and staff have been suspended and will be suspended until the Wellness Center resumes operation.

Child Care

HR implemented a one-time tuition waiver in April for our onsite childcare services (Canterbury on Gables, Medical, the UHealth Tower, and the Debbie School). Many employees are telecommuting, and spaces have been used for clinical care employees required to report to work. The tuition waiver will continue through the end of May so available slots can be utilized by healthcare workers.

I recognize that there is still so much uncertainty but hope that the extension of these temporary policies and telecommuting arrangements will provide some peace of mind.   Senior leadership continues to assess the financial impact of COVID-19 and will continue to communicate as quickly and directly as possible.

I encourage us all to be compassionate and show empathy with each other - especially during these times. There are many ways we can do this - reaching out to a colleague to offer support, send some “Words of Appreciation” to our UHealth heroes, or give a gift to the UHealth/Miller School of Medicine Emergency Response Fund that will make all the difference.

If you need assistance completing your Workday telecommuting arrangement or have any questions, please reach out to your manager or HR Partner. For any technical issues including Workday, please email workday@miami.edu.

Miami,28-Apr-2020,"Dear Colleagues,

South Florida and the University of Miami know more about disaster and resilience than most regions and most universities. Even so, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every dimension of society, in virtually every corner of the world. As we continue to manage through the profound public health crisis, the economic crisis in its wake will be even more far reaching.

I am deeply proud of how our community has mobilized in response to the coronavirus, from our health care heroes on the front lines to the intellectual contributions of our public health, medical, and nursing researchers, and the innovation and adaptability displayed by our students, faculty, and staff as the balance of our semester moved online in March.

We at the U know better than most that acting early and deliberately, guided by values and a commitment to every member of our community, will allow us to weather even the most difficult storms and build back better. It is in the spirit of early, deliberate action that I am writing today.

At the beginning of this month, we shared our immediate actions to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19. Today, I share with you the next phase of those efforts.

First, some context: As a result of the strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies we have put in place through the Roadmap to our New Centuryand the generosity of our donors, we are confronting this crisis from our strongest financial standing in more than a decade. In fact, we were poised for another outstanding financial and academic year.

COVID-19 radically altered that picture, and we must now navigate significant financial losses from areas across the University, including clinical and student-related revenues, reduced research activities, and an endowment feeling the impact as investment markets around the globe have declined. We are committed to evaluating every possible scenario to minimize both the short- and long-term effects of this crisis on our University.

Without any substantial mitigation efforts in place, our projections show potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming year. Our actions are guided by these sobering projections. The following measures apply to the entire University:

Salary reductions for senior leadership
Recognizing the number of families already facing financial hardships, we will begin reducing expenses at the leadership ranks of the organization. I, along with the provost, chief operating officer, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, deans, and equivalent positions at UHealth will reduce our compensation by 15 percent starting on May 1. In addition, those employees whose compensation falls in the top one percent of earners at the University will be asked to voluntarily reduce their compensation by 10 percent. Human Resources will share details with those impacted by this action.

Suspension of retirement contributions for FY21
Effective June 1, the University will temporarily suspend contributions, both core and matching, to employee 403(b) plans, including grandfathered over-the-limit taxable contributions through fiscal year 2021. We take this step with full realization that it will have an impact on your plans for the future. Employees can continue their elective contributions, within IRS limits.

Suspension of merit increases for FY21
We will suspend merit increases on all campuses for FY21. This is a temporary measure that in no way diminishes the deep appreciation we have for the excellent work of our employees.

Hiring freeze for all positions on all campuses
As announced by Provost Duerk and Dr. Travisano on April 7, we will continue the hiring freeze on all vacant and new positions at least through December 2020 on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses. We are now extending this hiring freeze to the Medical campus for all positions except those deemed mission-critical by the UHealth Joint Operations Leadership Team (JOLT). The hiring freeze does not apply to budgeted student worker positions or those fully funded through grants.

Additional expense reductions
All budget centers, including colleges, schools, and administrative/operational departments will continue to significantly reduce or eliminate travel, entertainment, outside services, consulting, conferences, meetings, and other expenses.

Capital projects on hold
Capital projects that are already under construction, such as Lakeside Village, will continue. However, we have postponed nearly every other capital expenditure until further notice.

Furloughs and layoffs
We are considering every option possible to avoid furloughs and layoffs; however, a reduction in workforce may become unavoidable. I value the talent, commitment, and ingenuity our employees bring to the U every day, and one of our aims is to avoid across-the-board actions that would challenge family budgets or contribute to the current unemployment crisis. We will conduct a careful analysis of potential furloughs and layoffs through the lens of efficiency gains and protection of revenue streams. We will use every instrument at our disposal to support any affected employees.

Remote work practices
We continue to support work-at-home arrangements during the pandemic and are extending the University’s temporary COVID-19 policies and pay provisions as outlined in the communication sent by Human Resources last week. We will continually assess these policies and communicate changes, taking the reality families are facing as a result of COVID-19 into account.

Maximizing funding sources
Our Government Relations team continues to evaluate and urgently take action on funding opportunities available to health care systems and institutions of higher education through the CARES Act and other government programs. The team communicates frequently with local, state, and federal representatives to advocate on behalf of the U on a wide range of issues impacting our community, including higher education policy, health care, immigration policy, and scientific research.

The next few months will provide greater clarity, as we quantify our fall enrollment and further assess the financial impact of COVID-19 on the UHealth system. We will continue to reassess and keep you informed along the way.

The path forward
COVID-19 has taken many thousands of lives, hundreds right here in our community. Compounding that loss, we are facing a significant economic disruption. We are mindful of those who have lost loved ones or who face a long road to recovery. Let me assure you—there is a path forward, and I firmly believe that as a University and as an academic health system it is our responsibility to lead by example.

What does this mean? It means that we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of the University of Miami community.

It means that we will protect our core mission—education, research, innovation, service, and patient care—because the world needs us now more than ever before.

It means that we will make decisions through the lens of transparency, belonging, and inclusion, because We Are One U.

I know that this has been a challenging, isolating, and, for some, frightening time period. I also know that ’Canes are up to any challenge and can be counted on to support one another. Thank you all for the ways you are stepping up, and lifting one another up, especially our brave clinical colleagues working on the front lines. As I shared with our clinical chairs recently, our institution is not an abstraction; it is not a series of buildings and courses and programs. It is brought to life and given its meaning by each of us working together toward the mission that is our “why”: our reason for being one U.

Times of crisis offer opportunities for transformation. Together, we will build a better normal, with our values as its intact foundation. I am confident that we will arrive on the other side of this crisis with a renewed sense of purpose rooted in the resilience that has distinguished the University of Miami for 95 years—and will always be at our core.",1269,fl,4

We recognize the financial strain faced by many of our students and their families during this period of unprecedented disruption. To help alleviate some of these concerns and to support our students, the University is providing financial relief in a number of ways.

Refund of unused fees
The University will refund student accounts with a prorated amount for any Spring 2020 fees and services that cannot be provided in an online or virtual format. This includes housing, dining, parking, student center, wellness center, health and counseling, student activities, and athletics fees. Fees will be prorated to March when classes transitioned to an online format. Services that remain available to students, such as health and counseling services for Florida residents through telehealth, will not be refunded. Prorated refunds will be posted to the student account on April 28 and can be viewed in ’CaneLink. Specific questions may be directed to the dedicated ’Canes Central team.

Federal Work Study and non-Federal Work Study income
The Department of Education authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The University has and will continue to pay hourly Federal Work Study and non-Federal Work Study student employees through the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Detailed information has been provided to eligible students.

Support for students experiencing serious financial hardship
Students experiencing serious financial hardship are encouraged to submit to ’Canes Central a request for review of your financial aid arrangements to determine if you are eligible for an increase in aid or if emergency support may be available from another source.

The unity of our Hurricanes family in the face of this pandemic—working together to support one another and to ensure the continuity of education, research, and patient care—has been inspiring. Supporting our students’ academic pursuits continues to be at the forefront of our efforts, and the well-being of our community remains our highest priority. We look forward to a successful summer term, and to an anticipated on-time, on-campus start to our fall semester.

Sincerely,

Miami,06-May-2020,"Dear Students,

As the University closes the spring semester while planning for the months ahead, we write to share an update regarding emergency financial assistance for students.

Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the University will receive and distribute funds to University of Miami students who have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These emergency funds will be distributed to students who have incurred expenses due to the disruption of campus operations, including eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care.

The Department of Education has issued guidelines regarding the eligibility of students who may receive emergency financial aid grants under the CARES Act:

    Must have completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA) for the 2019-20 or 2020-21 academic years; students who have not filed a FAFSA but are eligible to do so may also be eligible to receive emergency financial aid grants under the act
    Must meet federal Satisfactory Academic Progress standards
    Must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident

Under the federal guidelines, students who were exclusively in an online program prior to the disruption of campus operations are not eligible to receive these federal funds.

If you believe you are eligible for an emergency grant based on the Department of Education guidelines, please complete a brief online applicationto request emergency financial assistance. The ’Canes Central FAQs answer additional questions about student eligibility, eligible expenses, and the application process.

Funding is limited and it is our aim to assist those students in the greatest need. To expedite the distribution of emergency funds to students, the University will review applications and award funds on an ongoing basis until the funds are exhausted. Forms must be submitted by Wednesday, May 13, at 5 p.m., and the completion of the request form does not guarantee funding. Students will be notified of a decision via their miami.edu email account.

For additional information, please visit canescentral.miami.edu to submit your question. A ’Canes Central associate will then follow up with you directly.",346,fl,5
Miami,15-May-2020,"To the University of Miami Community,

On May 13, Miami-Dade County released “The New Normal” plan, which provides guidance for the phased reopening of Miami-Dade County beginning Monday, May 18, 2020; other local municipalities are beginning to release their reopening plans.

The University will review all plans that may impact our various campuses and community members, and will communicate any changes to our operations in advance. At this time, the University is not making any significant changes to its operations.

The following summarizes near-term guidance on University operations:


There are no changes to current remote work guidelines.

    Staff who are able to work remotely on all campuses should continue to do so until further notice. Plans continue for a phased reopening of the Coral Gables and Marine campuses in preparation for a safe resumption of classes in the fall. These plans will balance the needs of on-site activities with a continued need to limit density on all campuses for the foreseeable future.
    UHealth staff working in clinical services should continue to follow previously communicated reactivation plans, and stay informed about medical campus and health system operations on the my.med.miami.edu website.

 

The University will continue existing health and safety measures on all campuses.

For the Coral Gables and Marine campuses, the Facilities Operations and Planning team is working with University departments—academic and administrative—to plan for the safe restart of on-campus classes in the fall through the work of seven multi-disciplinary committees. The safety measures underway include:

    Adding hand sanitizer stations at every building entrance and throughout high-traffic interior spaces
    Installing additional disinfecting wipe stations throughout campuses
    Posting signs to remind individuals of physical distancing guidelines and proper hygiene practices
    Deploying wellness (plexiglass) shields at points of sale, office entry, select labs, and information desks
    Conducting deep cleaning of all campus spaces regularly with enhanced protocols and increased frequency
    Maintaining inventories of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies
    Procuring face coverings to distribute to every student, faculty, and staff member upon return to campus

The medical school and health system continue health and safety practices with the reactivation of key clinical services.


There are no changes to virtual learning plans during the summer or the intent to safely resume on-campus classes in the fall.

    All summer classes will continue to meet virtually and course schedules will not change.
    The University is exploring a broad range of available and emerging technology for COVID-19 screening, testing, and tracing that will support a safe campus environment in the fall.

 

The University of Miami community should continue to practice physical distancing, wear face coverings, and follow personal protective equipment guidelines as defined by local emergency orders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other regulatory guidelines.

    The order strongly urges individuals to wear face coverings inside businesses and commercial establishments wherever physical distancing is not possible.

 

The complete Miami-Dade County plan can be found here.

Safety has been and will continue to be the top priority when making decisions regarding a safe reopening, and you will be informed of any changes in advance. Additional measures and guidelines will be shared as they are developed.",519,fl,5
University of North Texas,18-May-2020,"Dear UNT community,

Denton County Public Health will be offering drive-thru COVID-19 testing at the Union Circle Garage, beginning Tuesday, May 19. The testing window is from 8 a.m. to noon and is scheduled for May 19 with additional campus testing dates slated for June.

Individuals must register by 5 p.m. today (Monday, May 18) in order to participate in tomorrow’s testing. Visit dentoncounty.gov/covid19testing for more information or to register.

UNT is proud to assist the DCPH Department in providing a location for the testing and thankful for the opportunity to do our part in supporting our community.",98,tex,5
University of North Texas,15-May-2020,"Final COVID-19 Regular Update

Today’s edition of the COVID-19 Update is the final one in this form. On Monday, you will receive the first issue of UNT Today, which will be distributed three days per week during the summer, then daily with the start of the new academic year in August. UNT Today will provide news, information about events, and other campus updates and announcements delivered to your inbox each morning.

News regarding opening campus

There are five committees charged with managing the re-entry/recovery process. The leads from each of those committees will meet once a week and will act as an advisory group to the President and Cabinet. In addition, each Vice President will provide more detailed information to their division about their specific re-entry plans within the UNT System and university-level guidance. The committees are: academics, research, student life, facilities and operations, and health and safety. Additional information will be shared as plans are developed and finalized.

UNT Professor Jean Keller in the Department of Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation and Tao Zhang, director of the Pediatric Movement and Physical Activity Laboratory, are participating in a collaborative research project with Scottish Rite for Children Hospital and several other local universities on the impact that social distancing and ""shelter-in-place"" has had on the activity levels of children across the U.S.

If you are caring for a child, please take a moment to complete this research survey, and share the survey with others via social media.

In an effort to keep our community as healthy as possible, UNT made the difficult decision to cancel all summer youth programs and camps that are offered on our campus and/or UNT programs hosted off-site. Our university is proud of the quality of the experiences our UNT summer camps provide to hundreds of youth every year, and we are saddened that we will not be able to welcome these young students and their families to our campus this summer.

f you coordinate one of the many youth summer camps, Nadia Guevara, Youth Protection Program director, will be reaching out with more information. You may email youthprotection@unt.edu for more information.

From Moe Elzonkoly, food service manager in the retail-dining department:

I would like to give a shout out to our full-time employees, especially our cooks, in the retail dining department AND in the residential dining department. Our full-time staff have been identified as essential and have worked hard to provide food for our staff and first responders while keeping them safe and happy. We are going above and beyond in all necessary areas – from cooking delicious food (OOOOHHH OUR FAMOUS MAC AND CHEESE) and sharing smiles to cleaning and sanitizing commonly used or touched areas.

Student Health and Wellness Center (SHWC) Update:

The SHWC is available for students for all appointment reasons, without restrictions, including Walk-In STD testing. The hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.
The SHWC has expanded its telemedicine visits with medical providers, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and the dietitian. Not all issues are appropriate for this type of visit, so call and check on specifics.
The SHWC has implemented new precautions to protect the health and safety of students and staff. One notable addition is a mobile nurse’s station on the first floor of Chestnut Hall to take patient temperatures and confirm students have some type of face covering before entering the reception area on the 2nd floor. All staff will be wearing either a cloth face covering or a mask and have their temperature monitored each day. We also have increased our already aggressive cleaning protocols for all areas and high-touch surfaces as well as installed several large sneeze guards throughout the clinic.
The SHWC Pharmacy is available for students and staff with regular hours and additional safety precautions mentioned above.
Most SHWC staff, minus a few administrative employees continuing to telecommute, are back in the clinic, ready to assist students with any healthcare related need.
The SHWC Meadows Center for Health Resources will remain closed for the immediate future.
When UNT’s Risk Management Services put out a call on campus for supplies for mask making efforts, departments generously responded by donating UNT bandanas and rally towels. Watch this video to see how the Wise Mask Makers, volunteer seamstresses from Wise County, are using the fabric to make more than 350 masks for the UNT community.

Don’t forget to follow the CDC’s recommendations and wear your cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 to keep yourself and others safe.

Dining and Retail Update:

Dining Services will keep this schedule through Sunday, May 24, and retail hours will remain unchanged through May 31. In addition, Kerr Dining Hall will be closed May 25-31. It will re-open June 1 for Summer 5W1 and plans are being made to re-open additional retail options as more faculty/staff return to campus.

Professor Krisstal Clayton in the Psychology Department at UNT is going above and beyond by providing wonderful resources to her students. She is there for us in these tough times, always willing to lend a listening ear or even a distraction for us if we are feeling too overwhelmed to talk about what is going on. Things are uneasy for all of us right now, even professors, who are also adjusting to changes to their teaching methods. When classes were taking place on campus, we would always look forward to Dr. Clayton’s class. Dr. Clayton always has made herself available to us not only as a professor, but also as a friend.

University of North Texas,11-May-2020,"Have you been wearing a cloth face cover? According to the CDC, those who lack symptoms of COVID-19 can still transmit the virus. To help protect those around you, the CDC recommends you wear a cloth face covering in public settings when social distancing is difficult to maintain.

If you do wear a cover, make sure you clean it frequently. Per the CDC, face covers may be washed in a washing machine and tumble dry low. Covers made out of delicate materials may be hand washed instead: to do this, knead the fabric with warm, soapy water and then rinse. Allow the cover to dry on a sanitized surface.

Jordan Williams, senior communications specialist in Lifelong Learning and Community Engagement, has gone above and beyond to help keep members for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) and the UNT Retiree Association both intellectually and socially engaged during the trying times of COVID-19.

Seniors are one of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to our current health crisis. Because of this, OLLI at UNT and UNTRA members are sheltering in place and not venturing out much at all. Jordan is keeping them intellectually stimulated by providing them with educational content that can be viewed from the safety of their own homes. He also is providing meaningful content through social media for them as well. He also has helped facilitate a Phone Pal program where OLLI at UNT Ambassadors call other members for friendly conversation. This program was created to help seniors who are feeling socially isolated.

Wendy Middlemiss, Ph.D., associate professor of Educational Psychology, wrote with the following recognition:

Our University and College of Education house the state office for the Home Instruction of Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY). HIPPY is a home visiting program providing families with activities helping at-risk children gain school readiness skills. Our state office oversees 11 program sites stretching from the DFW area to the Rio Grande Valley.

For Adriana Trevino, our director, and Janie Rojas, assistant director, the stay-at-home orders were met with an all-encompassing question: “What happens to a home visiting program when you can't visit a home?”

Since mid-March, as districts and agencies closed their doors, Adriana and Janie spent hour upon hour answering that question for each of the 11 unique sites, often working well into the evening hours. They helped sites initiate plans for virtual home visits or home visits by phone for communities with limited Internet access. Our directors helped sites assure that their AmeriCorps-member home visitors remained in active status, and thus continued earning both an income and their education awards.

For Adriana and Janie, efforts to meet these program needs often paled in the face of finding ways of relieving the anxiety and stress experienced in each community. It is only because of their tireless dedication and hard work that HIPPY continues to provide for children’s educational needs and family well-being across our state.

To achieve these positive outcomes, Adriana and Janie attended numerous webinars learning the ins and outs of both HIPPY and AmeriCorps expectations. As well, they helped submit a federal planning grant proposal [which received approval and funding just this week] to help the program meet changing needs. Their efforts and hopefulness represent UNT’s community spirit in this time of need.

Bridget O’Brien, assistant director of the Child Development Laboratory, would like to recognize Benjamin Hanisian for all of his hard work on the UNT Rec Sports “Keep Moving” Initiative. He is the assistant director of Departmental Marketing and Communications at Rec Sports and has done an excellent job migrating their fitness programs online and setting up their website to keep staff and students active, healthy, and involved; even from afar.

I feel he has gone above and beyond on this huge project, as he updates the site weekly with “Workout Plans of the Week,” which include a schedule of daily Zoom and YouTube Virtual Workout Classes (and even demonstration warm-up videos to watch beforehand!). He has made sure to post a variety of classes, times, and even suggestions for creative ways to adapt your workout at home, which is very inclusive and thoughtful of those with limited resources.

On top of this, he has an excellent social media presence on all platforms, including daily schedule reminders, motivational posts, and Instagram Live workouts.

His work on this project has given the university body a very comprehensive online fitness program that not only helps keep us active and motivated, but helps us feel connected to one another. This reliable, user-friendly resource has been very beneficial for me and many of my co-workers at UNT as we navigate working from home while trying to stay physically and mentally fit.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response

From Hepi Wachter, Ph.D., professor and chair in the Department of Design in the College of Visual Arts and Design:

I feel CVAD’s fashion design programis going above and beyond as we wrap up the semester. Professors Trippeer, Chang, Gam and Otto had a lot to “lift” transferring the fashion design senior show. (In the past, we would have enjoyed a fashion show in the Union.)

They have all been working hard to ensure student success, and in particular, aid our seniors to navigate what will obviously be a challenging transition into the industry.

Since restrictions were enacted during spring break and all senior fashion show exhibition opportunities were moved online, the fashion program was quick to enact their own form of the innovation imperative, and as such they have been strategically preparing our seniors to enter the workforce and get their materials out into the public without “running the show.”

As of April 22, each fashion design senior has not only completed a full digital online web-based portfolio, but also set up full LinkedIn profiles that are actively being used to engage with the fashion design industry. In lieu of the mounted show, they are developing it on www.untfashiondesigngrads.com by mid-May.

After weeks of intensive training through mock interview sessions, both in one-on-one sessions and through peers as small groups, the students are now “ready” to test their materials and solicit additional industry feedback.

As of last week, every single student has completed at least one information interview (and perhaps a few more) through our industry alumni network, and associated industry contact list.

We have also done thorough training on how to maximize key job search engines which exist in open source format (such as LinkedIn networking and Google Grow’s new job search platform), as well as other primary sources for industry networking (WWD, BOF, Fashion United, and StykeCareers).

Rather serendipitously, this unique moment and perhaps positive fallout of COVID-19 has allowed us to put more stress on these modes of delivery, which are often used as communication platforms, and based on current restrictions, will continue to become key survival skills. We believe they will become part of the “new-normal.”

I would like to bring to your attention my supervisor, Raylon Dukes. Ever since the sent-home order was put into place, he has been coming to campus and still doing his daily duties instead of working from home, covering every issue that popped up in the field. He has kept us updated as well as the student workers who are still here and checks on those that have chosen to go home abroad. Raylon is very caring and giving. He would give you the shirt off his back. He always makes sure everyone around him is always ok, by keeping us supplied with masks and sanitizer. He is definitely the backbone of this department. I am proud to be his lead. He has taught me so much. He is a great mentor to us all. He is the T in TEAM. He is not one for praise, so he would credit us for the success we share here in Auxiliary HVAC, but it is because of his heart and caring for his people that we succeed.

During this time, we have all been adapting to virtual services, remote and online classes, and shelter in place. I hope you are doing well, that you are staying safe and healthy, and are making progress. Like me, I suspect you are looking forward to being together again to live, learn, and enjoy our rich campus experience.

Our leadership teams have been working hard to help us begin the transition from remote learning back to more normal campus operations. Today, I want to inform you that we plan to begin limited in-person teaching as early as Summer II and are planning on safely resuming campus learning and residential life for Fall 2020.

As we plan for our return to campus, the new normal will be different. Your safety is our top priority, and we will take every precaution to keep our community safe in this new world. We are assessing options and precautions for eventually returning to campus for all in-person activities and programs, ranging from lab-based research to general instruction and the undergraduate residential experience. Of course, these plans depend on continuing improvement in COVID-19 cases, and guidance from federal, state, and local health authorities to ensure your safety. We will be communicating in the coming weeks about what exactly you can expect when you return to campus.

This global health crisis also has had a financial impact on all of us. I want you to know if you need help of any kind you can get access to our many services at the Start Green Stay Green website (https://www.unt.edu/staygreen). We are here for you through these challenging times. Many of you have been hit hard by the current economy, and we are doing our best to balance easing financial burdens with providing the top quality UNT education and experience you deserve. If you are experiencing financial insecurity, please apply for assistance from our emergency grants-in-aid program available through the CARES Act. These funds are available now and are meant to help you pay your bills so you can stay in school and earn your degree as planned. Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA.

Despite the many weeks apart, we have become an even stronger, more connected UNT community through this shared adversity. I hope someday we look back at this time and see not just the challenges, but also the love and care we gave one another. We will emerge from this global health crisis stronger and more united as the Mean Green Family than ever before.

University of North Texas,29-Apr-2020,"Have you been wearing a cloth face cover? According to the CDC, those who lack symptoms of COVID-19 can still transmit the virus. To help protect those around you, the CDC recommends you wear a cloth face covering in public settings when social distancing is difficult to maintain.

If you do wear a cover, make sure you clean it frequently. Per the CDC, face covers may be washed in a washing machine and tumble dry low. Covers made out of delicate materials may be hand washed instead: to do this, knead the fabric with warm, soapy water and then rinse. Allow the cover to dry on a sanitized surface.

President Smatresk will be hosting a virtual Town Hall from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Monday, May 4, in order to share campus updates and answer questions.

You can watch and submit questions during the Town Hall by clicking here Monday. The president will share information about what to expect as the university works toward bringing us back together on campus, as well as talk about what is working well right now and what faculty, staff and students need help with to keep us moving forward.

From April 24 to May 22, members of the Mean Green Family will join Muslims around the world in observance of Ramadan. Among the highest of holy observances for Islam, Ramadan occurs during the ninth month of the Lunar calendar and requires observers to refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset as a path to spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship.

While our students move into exams next week, please be mindful that some may be fasting and experiencing dehydration, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Read more about Ramadan here.

Paul Goebel, director of the UNT Student Money Management Center, applauds the efforts of Mohammad ‘Mo’ Osman and the SMMC Outreach Team. When Osman received notification that the campus was closing, he took it upon himself to convert one of the center’s most popular classroom-based programs — Financial Intelligence Training — to an online version accessible through Canvas. FIT is a three-part series that helps students strengthen their foundational money management skills. More than 130 students have registered for the Canvas-based program.

Goebel says the outreach team has worked incessantly over the past weeks to develop, design and introduce new online and virtual educational programs for students while the campus is closed. The team is currently made up solely of students. “It’s wonderful to witness their creativity and outside-the-box can-do attitude in action,” he says.

Be Mean Green Ready for severe weather at UNT

Severe weather can occur at any time of the year, but the North Texas region sees a more significant threat during spring months. Preparation for storms, tornados and other severe weather is key. Below are some tips to help the UNT community become Mean Green Ready for severe weather!

Update your Eagle Alert information

All UNT community members are automatically enrolled in the emergency messaging system for campus, Eagle Alert, but can choose the best emails or telephone numbers for contact information. UNT System staff are automatically signed up to receive Eagle Alerts based on their office location and can choose to receive alerts from other UNT System locations if they would like to do so. Keep Eagle Alert information up to date at my.unt.edu (students and faculty) or my.untsystem.edu (staff). Also follow @UNTEagleAlert on Twitter to get up to date information.

Be 'Weather Aware' at all times

Check on weather conditions and understand weather impacts. When severe weather is in the forecast, keep an eye on the weather through the National Weather Service or by following Emergency Management and Safety Services on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Know where to go

Identify the nearest shelter areas. Shelter areas are designated for every building on campus and can be viewed at UNT Emergency Floor Plans or via the UNT Mean Green Ready App.

Understand the difference between a watch and a warning

A watch means that conditions are favorable for a particular type of weather. A warning means that the weather event is under way. Here are some common severe weather terms:

Severe thunderstorm watch: A severe thunderstorm is possible. Be weather aware and stay tuned to local radio/TV for information.
Severe thunderstorm warning: A severe thunderstorm is happening or imminent. Get indoors immediately and stay tuned to local radio/TV for more information.
Tornado watch: A tornado is possible. Know where you’ll take shelter if you have to. Be weather aware and stay tuned to local radio/TV for information.
Tornado warning: A tornado is happening or imminent. Take shelter immediately and stay in your shelter until the warning has ended.
Learn what to do and about available resources

Visit UNT Emergency Management and NWS Weather Safety for more information about severe weather and the tools available to help with preparedness efforts. Visit KnoWhat2Do to make an emergency plan. Follow UNT Emergency Management (@MeanGreenReady) on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for the most up-to-date safety and weather information for UNT Denton, Discovery Park, and the New College at Frisco.

Take an emergency readiness training class, provided by Emergency Management and Safety Services and the UNT Police Department. Fill out a training request form to learn more about this valuable training.

University of North Texas,15-Apr-2020,"In tracking time during the current health situation, UNT System HR has found that some employees without the ability to telecommute or work are not entering emergency leave, and the time is reflecting as regular hours worked.

Any staff member:

whose job is not conducive to telecommuting;

has no alternative duties assigned

She kept track of many things, from equipment requests to remote teaching forms, time reporting and more. Kristi also mixed together her own cleaning materials when we weren't able to buy it anymore. As the last woman standing in an otherwise deserted department, she even delivered teaching equipment and other items to people — or met them in the Walmart parking lot — after work! She traveled as far as Keller to make sure all employees had what they needed to succeed remotely. Above all, Nelson kept her colleagues’ spirits up with some great office humor. “The list goes on, but we are just so thrilled to share the type of employees we have working here at UNT,” says Jana Watkins, office manager and assistant to the chair. “Math rocks!

University of North Texas,15-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT students,

As educators, our purpose is you. We spend every day focused on helping each of you thrive, and we revel in your creativity, tenacity and brilliance. Our world has been shaken and that calls for a change in how we support you. We recognize that one of the biggest burdens many students are facing right now is financial insecurity. In an effort to ease some of the economic strain you may be experiencing, I want to let you know how UNT is trying to help.

First, we have made changes to the cost of enrolling in summer courses. For summer 2020 sessions, students will not have to pay some of the typical mandatory fees that help fund several support services on campus. This includes waivers of the Recreational Facility Fee, Student Union Fee, Medical Services Fee, Transportation Fee and Athletics Fee. We are able to do this because we have moved all in-person classes scheduled for the May session, Summer I and full summer sessions to online/remote delivery. Students can take advantage of these summer sessions and reduced costs to save money and stay on track to graduate on time.

Second, as you may already be aware, the federal government has provided a boost in student aid through the CARES Act. This funding allows us to greatly expand our emergency grants-in-aid program. This need-based aid is available for currently enrolled students as well as students who enroll in UNT summer sessions. The funds are intended to help students pay their bills and stay in school so they can earn their degrees as planned.

Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA. And, you can learn more about the cost of summer sessions by contacting Student Financial Services at sfs@unt.edu, online chat at sfs.unt.edu or by calling 940-565-3225.

I realize that emergency aid and fee waivers won't solve every problem. Times are tough, but so is our Mean Green Family. We will keep working on creative solutions to unprecedented problems. We will keep finding fresh ways to bring you the world-class education you deserve. You won't have to make it through these tough times alone. We're here to help you thrive because that's what we do.

I hope you are all doing well as we continue to innovate and break new ground to promote our students’ success during this challenging time. I appreciate the resilience we have shown as a community — it exemplifies our Mean Green spirit!

Van Cross of the Facilities Custodial Team works a tough schedule: Way, way before sunrise until lunchtime. He’s been working during the pandemic to sanitize campus buildings, stock restrooms and accomplish small cleaning projects taking advantage of the vacant buildings across UNT.

One recent morning, while preparing for a special cleaning project, he heard dripping water in the Environmental Education, Science and Technology Building and discovered a failed research system pumping water into the building. Mr. Cross notified a stand-by technician to get the leak stopped, contacted his supervisor and manager to rally a team to assist and began gathering and using water extraction equipment.

Van’s attentiveness and quick response saved “many thousands of dollars in clean-up and restoration costs,” according to Randy Salsman of the Facilities Maintenance construction team that is overseeing the recovery and repairs to the building. Associate Vice President of Facilities Dave Reynolds says, “Van Cross is representative of many of the Facilities Team and others across the campus who are unselfishly taking care of our campus and students during a unique time in history.

Sophilia McTyre, assistant director of TRIO Talent Search, commends Daniel Griffith from AITS for the many years he has supported UNT’s TRIO programs. During these changing times, Danny has worked tirelessly to serve and exceed TRIO’s program needs. Not only did he meet with everyone on an individual basis to ensure that their home office technology needs were met, but he also assisted staff in customizing their many devices to meet their specific needs. During the many phone calls and sessions, he provided stellar service and always maintained a positive attitude. McTyre says, “I know my fellow team members would more than agree that Danny deserves recognition for being our Tech Hero.”

University of North Texas,2-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT students:

Many of you have expressed a desire to have Pass/No Pass options for all Spring 2020 undergraduate courses. I appreciate you taking the time to share your feelings with us, as well as your patience while we worked through the logistics. For your benefit, we have made the following changes applicable to Spring 2020 undergraduate courses:

Undergraduate students can choose either the university’s regular A-F grading scheme or Pass/No Pass for Spring 2020 courses on their academic record.
Students earning grades A-C will have these grades posted to their record at the time of grading. A student can elect to change their A-C grades to a Pass after grades post.
Students earning a grade of D or F will have a grade of No Pass entered by a faculty member, unless the student notifies their instructor otherwise before grading. Students can elect to change the No Pass grade back to the D or F after grades post.
Students can make different choices for different classes, choosing to keep some letter grades, and choosing others to remain Pass/No Pass.
Letter grades will continue to calculate in a student’s grade point average. Pass and No Pass options do not calculate in grade point averages.
Students will have until 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 14, to select a change to Pass for letter grades and to change No Pass grades back to a D or F based on the grade earned.
For graduate students, each graduate program is prepared to provide flexibility, as appropriate, to support student success.

To learn more about the Pass/No Pass Option, visit https://registrar.unt.edu/grades. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisor prior to making any grade election decisions.

I hope these changes bring relief to some of the stress you are feeling. I know life is filled with uncertainty right now. Many of us are worried about our health, our loved ones and our finances. But some things always hold strong and true: the knowledge you gain and the Mean Green threads tying each of us tightly together. We help one another. We listen to one another. You are never walking alone. We are, and always will be, a family.

University of North Texas,2-Apr-2020,"Campus officials have been notified of two additional, confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UNT.

One of the cases involves a staff member, who has no interaction with students and very little interaction with other university staff. It has been approximately 10 days since the individual last worked on campus, and any potential impacted parties have been notified.

The other case is a UNT student living alone in off-campus housing who has not been on campus since mid-March. The student already has completed the mandatory self-isolation and any potential impacted parties have been notified.

It is very important to follow the guidelines set forth by Denton County’s shelter-at-home order. Students living in residence halls must comply. The order only allows them to leave for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, picking up meals from campus dining, visiting a healthcare professional, or engaging in outdoor activity such as walking, hiking, running or riding a bicycle – with proper social distancing.

UNT officials have received reports of reduced service levels with some online platforms such as Zoom as more organizations worldwide reduce in-person meetings. Stories include having trouble with being kicked out of Zoom meetings or experiencing audio or video issues.

CIO Chris McCoy suggests turning off your VPN if you are using a UNT laptop and minimizing the number of applications running in the background. Zoom uses a considerable amount of memory, and open apps can result in processing issues. Since Zoom is a cloud service, VPN video data is encrypted and routed through campus firewalls before being sent unencrypted back out onto the internet to the Zoom servers. By turning VPN off, computers off campus are communicating directly with the Zoom servers without being routed through the campus.

Finally, when you run Zoom on an iPad, it is only running Zoom, not multiple apps.

University of North Texas,2-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT family,

There is no handbook for handling a global pandemic. There is no guide for navigating a world flipped upside down and inside out. We are human and with that humanity comes anxiety, vulnerability, fears, stress and selfishness. But when I look at our UNT community, those are not the traits I see. We are strong, resilient, brave, determined, creative, unified and selfless. Our Mean Green family was made to tackle times exactly like these.

I want to take a moment to share with you some of the examples of hope I’ve seen from our community in recent weeks. With less than two months remaining in the semester, our faculty halted their entire worlds and reimagined nearly 8,000 courses to find creative solutions to very unique problems. Our faculty stepped into the discomfort of the unknown because being there for our students who need to finish the semester successfully is more important. None of these herculean efforts would be possible without the support staff across the university, many of whom are tackling a variety of issues to keep our university going for our students and our community — and most are doing this from their own newly adapted home office environments. None of these changes have been simple or easy, but every single issue we’ve addressed has been to help our students succeed.

To all UNT students, you inspire us every day. You are the reason we continue moving forward. You, too, have hurdled countless obstacles and adapted to an ever-changing reality while admirably managing many stressors. You have done so with fearless spirit. Keep going. We are ready to help you climb mountains. You need only ask.

We also have hundreds of students who continue to call our campus residence halls home. To the staff who are caring for those students, feeding and housing them, protecting them, you are the epitome of the community values we hold dear. To the students, we remain sensitive to the toll this unprecedented crisis is having on you who are having to adjust not only in your learning but in many cases now are unable to work or be with your families. If you would like to show your support during these challenging times, we’ve established a special fund to help our students with immediate and pressing needs.

Our values also are evident among our alumni, who are proving that we truly are all Eagles for life. Once again, “Mattress Mack” Jim McIngvale is providing for the Houston community — this time by distributing meals to children and seniors. Lecrae has joined forces with the organization Love Beyond Walls to set up handwashing stations in Atlanta for the homeless; and fashion designer Khanh Nguyen has taken fabric she normally uses for her stunning wedding gowns to sew masks for health care professionals in Dallas.

You can read more about our alumni and some of their amazing efforts in supporting others during this crisis, as well as take time to read about university happenings in the spring issue of the North Texan magazine online. You also can find inspirational stories about our faculty, staff and students here. We will continue to post more of these online as we collect them and encourage all of you to share with us how you or someone you know has been making a difference during this time.

I continue to be amazed every day by the support, resilience and ingenuity displayed by our students, staff, faculty and alumni when every hour seems to bring more change and more necessary adaptations. Continue to care for one another. Continue to help each other through these challenges. As difficult as it may feel in this moment, we are becoming a stronger, more connected community through this shared experience. Let’s stay together in spirit and unity of purpose as the Mean Green family I am so very proud to call my own.

Neal Smatresk

University of North Texas,1-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT Students,

I know that the COVID-19 outbreak is impacting you deeply, and I hope you are doing well as we find new ways to support your progress. I hope you are all staying safe and are doing your best to take care of each other and your families.

Those of you who rely on income from campus jobs have expressed your concerns over whether we will be able to provide you with financial assistance. The short answer is we will provide support to all student workers who were employed in the week before spring break, but have been unable to return to work because of the pandemic.

You will be paid 20 hours per week for the first two weeks of April. This paycheck will come to you in the same manner in which you received your most recent paycheck; either via direct deposit or mail, on May 1. We want to help you be successful and will continue to look for resources for students who have critical needs.

In the interim, please be aware the UNT Career Center has created a central repository to match students in need of hours with units across the university with available work. The Career Center also is helping match students with part-time employment in the community, when possible. We also asked departments to stop hiring new student employees until we find work for our displaced students. Finally, there also are resources from the City of Denton for those seeking employment.

Please know that even if you don’t have hours now, you still could have a campus position when the university is fully operational again – pending approval from your supervisor. We encourage you to reach out to your direct supervisor with specific questions regarding your position and contact the Career Center for general questions and guidance.

If you are facing financial hardship due to this crisis, contact the Student Money Management Center, Dean of Students Office and Student Legal Services to be connected with resources. UNT’s Start Green Stay Green program also is a resource for students seeking options for financial assistance.

They’re seeing patients every single day from check-in to check-out, caring for students, calming fears and anxieties, treating illnesses and injuries — all while trying to keep themselves safe.

Other new duties include calling the long list of students, staff and faculty who have traveled or reported showing symptoms to make sure our UNT community stays as safe and healthy as possible, as well as developing telemedicine procedures (including telepsychiatry) to serve students who can’t or shouldn’t physically come into the clinic. Fields-Hawkins is fortunate enough to be able to do much of her job from home, but many of her coworkers are in the clinic right now making sure our students get the care they need. SHWC staff risk putting their health and the health of their families on the line because of their dedication to our students – their patients.

“We wouldn’t exist without our patients, so we’re not going to let them down when they need us,” Fields-Hawkins says. “The UNT community is home, and we will always stand with our family.”

Ralf joined our department only this past fall from another institution, but he very quickly earned the trust of our faculty, staff and graduate students and, before the “coronacrisis” hit, had already started transforming the department in a positive way. But these last few weeks, his calm and steady leadership has truly made a difference. Day by day, he kept everyone informed with clear emails detailing step by step what we needed to do next, sometimes even with a measured dose of humor. He also constructed a webpage with helpful tips for teaching online. Moreover, he went out of his way to ensure that all instructional personnel had the necessary resources to start teaching online, ordering tablets, webcams and document cameras for whoever needed them, and with his physical presence he kept up morale among the staff who had to keep coming into the office until the very last moment when the department was already a ghost town. Thanks to Ralf's leadership, the Mathematics Department experienced a remarkably smooth transition.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response:

From Frances Perkins, principal lecturer and department advisor, Department of Media Arts:

The staff in the Media Arts department have gone above and beyond since the first moments of this unusual situation. They have been present in person while the faculty and adjuncts have been able to work remotely, handling student workers, keeping all operations going (including the TV and radio stations), and then having to shut down the department physically by yesterday afternoon. This included cleaning out refrigerators and planning how mail would be delivered. All of this happened during the retirement of one staff member and the change of department chairs. Our staff have been on the front line, so to speak, and we the faculty of the Media Arts department cannot express enough our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

Our amazing staff include:

Mark Dobson – Media Technical Manager
Martin Dzurenko – Chief Engineer TV
Laura Flowers – CLASS Undergraduate Advisor
Mark Lambert – KNTU Station Manager

University of North Texas,25-Mar-2020,"Dear Mean Green students and parents,

On Tuesday, officials from Denton County and the City of Denton announced a ""stay-at-home"" order beginning at 11:59 p.m. today, Wednesday, March 25. UNT already had announced a campus transition to essential operations only, which began at 5 p.m. yesterday, March 24.

We must all take this ""stay-at-home"" order to heart. It is essential for the health and safety of our community that we reduce our population density to slow the spread of this virus.

Students living in residence halls must comply with the ""stay-at-home"" order. The order allows students to leave their residence only for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, picking up meals from campus dining, visiting a healthcare professional, or engaging in outdoor activity such as walking, hiking, running or riding a bicycle – with proper social distancing.

We understand that for some students, UNT is their home and, as such, we have an added responsibility to ensure their health and safety on our campus. We will continue to maintain specific, essential, on-campus services for students who need them, including:

Meal service for our on-campus residents will be provided with to-go options from Kerr Cafeteria.
The Union is closed with the exception of Eagle Post, which is open 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
For students feeling anxiety or stress, Counseling Services remain available.
Willis Library will remain open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for UNT faculty, staff and students with UNT ID. Many UNT Library services also are available.
The Student Health and Wellness Center will maintain regular hours with the exception of a noon to 1 p.m. daily closure for lunch.
The Food pantry is closed. Please reach out to the Denton Community Food Center for assistance.
All other university services, and campus access for non-campus residents, have moved to virtual service only.
We are in uncharted territory as we face this global pandemic together. I am amazed every day by the support, resilience and ingenuity displayed by our students, staff and faculty when every hour seems to bring more change, more necessary adaptations, and more uncertainty.

As difficult as it may feel in this moment, we are becoming a stronger, more connected community through this shared experience. Someday soon we will be together again to live, learn and play. Until then, stay together in spirit and unity of purpose as the Mean Green family I am so very proud to call my own.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response

UNT student Kelly Schmidt wants to give a shout out to her supervisor, Brecken Wellborn, at the Learning Center. Kelly wrote the following:

“He is the director of Tutoring Services and has been working overtime to keep all his student employees connected, safe, and up-to-date during this scary time. Transitioning all of the Learning Center's tutoring services to online offerings in the space of a week and coordinating the changing schedules of 10 different tutors and their appointments was a huge task, but he has managed it amazingly well. I think all of my fellow employees would agree that he goes above and beyond for UNT and for us, and that he deserves some recognition.”

If you know of someone who is going above and beyond, please share their information with untpresident@unt.edu so we can give them a shout out.

The campus will transition to only essential operations and we will move all other campus offices to virtual service delivery by 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, March 24.

UNT employees who do not fall into the essential personnel category for being on campus and are unable to do their work from home – as determined by your vice president and supervisor – will be reassigned to other duties or receive emergency leave through Friday, April 3.

University of North Texas,20-Mar-2020,"Dear Mean Green family,

We are living through an unprecedented global event the likes of which we have rarely seen in the 130-year history of our university. The personal impact on each of us and our normal routine on and off campus is great, which is why I am writing to share news about Commencement with you today.

After much consideration, I have decided to postpone Commencement ceremonies that were scheduled for May 7-10. Our spring commencement is the last major event to be impacted, and the decision was not made quickly in order to thoroughly consider whether we could begin returning to normal operations in early May. While we should all remain optimistic about where we could be with the fight against coronavirus (COVID-19) in 45 days, families of May graduates need to know now whether to make travel arrangements.

I know that crossing the stage is a defining moment for our students who have worked so hard to earn their degree(s), so please know that many people across campus are currently reviewing ways to still allow commencement to happen later in the year for any graduate wishing to participate. Whatever is decided, spring graduates will have an opportunity to participate in an in-person ceremony and cross the stage at a commencement ceremony, but you will officially graduate regardless of whether we hold a ceremony or not. As soon as we make a decision regarding these later ceremony options, we will share that information with our community.

For students who still need answers regarding our transition to online instruction, including such topics as the availability of laptops and textbooks, please visit our frequently asked questions page on the healthalerts.unt.edu website.

Thank you for your patience as we work together to allow our students to complete the current semester over the coming weeks.

University of North Texas,19-Mar-2020,"Dear UNT community members,

Amid growing concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19 infections across the world and the United States, there has been an increase in the number of reports regarding stereotyping, harassment, and bullying directed toward students and faculty perceived to be of Chinese-American or, more generally, Asian descent. It is important for us to pause for a moment and consider how our thoughts, our words, and our actions influence others in our community who are equally affected by this global health crisis.

As we all know, words can hurt, and can substantially interfere with our students' educational access and our employees’ work opportunities. UNT will not tolerate harassing behavior toward our community members who are or may appear to be of Asian descent. Let me be clear when I state that this is not who we are as a community.

As we move into online instruction, we expect UNT students, faculty, staff, and administrators to refrain from any identity-based jokes, slurs, harassment, or exclusion against any member of the Mean Green Family. The UNT policy on “Prohibition of Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation” is still in effect despite these new ways of learning and working and will be enforced. Should you experience or witness a violation of this policy committed by a student, we encourage you to report it to the Dean of Students Office at report.unt.edu. Suspected violations committed by faculty or staff members should be reported to Equal Opportunity.

Now more than ever, it's important that we live our mission and our values: to be a caring community that creates and maintains an inclusive and equitable learning and working environment for collaborative educational innovation. In this time of crisis, it is essential that we are ever more vigilant in our commitment to these values.

UNT remains committed to being a caring community for all its students and employees and committed to building a world where all of humanity is treated with dignity and respect.

UNT officials have received reports of reduced service levels with some online platforms such as Zoom as more organizations worldwide reduce in-person meetings, instruction, etc. Since the issue is not with university-delivered services, there is very little that can be done to remedy the issue. However, alternate ways of conducting meetings and classes is always a consideration, and information will be relayed as it becomes available.

Vendors are adjusting their capacity to meet global demand, but home Internet services may also experience congestion due to increased demand. We expect demand to level off as people adjust to working from home.

UNT Police would like the campus community to know that police services will not be reduced. An online reporting option is available athttps://police.unt.edu/reportcrime. Community members can also make a report or speak to an officer by telephone by calling 940-565-3003. All emergencies should continue to be reported by calling 911.

All remaining, university-sponsored, in-person events on campus are canceled effective immediately. No decision has been made regarding May Commencement ceremonies.
In-person meetings should follow current federal guidelines. If possible, all, or a majority, of participants should use Zoom, conference calls or another alternative form of communication.
In consultation with division vice presidents, supervisors should finalize plans for employees to telecommute, where possible, and increase rotation of staff on and off campus in situations where some staff are needed on-site for business continuity.  
As quickly as possible, we are moving to mostly electronic approvals to replace paper forms that often travel through multiple individuals.

There are no confirmed cases at UNT or in Denton County at this time, but we have seen reported cases in Collin, Dallas and Tarrant counties over the past week. As a result, we are taking the following steps to protect our campus community:

UNT will cancel all in-person classes at all locations for the week of March 16-22, as the university transitions to online or alternative instructional delivery.
Online classes and field experiences will continue as normal the week of March 16-22.
All instruction will resume on Monday, March 23.

In addition, we are taking these precautions involving travel and events: 

We are suspending university-sponsored international travel until further notice.
Only domestic travel necessary for essential business continuity will be supported until further notice. Guidelines for essential business continuity travel will be established by the Vice Presidents of each area. 
Faculty, staff or students returning from countries with travel restrictions or visiting our campus from a country with travel restrictions will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days, with monitoring provided by our Student Health and Wellness Center.
We ask all employees and students returning from personal international travel or highly impacted areas domestically to please report their trip to international risk control at 940-369-6154 for further guidance.
Beginning March 23, events with more than 250 people that don’t affect business continuity will be canceled or postponed.
As you make decisions about returning to campus, please consider the CDC’s criteria for people considered to be at higher risk, including older adults and people with chronic medical conditions.

University of North Texas,4-Mar-2020,"With significant media coverage and global conversation devoted to Coronavirus 19, we want to provide our community with educational resources for public health and safety concerns. It should be noted that the flu is still a far bigger concern in the U.S. According to the CDC, the immediate health risk for COVID-19 to the general U.S. public, who are unlikely to be exposed to the virus at this time, is still considered low.

As spring break approaches, members of the UNT community are encouraged to be mindful of CDC and U.S. Department of State advice when considering travel plans. Travel restrictions and advisories can change frequently, and travelers should be prepared for restrictions going into effect with little or no advance notice. UNT’s International Travel Team can help you with travel insurance or the latest information about areas where you’ll be traveling.

The UNT public health and emergency preparedness staff regularly keep in contact with government public health officials to stay updated on the latest public health information. This campus-wide committee consistently monitors ongoing concerns to ensure the university is prepared, as well as to provide information and assist our university community should the need arise.

Below are everyday actions we can all take to help prevent the spread of any respiratory virus:

USF,27-Jan-2020,"JANUARY 27, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF students, faculty and staff, If you have been paying attention to world news lately you may have heard about coronavirus emerging in China, with some confirmed cases outside of China (including one in Washington state) linked to travelers. While the Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers this a serious public health concern, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019 coronavirus to the general American public is considered low at this time. To ensure you are informed, USF Student Health Services and our colleagues in USF Health are providing information to help educate you about the virus. To date, China has reported nearly 3,000 confirmed cases of this 2019 coronavirus infection. So far, 81 patients have died, with older age and underlying disease as co-factors. Cases are confirmed outside of China, with all linking to travelers from Wuhan. The first case in the United States, reported in Washington state, was recognized on January 20, 2020. The U.S. has started screening travelers arriving from China at several major airports. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Patients with confirmed 2019 coronavirus infection generally experience a mild respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever cough shortness of breath Symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. If untreated, the virus can cause pneumonia and, in severe cases, even death. HOW DOES IT SPREAD? Person-to-person spread is believed to occur via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. TIPS FOR PREVENTION Prevent the spread of respiratory viruses by following hand and respiratory hygiene and safe food practices: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS Keep in mind that this is the cold and flu season, so don't jump to conclusions that you have the coronavirus because you have the symptoms. If you are sick, make an appointment to see your doctor. Students should contact the following to make an appointment to see our health professionals: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg: Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee: Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you are severely ill and cannot get to SHS or your doctor, call 911 or go to an emergency room at the local hospital. MORE INFORMATION For more information about the coronavirus, visit: Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) World Health Organization (WHO) If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your medical provider.

USF,31-Jan-2020,"JANUARY 31, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF community, Our University of South Florida leadership team is closely monitoring the latest information related to a novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, but has now spread to other parts of the world, including portions of the United States. At this time, no cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the state of Florida.  University officials have initiated communication, coordination and planning with local health departments using the most up-to-date information from state and federal health organizations. The U.S. Department of State and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now issued guidance advising Americans to avoid travel to China.  As such, out of an abundance of caution, USF is temporarily suspending all university-related travel to China for students and faculty.  No travel to this area will be authorized until further notice. Although no cases have been reported in Florida, USF Health and USF Student Health Services have provided important information about the virus, tips for prevention and other helpful resources.

USF,28-Feb-2020,"FEBRUARY 28, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF community, The University of South Florida continues to closely monitor the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority as university leaders work closely with local, state and federal agencies to share the most updated information. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the state of Florida. The following information is intended to help inform travel plans in the coming weeks and provide guidance from USF Health experts. USF World international travel guidance USF will continue to follow guidelines from the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control to assess the risk associated with the international destinations of USF travelers. Please be advised: the current situation is very fluid. Conditions can change rapidly in the country you are visiting and could impact your ability to re-enter the U.S. USF has processes in place to review planned international travel. Student travel to a U.S. Department of State Risk Level 3 or 4 location, or a CDC Level 3 location, is not permitted. Presently, China and South Korea fall into these categories. All student travel to these locations is currently prohibited. Given the current global conditions, USF is suspending all future faculty and staff business travel to U.S. Department of State Risk Level 4 locations, or CDC Level 3 locations until further notice. We expect faculty and staff adhere to travel guidelines determined by university policy and procedure, however deans and supervisors can further limit faculty or staff travel given heightened health and safety concerns. Faculty and staff are encouraged to consult with their dean or designated supervisor prior to scheduling any type of international travel for university business. At this time, all USF spring and summer study abroad programs in locations outside CDC Level 3 Advisory areas remain in place. Should it become necessary to cancel any programs, students and faculty will be contacted immediately. Before you travel, pay attention to the risk levels of any country you are visiting, understanding that risk assessments may change from day to day. Airports worldwide have set up, or are in the process of setting up, health-screening checkpoints for international passengers. At this time, anyone with a fever or other flu-like symptoms should not travel internationally, as they may be detained for further testing and observation. The International Air Transport Association has a continuously updated website for countries around the world that is a valuable resource for travelers. If you are outside the United States and need assistance, contact the USF World 24/7 International Assistance Line +1-813-317-5815 or by email. If you are concerned about the status of a future study abroad program, contact your Education Abroad Program Manager or you may reach out to James Pulos, Associate Director, USF Education Abroad. All students enrolled in education abroad programs have been contacted via email. Please be sure to check your email regularly for important communications. If you are a business traveler with questions about a planned overseas trip, contact Ben Chamberlain, Risk and Security Officer. HEALTH GUIDANCE For the general American public, the immediate health risk is currently low. Nonetheless, there is increasing concern that person-to-person spread will eventually occur more widely in the United States. Keep in mind that this is the cold and flu season, so you should not assume you have the coronavirus even if you have similar symptoms. If you are sick, stay home and make an appointment to see your doctor. Students should contact the following to make an appointment to see our health professionals: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg: Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee: Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you are severely ill and cannot get to a doctor, call 911 or go to an emergency department at a local hospital. If you are returning from a country with coronavirus and you are requested to maintain 14 days of self-isolation, please contact Dr. Joseph Puccio, Executive Director of Student Health Services, at 813-974-0444. PREVENTION It is always a good idea to practice habits that help prevent disease, especially during cold and flu season: Obtain the influenza vaccine if you haven’t already. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Regularly wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, particularly if you have been in contact with someone who is sick. Use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Should the coronavirus evolve to more directly impact the state of Florida or the Tampa Bay region, be assured that USF’s Emergency Management team and our university leadership have plans in place to adequately ensure appropriate response, coordination of resources and continuity of academic and business operations as necessary. For reliable, up-to-date information, visit: Florida Department of Health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention World Health Organization USF has also set up a dedicated website for updated information and resources. Please continue to check usf.edu/coronavirus for details. The health and well-being of our community is of utmost importance.

Continue to check this web page for the most up-to-date information. *NEW INFORMATION AS OF MONDAY, MARCH 2* There have now been two confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida. There is no evidence to suggest that either of these cases has any connection to the USF community at this time. The Governor’s Office has now declared a State of Emergency for Florida, which provides additional guidance for state healthcare professionals. As of this date, the CDC has designated several countries as Risk Level 3. USF prohibits student, faculty and staff travel to these destinations. CDC risk assessments may change from day to day; check back frequently. The Florida Board of Governors has asked universities to cancel all university-sponsored travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea. Per the same communication, all faculty, employees and students who have traveled to these countries are being asked to return home and self-quarantine away from campus for 14 days. Recognizing that our USF community is looking forward to spring break, please be aware that the CDC is cautioning that individuals traveling abroad “may face unpredictable circumstances, travel restrictions, challenges returning home, or accessing health care while abroad.” USF leadership will release more detailed guidance regarding spring break Education Abroad programming in the coming days.

USF,11-Mar-2020,"MARCH 11, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, In light of the continuing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), I wish to share with you some important updates for our university community. These decisions have been informed by official directive from state leaders as we work to maintain the health and wellness of our campus and our communities within the state of Florida. REMOTE INSTRUCTION FOR COURSES As directed by the Florida Board of Governors, we will begin transitioning all of our classes to remote instruction for two weeks following spring break, March 23 through at least April 5. Students traveling for spring break next week should plan to not return to campus for at least two weeks following. Students who had not been planning to travel for spring break should make plans to return home, if possible. Although students are encouraged to remain off campus during this time, residential students who wish to remain in their residence halls may do so. If you have questions or need to make other arrangements, contact Housing and Residential Education at 813-974-0001 or housing@usf.edu. International students and foreign exchange students will receive further guidance from USF World. All classes and necessary support functions will continue remotely. USF has developed a myriad of tools, technologies, training and other resources to assist in this transition. Earlier this week, we rolled out a USF Toolkit for Instructional Continuity for faculty to assist with remote delivery preparations. We have also assembled a USF Toolkit for Continuity of Student Support to facilitate remote student access to important resources and services, such as counseling, advising, tutoring and other needs. While classes are moving to remote delivery, many normal university operations will continue, including Student Health Services, USF Health clinical operations and university administration and staff functions. If you have specific questions about your unit, contact your supervisor. CAMPUS OR UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED EVENTS At this time, all university-sponsored events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus scheduled in the next 30 days must be postponed or canceled. Questions about a particular event should be directed to the appropriate vice president. Athletics events will be addressed in the near future. If you are considering live-streaming or recording events in lieu of offering them in person, please contact IT Services to determine feasibility and costs. Questions on financial impacts resulting from cancellation should be directed to BUSFIN-SRD@usf.edu. Questions on any legal matters can be directed to Gerard Solis at gsolis@usf.edu. These recommendations will be reevaluated on an ongoing basis and new guidance provided as needed. USF EMPLOYEE GUIDANCE At this point, all healthy USF employees are expected to maintain normal work operations, although some adjustments may need to be made on a case-by-case basis. If an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is directed to self-isolate by a medical professional or public health official, the employee should notify their supervisor and follow official guidance for the duration of the isolation period. If anyone in self-isolation can and would like to continue working remotely, they may, with approval of their supervisor. Employees choosing to self-isolate out of concern for their health or the health of others must follow normal work rules, which cover sick leave, vacation or other leave policies. Leave should be requested from their supervisor. In the event that more extensive university closures are required, additional procedures may be developed to cover employees’ time off. Please contact USF Human Resources at 813-974-2970 or Employee-Relations@usf.edu with additional questions. HEALTH GUIDANCE Please continue to sanitize your workstations and personal spaces and continue to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when you are sick. Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. Students who need guidance or medical assistance should contact Student Health Services: Tampa Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 The health and wellness of the USF community is always our first priority. We deeply appreciate your adaptability as we work to respond to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor this situation, using guidance from our partners at the state and national levels, and provide additional updates as they are available.

USF,11-Mar-2020,"MARCH 11, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY The University of South Florida announced several operational changes on Wednesday, March 11, in light of continuing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus). The health and wellness of students, faculty and staff is USF’s first priority as university leaders work closely with local, state and federal agencies to monitor the coronavirus. As directed by the Florida Board of Governors, USF will join other state universities in transitioning all classes to remote instruction as soon as possible. For USF, fully remote instruction will begin March 23, following spring break. This will continue through at least April 5. Student support functions, such as counseling and advising, will continue remotely. While classes are moving to remote delivery, USF’s campuses will remain open and many normal university operations will continue, including Student Health Services and USF Health clinical operations. USF residence halls remain open, however, students are encouraged to remain off campus during this time, if other reasonable accommodations are possible. With spring break approaching, we recommend you discuss, as a family, what plans you have if your student is required to self-quarantine for a two-week period for any reason (including illness or travel to an affected area). Your plan should include a possible quarantine location other than a shared living space, such as a residence hall or multi-occupancy apartment. Should your student need to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework. For the next 30 days, all university-sponsored events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus will be postponed or canceled. For details on athletic events, please visit the USF Athletics website for the most up-to-date information. USF will continue to evaluate the situation and new guidance will be provided as needed. The university community and public can continue to check this website for the latest information and resources available",314,fl,3
USF,12-Mar-2020,"MARCH 12, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF Education Abroad Students on Faculty-Led Programs, I am sure all of you are aware, global concerns over the COVID-19/coronavirus have caused several governments, including our own, to restrict travel. Our students’ health and safety are our priority. Therefore, it is with great regret that we announce the cancelations of USF’s spring and summer faculty-led programming through July 31, 2020. USF will remove all study abroad program costs placed on your student account. We hope to have all of this completed within a 30-day period. Regarding purchased airfare, we recommend that you request a full refund of your airfare or a full credit for future travel from your chosen airline. All major U.S. airlines have now indicated they are willing to either refund the cost of your flight, or award you a full credit for you to use over the next year. Note: Due to the high volume of calls, airlines may not be able to immediately process requests for flights scheduled for later dates. Please be patient with this process. Obtaining a refund may take several weeks. Should you require further guidance, please contact the Education Abroad Gateway Office at (813) 974-5474. We know this news is disappointing. We hope that once the global public health crisis resolves, you will consider traveling abroad through USF again. If you have questions or concerns specific to your program, please contact your program manager directly. Reach out to our main e-mail for general questions or questions about airfare (EducationAbroad@usf.edu). Kind Regards, Education Abroad Office",256,fl,3
USF,13-Mar-2020,"MARCH 13, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF students, The health and wellness of our community is of our highest priority, and YOU play an important role. As we leave for spring break, our students have been strongly directed not to return to campus until face-to-face classes resume, currently scheduled for April 6. The university took this drastic step with the hope of protecting the entire USF campus and our surrounding community, which includes many vulnerable populations, from the coronavirus. Limiting the numbers of people moving on and off the campus is an important step in reducing the potential for transmission of the COVID-19 virus. If there are students who do not have off-campus alternatives and must return to their residence halls, please be aware that services will be significantly limited, and certain amenities will not be offered, such as: Libraries will be closed. The Marshall Student Center in Tampa will be closed; the University Student Center in St. Petersburg will be open in order to offer limited dining, but there will be no events, social activities or other special services available. All campus recreation facilities and pools on all campuses will be closed. All residence hall lounges and community spaces will be closed. All university events, on or off campus, have been canceled. We will have limited dining hours and options. We will have a limited or suspended Bull-Runner schedule. If you do need to stay on campus, please practice social distancing. Do not put yourself in areas of large groups, and maintain at least 6-10 feet between people. Minimize your activity within and beyond the residence halls. Continue to practice good hygiene. This is a very fluid, dynamic situation. Please understand that the university’s circumstances could change at any time. We will continue to update you as the situation evolves. If you have any questions about your housing needs, please contact: housing@usf.edu for Tampa students or housing@usfsp.edu for St. Petersburg. If you have health-related questions, contact Student Health Services: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you have other questions about the university’s response to COVID-19, contact: COVIDquestions@usf.edu.",367,fl,3
USF,13-Mar-2020,"MARCH 13, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, I am writing with an important follow up to my previous communications regarding our responses to the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As you are aware, following a Florida Board of Governors’ directive, we are transitioning all of our classes to remote instruction following Spring Break, beginning Monday March 23 through at least April 5. To support this swift transition, we have developed several critical resources, including a set of Frequently Asked Questions, a Faculty Toolkit for Instructional Continuity, and a Student Toolkit for Continuity of Support. The Frequently Asked Questions provide answers to many of the important questions we have received over the last few days. Please note that this is a living document and will be updated as we work to respond to your questions and the rapidly spreading virus. As a reminder, all courses must be transitioned and ready for remote instructional delivery beginning Monday, March 23. Faculty are provided with training opportunities to help leverage Canvas and other tools for remote instruction. Both face-to-face and live stream sessions will be offered on all three campuses throughout Spring Break. I strongly encourage you to sign-up at your earliest opportunity to ensure timely transition to remote class delivery. Most importantly, I want to thank you for your continuing dedication to the University of South Florida, and especially to the support of our students, during these challenging times. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Executive Vice President",243,fl,3
USF,15-Mar-2020,"MARCH 15, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, Our leadership team continues to closely monitor the evolving dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our community. As of March 15, the following encompasses the latest guidance from university leadership regarding remote work options. Expect regular updates as the situation evolves. While the university continues to be open and operational, supervisors are being asked to strongly encourage any employees (faculty, staff, OPS) who can work remotely to do so until at least April 6, when face-to-face classes are scheduled to resume. Employees must work with their supervisors to develop a plan that allows them to meet deliverables and maintain communication, productivity and efficiency. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work or who do not have necessary IT resources should talk to their supervisors about designing on- or off-campus work arrangements that will still fulfill their obligations without exposing undue risks to their own health and safety or that of the campus community. Healthcare-delivery employees, including USF Health clinical staff, Student Health Services staff and veterinary staff, are expected to report to work as usual unless they receive separate guidance from their supervisors. Employees whose personal situations prevent them from working, or who choose to self-isolate on their own accord away from work duties, may use one of the following types of time off, with supervisory approval: Accrued annual leave Accrued sick leave (if the employee or family member is ill) Unpaid leave Employees should contact their immediate supervisors as soon as possible once they know they will be unable to report to work to develop a plan. If an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is directed to self-isolate by a medical professional or public health official, the employee should notify their supervisor and follow official guidance for the duration of the isolation period. If anyone in self-isolation can and would like to continue working remotely, they may, with approval of their supervisor.

USF,17-Mar-2020,"MARCH 17, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, There is nothing more important than the health and wellness of our community as we work to respond to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. It is this belief that guides our every decision, utilizing the latest guidance of our governmental and health leaders. Today, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Board of Governors directed our state universities, including the University of South Florida, to continue providing remote instruction for the duration of the spring semester. This means that, if able, students should make plans to remain off campus until at least May 7. USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) who are able to work remotely should continue to do so until at least April 6, however USF leadership will continue to monitor the situation to provide updated guidance, as needed. Student Health Services and USF Health clinical operations will continue as usual, unless otherwise noted Residential students will receive separate guidance shortly. Commencement is a vital element of our university community and an important milestone in the lives of our students and their families. Per Board of Governors direction, the spring 2020 commencement scheduled for May is postponed until further notice. We understand this is very disappointing to our graduates and their families. This is not a decision we take lightly, and we are working diligently with student leaders to develop creative alternative solutions to give our graduates the recognition they have rightly earned, including the possibility of expanding August ceremonies to include spring graduates. More details will be provided as soon as possible. USF is dedicated to the success of our students. We are also committed to the availability of high-quality online course delivery throughout the summer to ensure academic continuity. REMOTE INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES All classes and necessary support functions will continue remotely through the spring semester. USF has developed a myriad of tools, technologies, training and other resources to assist in this transition. We have now updated both our USF Toolkit for Instructional Continuity for faculty and our USF Toolkit for Continuity of Student Support to facilitate remote student access to important resources and services, such as counseling, advising, tutoring and other needs. Importantly, beginning next week, all students will have access to Microsoft Teams and Office 365, providing an additional resource for collaboration with faculty and student peers. A separate communication will follow shortly with more details from USF IT. CAMPUS EVENTS AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS Per federal guidance, individuals should limit any gatherings of more than 10 people for at least the next two weeks. This means that all face-to-face meetings, organizational gatherings or other social events of this size should be canceled or conducted virtually. All events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus are postponed or canceled until further notice. USF Libraries will also be closed to all visitors (USF faculty, staff, students and the general public) until further notice. Virtual library services will continue for students and faculty. USF EMPLOYEE GUIDANCE Per guidance provided March 15, any USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) who can work remotely should do so until at least April 6. USF leadership will continue to monitor the situation to provide updated guidance, as needed. Employees must work with their supervisors to develop a plan that allows them to meet deliverables and maintain communication, productivity and efficiency. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work or who do not have necessary IT resources should talk to their supervisors about designing on- or off-campus work arrangements that will still fulfill their obligations without exposing undue risks to their own health and safety or that of the campus community. Healthcare-delivery employees, including USF Health clinical staff and Student Health Services staff, are expected to report to work as usual unless they receive separate guidance from their supervisors. For guidance with IT resources visit www.usf.edu/it-remote-resources. Please contact USF Human Resources at 813-974-2970 or Employee-Relations@usf.edu with additional questions. Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. HEALTH GUIDANCE Please continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Students who need guidance or medical assistance should contact Student Health Services: Tampa Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 The health and wellness of the USF community is always our first priority. We deeply appreciate your adaptability as we work to respond to this rapidly evolving pandemic. Thank you, Steve Currall President and Professor",811,fl,3
USF,20-Mar-2020,"MARCH 20, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF students, Welcome back from spring break. So much has happened over the past two weeks that I wanted to take a moment to provide some important information and resources that will help you transition to a remote learning environment and successfully complete the semester. CANVAS: YOUR NEW CLASSROOM Starting Monday, March 23, through the end of the spring semester, all classes on USF’s three campuses will be taught remotely, using Canvas and other technologies. Please be patient with the process and your professors. They have been working hard to transition their instructional methods and assignments into Canvas with minimal interruption to your learning. Please log into Canvas now before your classes resume to make sure you have the access you need. If you have issues with Canvas, contact USF Information Technology immediately to allow time for the issue to be resolved. Visit www.usf.edu/it/remote/index.aspx for help. Take time this weekend to become familiar with your courses on Canvas, how they’re set-up and structured, as well as review any directions from your professors. Email them if you have questions, but please be patient. Your instructors are also adapting to a rapidly changing environment and they are communicating with many other students. When your classes resume, take these steps to ensure academic success: Sign on to Canvas each morning. Monitor professor announcements, emails and assignment updates. Be signed on and ready to learn at your designated class time. Use the Canvas calendar function to see assignment due dates. Utilize faculty online office hours to address your concerns and needs. MICROSOFT TEAMS FOR COLLABORATION To allow for greater collaboration for remote learning, USF is making Microsoft Teams and Office 365 available to you as an added benefit. This access requires a change to your USF email address; therefore, beginning March 23, IT will start rolling out new Office 365 email addresses (@usf.edu) for all students, which will become your primary USF address. Although this replaces your USF Gmail address (@mail.usf.edu), your Gmail address will still be available and will forward any messages to your new Office 365 address. For more information about accessing Microsoft Teams, using your new email address (including setting up your phone), and any related questions, visit www.usf.edu/teams-for-students. INTERNET ACCESS VIA EDUROAM If you live in an area where broadband internet access is difficult, as a USF student, you have access to the national eduroam system. Visit https://incommon.org/eduroam/eduroam-u-s-locator-map/ for a map indicating all the eduroam sites in the U.S. If you can get a wifi signal at any of these sites and your device has already been configured for eduroam, it will automatically connect. Otherwise, simply choose the eduroam network. STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES Although many facilities on our campuses are closed or operating with minimal staffing, USF continues to offer you essential student support services, including tutoring, advising, IT Help Desk, financial aid, registrar, and more. Visit the Student Toolkit online at www.usf.edu/academic-continuity/student-toolkit/ to see what is available and how to access these services. STAY HEALTHY, BULLS To finish this semester strong, you need to stay healthy. Please observe the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and practice social distancing. Even if the virus proves not to be a major threat to your health, getting sick could impact your academic success. Student Health Services is open and ready to serve you, in person or remotely. Their contact information is in the Student Toolkit. Anxiety, social distancing, and the usual end-of-semester stress can take its toll as you hunker down to slow the spread of COVID-19. Our counselors will be available to help you with online resources, therapy, and virtual drop-in groups. Take advantage of these resources; learn more by visiting the links in the Student Toolkit. ASK FOR HELP I know that this is a lot of information to digest and act on before Monday. I also know that you are intelligent and resilient. You are a USF Bull, after all! You are capable of taking on remote learning, and I am confident that, by using the resources available to you, you will finish this semester strong. This is not the time to keep to yourself if you need help. Use the contacts in the Student Toolkit, your professors, advisors, the Dean of Students, the Student Ombuds, and any other employee of the university to help you.  It is our job to give you every opportunity to succeed, and we are ready to work for you! Please know that we have been listening to you with regard to class grading options. We understand, we care, and we are ready to take action in addressing your concerns shortly. I want to sincerely thank you for your patience and flexibility and wish you and your loved ones good health as we navigate this global challenge together. Sincerely, Paul Dosal, Ph.D. Vice President for Student Success University of South Florida",812,fl,3
USF,21-Mar-2020,"MARCH 21, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, As USF’s scheduled Spring break comes to a close and the rapid transition to remote instructional delivery nears, I wanted to take a moment to share how deeply appreciative I am of the tireless dedication you have shown in the face of unprecedented events and the disruption in your lives. Your efforts and accomplishments have been truly inspirational as you strive to prepare to meet the continuing educational needs of our students.  Each day I hear remarkable stories from our academic and student success leadership teams of the sacrifices and commitment exhibited by our faculty members across all three campuses. And special thanks to our colleagues in USF Health who are wrestling daily with the layered complexities associated with continuing clinical care. As we all recognize, in recent weeks, we have found ourselves blown into uncharted waters and we are struggling to navigate our way, fighting unpredictable winds, and currents, with likely storms on the horizon. I understand the anxiety and fear of the unknown that such uncertainty can bring, especially as our lives have been thrown into turmoil and we seek to stay connected with, and support, our loved ones including those at a geographical distance. First, I ask you to take good care of yourselves and your loved ones.  Follow the well-published precautions from the CDC and practice social distancing as you work remotely. Behave as if you have the virus for some of us likely do, and we just don’t know it. Each one of us must do all that we can to limit community spread and “flatten the curve.” Life is precious. Care for yourself and for others. As you search for a glimmer of normalcy in these uncommon times, please stay connected with your loved ones, your students, faculty, and staff colleagues. Look out for one another. For those who find themselves struggling with the impact of social distancing and loneliness, today or tomorrow, you might reach out for counseling support through the USF Employee Assistance Program consider these Tips on Working Remotely along with these Tips and Tricks for Thriving During Self-Isolation. Before we resume class instruction from remote locations, beginning on Monday, March 23, I urge you to review the guidance provided on USF’s official source for information, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) website. While we plan to limit broadcasted messages knowing how inundated your inbox is, we will certainly update you on essential changes as they happen. You will also find helpful guidance in the Faculty Toolkit, the Current Student Toolkit, and on the FAQ page. We anticipate the coming days to be a little “bumpy” for some of our students, faculty, and staff as, collectively, we navigate a new course. Most importantly, I ask that you remain mindful of what your students, faculty and staff colleagues are coping with during these challenging times. Communicate with them regularly, yet please set reasonable expectations for response and be patient. Our students will look to you for calm, clear, concise, consistent, and confident guidance, all sprinkled with a heavy dose of compassion. To be clear, this is not to suggest that we compromise academic integrity, for we must still expect our students to demonstrate mastery of student learning outcomes, albeit, in some cases, in quite different ways. Your students will be looking for your ongoing support outside of the virtual classroom, so please make provision for remote “office hours.” Please be sure to maintain access to your students’ USF email addresses and request their telephone contacts in case one or more of our trusted digital platforms experience an interruption in service. Please remain particularly sensitive to the needs of those students expecting to graduate this semester, for they have already been disappointed by the news that commencement will be postponed. Most importantly, please stay in close contact with your department chair, school director, or college dean. Let them know if you need additional support, and if you are not able to fulfill your instructional assignment. We also know that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about major disruptions in the lives of our faculty that may temporarily prevent or interrupt their scholarly productivity and achievements. This problem is especially acute for those faculty members in their probationary period and who are working towards tenure. Therefore, the university is making available an extension to the tenure-clock by one academic year, for eligible tenure-earning faculty members. This action has been carefully considered, and endorsed by, the faculty senate presidents on all USF campuses, the president of the USF System Faculty Council, all College Deans (across all campuses), leadership of the USF chapter of the United Faculty of Florida, the Senior Vice President for USF Health, the Provost and University President. You can learn more about USF’s extension of the tenure-clock here. With a mind to easing the burden on faculty members, faculty committees, and academic leaders at a time when your rightful focus is on transitioning to remote instructional delivery, we are permitting colleges, schools, and departments to relax their annual faculty evaluation deadlines. Chairs on 12-month appointments (and Deans as appropriate) must complete the process and notify faculty that evaluations are available for review no later than June 5, 2020 (per the USF-UFF CBA). At that time, faculty must review and sign the document. Chairs on 9-month appointments must complete their responsibilities by May 5, 2020. Please know that we continue to monitor developments and will work to support your focus on meeting our students’ needs. As we can all acknowledge, these are not normal times and we should not expect to follow normal practices. Your deans, directors, and chairs, along with the broader academic and student success leadership teams, are here to support you. Please let us know how we can help? Meantime, please do all that you can to stay healthy as, together, we strive to balance the needs of our loved ones, our students, and the broader USF community. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost & Executive Vice President",1000,fl,3
USF,24-Mar-2020,"MARCH 24, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, I know that many of you have been hearing from our students that they are deeply concerned about the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on their academic performance during the current semester. Our primary responsibilities are to care for our students’ health and wellbeing, support their continued academic success, provide a mechanism for students to reduce uncertainty in the short-term and not to prolong and elevate the stress and anxiety they are facing, all while focusing on their achievement of student learning outcomes. For the past week, USF’s Academic and Student Success leadership team, across all campuses, has been developing a thoughtful yet temporary shift in course grading options that will permit students to request a change from the awarding of letter grades to Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) for Spring 2020. Throughout this process, we have consulted with college deans, student leaders, Faculty Senate presidents on all campuses, along with the president of the USF System Faculty Council, and we have sought guidance from SACSCOC and specialized accrediting agencies. This temporary change has been approved unanimously by the aforementioned stakeholders and USF leadership, including the senior vice president for USF Health, the provost, and the president. Because you will have questions, and I’m quite sure you will soon hear from your students, I wanted to provide you with the courtesy of this advanced notice. Tomorrow (Wednesday, March 25), we will share this temporary change in course grading option with our students and post a set of related FAQs for students, faculty and staff, which will provide essential guidance and full details on this matter. The following information will be important for faculty members to understand: Instructors will not need to take any action as students carefully consider well-informed decisions concerning this option. Instructors will continue to submit letter grades for students through Canvas. Faculty members will not know (unless a student informs them) which students in their class(es) have opted for a shift to S/U. For those students choosing this option, the S/U will be awarded based upon letter grade equivalency in the current catalog. This notice will include important guidance on Withdrawal (which we discourage) and Incomplete grades. You will be able to access all details, beginning tomorrow, at the Faculty Toolkit. Meanwhile, thank you again for the dedication that you have shown during these extraordinary times. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Executive Vice President",403,fl,3
USF,25-Mar-2020,"MARCH 25, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, The University of South Florida is working diligently to monitor the evolving COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, providing you with important updates as they happen. Today we learned that a student from USF Tampa who had been traveling abroad tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to the U.S. This student, who has not been on campus this semester, is self-isolating in another state and will continue to be monitored by health officials. We have also been informed that an employee in USF Innovative Education on the Tampa campus has tested positive for COVID-19. This individual is being monitored by health officials, following guidance established by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The employee has not been on campus since March 13. Students and staff members who may have come into close contact with these individuals are being contacted separately with appropriate health guidance. We sincerely wish both members of our community a full and rapid recovery. As a reminder, students are strongly encouraged to remain off campus for the rest of the spring semester. USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) should continue to work remotely with supervisor approval until further notice. Students who need guidance or medical assistance should contact Student Health Services: Tampa Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. I would also like to share an update on our future process to notify students, faculty and staff about confirmed cases within the USF community.  We have established a new page of our coronavirus website dedicated to providing information about positive tests. The website will be continually updated as USF is informed of any individuals who test positive.  When USF becomes aware of a confirmed case, we will also reach out to the leadership of a potentially impacted college, department or unit to offer information that can be provided to their constituents. We also encourage you to continue to follow updates on the Florida Department of Health’s website regarding positive testing data by county and across the state. As always, the health and safety of our community is of paramount importance as we work closely with our local, state and federal partners. Sincerely, Steve Currall President and Professor",414,fl,3
USF,26-Mar-2020,"MARCH 26, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS APRIL 2, 2020 UPDATE Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order number 20-19 regarding essential services and activities during the COVID-19 emergency effective 12:01 a.m. April 3, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This order requires all persons in Florida to limit movements and personal interactions outside of one’s home to only those necessary to obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities. In accordance with this order, USF has suspended the scheduled move-out period of April 8 –May 10 for students away from campus who had planned to return to campus to retrieve their personal belongings. Read the message sent to residents currently off campus on April 2, 2020. Students currently on campus, besides those approved to remain on campus, have been sent individualized instructions for move-out. Dear USF residents, USF’s highest priority is the health and safety of our community. As the COVID-19 crisis rapidly evolves, and in accordance with guidance from local, state and federal officials, we have important and timely new instructions to share with our on-campus residents. We deeply appreciate your continued patience, cooperation and understanding as we work together to protect our campus and the surrounding community. We have developed the following plan to credit housing charges and complete a safe and orderly move out for those students who are able to do so. As always, we will work with any residential student who does not have another suitable option for housing so that the resident can remain in campus housing. The refunds will initially appear as credits on your Oasis account, and then be refunded to you as described in this plan. In order for the plan to work smoothly, we divided residential students into two categories: (1) those who are physically present on campus at this time and (2) those who are not physically present on campus at this time. Please see the category below that describes your situation for specific instructions. RESIDENTS WHO ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT ON CAMPUS All residents currently residing (physically present) on-campus must vacate their room by noon on Monday, April 6, UNLESS you fall into one of the categories below and obtain approval via the Housing Portal: International students unable to travel or concerned about not being able to return to USF when in person classes resume Residents without permanent housing or who are unable to return home Residents whose guardians are considered higher risk (compromised immunity, pre-existing conditions, positive COVID-19 test or self-isolating) Residents who will not have online access if they return home Residents with other hardships (to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis) Requests for exceptions must be received no later than 9 a.m. on Monday, March 30, by completing the ‘exception to remain on campus’ form in the Housing Portal. You will be notified via email from Housing & Residential Education if you are granted an exception. At noon on Monday, April 6, all student card access to residential buildings will be deactivated UNLESS a student has been approved to stay for the remainder of the semester. The 24-hour desks have adjusted hours to 6 a.m. – 9 p.m. each day. Residents should return their keys during this time period Besides those approved to stay, USF will end all residents’ current housing agreements and issue a credit to their Oasis account for rent from Monday, March 23, through the remainder of their housing agreement. Those residents approved to remain on-campus may need to relocate from their current room to another building or area of campus later in the semester, to be determined; however, their current housing rate will remain the same. RESIDENTS WHO ARE PHYSICALLY OFF CAMPUS AT THIS TIME All students not physically residing on campus as of the date of this message, may not return to campus until they receive an approved move-out date and time (see below). Our intention is to start to allow residents to return to campus and move-out beginning on Wednesday, April 8. All move-outs will be scheduled to be completed by noon on Friday, May 8.

USF,27-Mar-2020,"MARCH 27, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear USF employees, Thank you for all you are doing to help USF maintain business and academic continuity during this unprecedented time of uncertainty. Our leadership team is committed to proving you with timely updates and important resources as we navigate this challenge together. Over the past week, we have received new guidance from both local officials and the federal government that have implications on our employment practices. This includes new “Safer at Home” ordinances locally, as well as changes to employee paid leave rights at the federal level. “Safer at Home” In light of the significant health risk posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, Pinellas County and Hillsborough County passed a “safer at home” directives, asking all county residents to remain at home except for essential activities such as trips for groceries, medical needs and jobs that are deemed critical. This directive aligns with the March 13 guidance from President Currall, which instructed any USF employees who can work remotely to do so. The Pinellas County order was effective as of Thursday, March 26, at noon. The Hillsborough County order is effective as of Friday, March 27, at midnight. According to the ordinances, essential businesses, which includes state educational institutions like USF, are allowed to continue internal and minimum basic operations as long as they follow the Center for Disease Control’s social distancing guidance (six feet of separation from others and no group gatherings of more than 10). Nevertheless, remote work is preferred if possible, per President Currall’s directive. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work should coordinate with their supervisors to design on- or off-campus work arrangements that fulfill their obligations while complying with CDC social distancing guidance and protecting their health, as well as the health of others. Families First Coronavirus Response Act: Employee Paid Leave Rights The newly passed federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) provides employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. These provisions will apply from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Under these new guidelines, employees are eligible for two weeks of paid sick time for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employees employed for at least 30 days are eligible for up to an additional 10 weeks of paid family leave to care for a child under certain circumstances related to COVID-19. An employee qualifies for paid sick time if the employee is unable to work (or unable to telework) because the employee: is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19; has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19; is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis; is caring for an individual subject to an order described in (1) or self-quarantine as described in (2); is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19; or is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury. Entitlements are subject to whether an employee is full-time and/or part-time, and monetary caps apply. Find additional information and frequently asked questions here. If you have additional questions, and to determine your eligibility under this new act, please contact the Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. The health and safety of our university community remains our first priority, and we appreciate your continued patience, adaptability and understanding.",604,fl,3

The credit will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from March 23 through May 8, 2020, plus the total amount of unused dining dollars. For students who returned to campus on or after Monday, March 23, but subsequently left campus early due to COVID-19, a partial meal plan credit will be issued. The credit will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from the last date of use through May 8, 2020, plus the total amount of unused dining dollars. The credit will appear on the student’s Oasis account by Friday, April 10. It is important to note that the amount of any credit will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s Oasis account, with any remaining credit refunded to the student. USF will make every effort to issue the available refund within a two-week processing period, following the posting of the credit. Specific information regarding refunds can be found on the University Cashier’s website. In order to expedite receipt of any refund owed to you, please create an electronic deposit (eDeposit) account, if you have not already done so. Follow the instructions below to set up eDeposit in your Oasis account: Go to my.usf.edu Sign in using your USF NetID & Password Go into the OASIS website Select “Tuition & Fees” on the “Student” tab Select “Subscribe to eDeposit” Follow directions at the subscription site At this time, The Hub will remain open for to-go service and meal plans will still be active for students who continue to reside on campus. Please visit www.usfdining.com for all updates on hours and dining related information. Thank you for your patience and cooperation during this unprecedented time. We deeply regret that your campus experience has been cut short and the inconvenience that these changes may have caused you. We look forward to continue serving your dining needs in the future.

USF,1-Apr-2020,"APRIL 1, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear USF employees, OnMarch 15, President Currall directed all USF employees who were able to work remotely to do so. At that time, students had moved to remote instruction through at least April 6, and the directive to employees similarly expressed a potential to return to work by that time. However, since the release of that letter, USF has extended remote instruction for students for the duration of the spring semester. Additionally, local""Safer at Home""orders have limited the movement of all but essential employees for the foreseeable future. While USF does qualify as an ""essential business"", as a public university, President Currall continues to urge any USF employees who can work from home to do so until further notice. Only employees who have been designated as critical staff by Emergency Management for the purpose of the COVID-19 response should come to campus for any reason. These employees have official documentation from Emergency Management that they must keep with them at all times while on campus. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work should work with their supervisors to design work arrangements that fulfill their obligations while complying with CDC social distancing guidance and protecting their health, as well as the health of others. If you have questions or concerns about your specific work assignment, contact your supervisor or Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. We would also like to share some important guidance about enhanced services from our State of Florida carriers and Benefits Providers. It is our hope that these new services will be beneficial to you as we navigate the challenges of remote work, social distancing and efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus. NEW TeleHealth services – Offered through Department of Management Services for State of Florida covered employers and covered members in the HMO and PPO plans. Effective immediately, members of the State Group Insurance Health Plans (Standard and High Deductible HMO Plans and the PPO Plan) may use telehealth to access covered health care services from in-network or contracted health care practitioners acting within the scope of their licenses and Florida law. Telehealth services, related to the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 virus or any other preventive care service, will be covered the same as a visit to a participating provider in his or her physical office location.  MA20-001 provides the details. Contact your healthcare provider to confirm participation or reach out to your Health Program Carrier (AvMed, Florida Blue, Aetna) on the MyBenefits website. USF Federal Credit Union – Special Loans and Financial assistance available.  Information on assistance from USFFCU can be found on their website at https://www.usffcu.com/HereForYou. They are offering Skip-a-Pay, Hardship Loans and other services for USFFCU members. NEW Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act – Employees currently enrolled in the USF Voluntary 403(b) Savings Plan should reach out to Fidelity or TIAA for information on Loans and Hardship Withdrawals available to them within the Plan. www.netbenefits.com/usf Read an article related to the CARES Act here. Employee Assistance Program (EAP) – Magellan Health Services has expanded their services to offer TeleHealth services to participants.  More information on this is posted to the DHR EAP webpage. With the goal of providing clear and comprehensive communication about services and programs that are available to our employees during this unprecedented time, USF Human Resources will continue to share updates as we receive them. Our thoughts continue to be with each member of our USF community as we navigate through this crisis together. Stay safe and healthy, GO BULLS!",605,fl,4
USF,2-Apr-2020,"APRIL 2, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS FOR RESIDENTS OFF CAMPUS: THOSE WHO HAVE A MOVE-OUT DATE AND THOSE WHO DID NOT YET SIGN-UP Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order number 20-91 regarding essential services and activities during the COVID-19 emergency effective 12:01 a.m. April 3, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This order requires all persons in Florida to limit movements and personal interactions outside of one’s home to only those necessary to obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities. In accordance with this order, USF has suspended the scheduled move-out period of April 8 – May 10 for students away from campus who had planned to return to campus to retrieve their personal belongings. Students and families should NOT return to campus until notified otherwise. Housing offices and 24-hour desks will not be open on-campus while the Executive Order is in place. Given the ever-changing dynamic of the COVID-19 crisis, we are not able to predict when we will issue a new move-out schedule. We do not anticipate move-outs will begin before mid-May. USF will announce a new move-out plan after the Executive Order is lifted. Until then, personal items will remain secured in students’ rooms. Students currently on campus, besides those approved to remain on campus, have been sent individualized instructions for move-out. We appreciate your flexibility as we update our plan of action in this developing situation. We understand that this is a stressful situation and we are deeply sorry for any hardship this crisis may cause you and your loved ones. Our number one priority is to keep you and our community safe. We will do everything we can to support you while adhering to the guidelines set in place to keep us safe and healthy. USF Tampa campus students, please e-mail our office at housing@usf.edu with any questions. USF St. Petersburg campus students, please e-mail housing@usfsp.edu  with any questions. Sincerely, USF Housing & Residential Education",321,fl,4
USF,9-Apr-2020,"APRIL 9, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear employees, In accordance with Gov. DeSantis’ “safer at home” order, the university has restricted all on-campus operations to Critical Function Personnel only effective April 3, 2020, until at least April 30, 2020. All faculty and staff are encouraged to continue to work remotely until further notice with the following exceptions: On-Campus Critical Function Personnel At this time, Critical Function Personnel are defined as employees designated to report to campus while on-campus operations are restricted, with appropriate documentation issued by Emergency Management. In accordance with the Critical Function Personnel communication sent on March 25 and April 2, authorization is given for the express purpose of enabling those persons who have to get to campus to perform critical functions that cannot be performed remotely to do so. On-campus Critical Function Personnel must be approved by a Dean or VP and include, but are not limited to: Those ensuring the safety and security of campus facilities and community (e.g. health care services, police); Those maintaining research labs that cannot suspend operations; Those providing limited services to students who remain on campus (e.g. housing staff, designated food services); Those required for continuity of services in maintenance/grounds/custodial/transportation; Those who are essential for business continuity (e.g. financial transactions and services staff); Those providing information technology support; Those facilitating distance learning. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that the fewest individuals possible are on campus at any time, in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. For those who must come to campus, departments should continue alternative schedules to promote social distancing, and people should spend the minimum time necessary on campus to perform the authorized critical functions. Temporary Reassignment Program The USF Temporary Reassignment Program has been created to assist employees whose work is not considered essential or critical and who are unable to work remotely with opportunities that could keep them in a paid status by performing alternate, needed work for another university area. Alternate assignments may range from work that can be performed remotely, or in limited cases, critical work that must be performed on a USF campus or at another USF site. Reassignments under this program are optional and are initiated by an employee’s supervisor, working directly with HR. This change in assignment does not alter an employee’s current, established rate of pay and benefits, but may involve change in hours, duties and supervision. The program is temporary and subject to change and may be discontinued with or without notice. Leave options Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), certain employees are eligible for up to 80 hours of emergency sick leave for certain conditions (hours are pro-rated for part-time employees). Those conditions are explained in detail at the Department of Labor (DOL) website. The DOL also provides for expanded Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave up to an additional 10 weeks under specific circumstances. Additionally, a set of frequently asked questions and answers can be found here. For employees performing critical functions on campus, supervisors are encouraged to implement staggered shifts where operations permit in addition to observing published CDC guidance, such as social distancing and good hygiene.  An unintended consequence of staggered shifts is some employees could be unable to work regular full-time hours in a regular work week. Therefore, on a temporary basis, the university will provide up to 80 hours of administrative leave for mission critical employees who are directed to physically report for work on a USF campus through April 30. This program is available to OPS and regular hourly employees only (e.g. salaried employees are excluded). The purpose of this program is to permit hourly employees to complete their essential, on campus duties without worrying about whether they will lose pay on a weekly basis by working on staggered shifts and following additional CDC guidelines. Employees other than those qualifying for the leave above are subject to regular work rules. If the university restricts on-campus operations beyond April 30, leave statuses will be reevaluated at that time. If you have questions or concerns about your specific work assignment, contact your supervisor or the Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. Thank you for your continued patience and adaptability during these uncertain times.",716,fl,4
USF,10-Apr-2020,"APRIL 10, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear faculty and staff, Thank you to all who participated in yesterday’s virtual town hall.  Although we are physically apart, it is inspiring to continue connecting as one USF community. In our first such town hall of its kind, we were joined by roughly 3,500 participants from all across the Tampa Bay region. For those who were not able to join, please find a recording of our session here. I also wish to reiterate my enthusiasm for the newly adopted USF Principles of Community, which will help reinforce a campus climate of mutual support among faculty, staff and students. These Principles will serve as the bedrock for our strategic renewal process, which we began last autumn and will continue this coming summer and autumn.  The Principles will further facilitate our shared strategy, mission, vision and goals for ONE USF, Geographically Distributed. I want to sincerely thank the Task Force for its work, with special recognition to Charles Adams, dean of the Judy Genshaft Honors College and chair of this task force, and Steve Prevaux, university ombuds, who served as its facilitator. Click here to learn more about the Principles and the important process that brought them to fruition. Finally, I want to again offer my sincere appreciation for the incredible adaptability and compassion you have shown during this unprecedented challenge. This crisis has changed the way we live and work, and it will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on our institution. But together, we get to decide what that impact will be.  It’s clear that we will emerge from this crisis stronger, more united and more resilient than ever before. We will prevail! Best wishes, Steven C. Currall President and Professor",285,fl,4
USF,27-Apr-2020,"APRIL 27, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS Dear USF students, USF’s leaders have been working hard with our local, state and federal partners to support you during the COVID-19 crisis. Over the weekend, USF received its $17.4 million portion of a $2.2 trillion economic relief package from the U.S. Department of Education, provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which will be used for emergency student aid. USF will distribute the funds to assist as many of our eligible students as possible to alleviate financial hardships that may impede your academic plans. Please note that funding from the CARES Act comes with eligibility requirements as determined and enforced by the federal government. Current degree-seeking students enrolled at least half time in spring 2020 who are eligible to apply for federal Title IV financial aid are eligible to apply for CARES Act funds. Students enrolled in fully online graduate programs, international, and undocumented students are not eligible per U.S. Department of Education Guidelines. Students with demonstrated needs who did not receive the full $1,000 maximum from the USF United Support Fund are eligible to apply for an additional CARES Act grant. Students who applied for an award from the USF United Support Fund and did not receive an award before those funds were depleted should also apply for a CARES Act grant. Eligible students are invited to complete the Federal CARES Act Emergency Financial Aid Application for consideration for a grant, starting April 27 through Aug. 7, 2020, or until the funds are depleted. Priority will be given to FAFSA filers who have exhausted all financial aid options and who have been impacted by COVID-19 in the following ways: Student and/or spouse loss or reduction of employment (i.e., layoff/furlough or job loss); parental loss or reduction of employment (i.e., layoff/furlough or job loss); or other unexpected circumstances. Examples of expenses eligible to be covered by CARES Act grants include, but are not necessarily limited to, medical bills, food, housing, utilities, technology, course materials, and other unexpected expenses that contribute to the student’s total cost of USF attendance. For more information about the federal CARES Act grant and USF’s distribution of the grant, an FAQ has been created to address your questions. We are already hearing from students whose financial situation is stable now but are concerned about their circumstances in the summer and fall. Given the unknown continued impact of the coronavirus throughout the next several months, a small portion of the federal funding for USF students will be held back for distribution to students during the summer and/or fall. USF is grateful to our federal leaders for providing this important CARES Act emergency funding and helping us support our students. Please explore the grant information and apply early for consideration. Sincerely, Paul Dosal, Ph.D. Vice President of Student Success University of South Florida",476,fl,4
USF,27-Apr-2020,"APRIL 27, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, As we begin the last week of the Spring semester, and the sixth week of remote instruction, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you once more for your professional dedication, and to extend my thoughts and best wishes to you and your loved ones in these most challenging of times. Even as some have settled into the routine of a “new normal,” we continue to witness responses that range from frustration to anxiety, anger, hope, and credulity. I know that many of you are eager to re-enter university life as you remember it. As we look to the future, we will continue to be guided by the scientific evidence, along with the reasoned and trusted advice of our public health professionals, scientists, and epidemiologists as we keep our focus, first and foremost, on assuring the safety and wellbeing of the university community across all campuses. Many of you are wondering when USF will return to full campus-based operations, including classroom instruction? As you know, we earlier committed to delivering a broad suite of quality online courses for students throughout Summer sessions A, C, and B. As we contemplate USF’s future state, we will follow a set of guidelines thoughtfully developed by USF’s COVID-19 Task Force, most likely a phased approach with each step being safely implemented as conditions permit. We are also considering multiple scenarios to minimize potential exposure to the virus, including “low residency,” online, and blended or hybrid classes, as well as physical spacing in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, residence halls, and other high traffic areas. In the near term, we will likely continue online student support services for academic advising, tutoring, telehealth, tele-counseling, career services, and faculty mentoring of student research. For now, though, I ask that you remain focused on bringing this semester to a successful close for you and your students. If you haven’t heard about the nature and utility of Student Assessment of Instruction in Spring 2020, you should soon be hearing from your college dean. Finals are to be conducted in accordance with published exam schedules and final grades submitted no later than Tuesday, May 12. Virtual graduation ceremonies are scheduled for all USF campuses, on Saturday, May 9, 2020. If you are planning to conduct final exams utilizing Proctorio, I strongly encourage you and your students to practice ahead of time to mitigate any potential issues. Faculty utilizing Proctorio for their online assessments should provide students with additional time on their test to ensure proper setup, and include the Proctorio Getting Started Checklist and Practice Test available upon request by emailing facultysupport@usf.edu. You can find additional resources and training by visiting USF’s fully online workshop, Online Proctoring with Proctorio. Meantime, some of you are already working with colleagues from USF Innovative Education to prepare for the delivery of quality online student learning this Summer. These experiences are expected to be quite different than the remote instruction so many transitioned to over Spring Break and, accordingly, “instructors of record” engaged in converting their class to a quality online platform for Summer will be compensated for the additional effort. Recognizing that faculty members are the subject experts, each one is assigned a ""learning designer"" who supports the instructor in both design and delivery of the course. For others, the Summer months will provide a welcome respite to re-engage more fully with your research, scholarly and creative agendas and, perhaps, to bring greater balance to your professional and personal lives. However, as we look ahead to Fall 2020, I strongly encourage you to find some time in the coming months to advance your state of readiness for future disruptions to customary on-campus instruction and learning support, including having your courses ready in Canvas. Some have been asking what the future holds for USF? While members of our community should be rightly interested in the future fiscal health of the higher education sector in these unprecedented times, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that different universities, in different states (and nations), will respond to their unique circumstances in different ways. President Currall has affirmed his commitment to maintaining our institutional vision for the future: rising to become a Top 25 public research university and positioning USF for membership eligibility in the Association of American Universities (AAU). The Board of Trustees recently approved the USF 2020 Accountability Plan (to be submitted to the Board of Governors) that maintains our strategic roadmap. With that said, I can assure you that USF’s leadership is actively and regularly engaged in assessing the university’s fiscal health, continuing and future operations, along with our strategic path forward. As you might imagine, given the continuing uncertainties, it would be premature, and arguably ill-advised, to make decisions affecting the university’s strategic future without being more fully informed. Important data continue to be collected, evaluated, discussed, and USF’s future modeled, in regularly scheduled meetings led by President Currall. Critical stakeholder groups, including USF’s faculty, will be consulted as future plans are developed. For now, I urge you to focus on what you do best: delivering a world-class learning experience for our students and seeking novel answers to complex questions and problems through high impact research and scholarly and creative activity. Most importantly, we should fully anticipate that continuing our record of robust student enrollment, progress, and graduation will influence future decision-making. To that end, we have been working diligently for many weeks to ensure high levels of retention for continuing students and high yield rates for new students in both Summer and Fall semesters. Colleges, departments, professors, and advisors have an important and active role to play in this campaign. Moreover, recognizing that so many of our current and future students and families are facing financial hardship, we have extended the FTIC application and deposit deadlines, waived deposits for students facing financial difficulties due to COVID-19, moved student orientation online, and proposed “rebalancing” student fees for Summer to ensure that students pay no more this year than they did in 2019. In fact, we expect many students will pay less this Summer as we have “paused” collection of course-related fees. As you know, in recent weeks, more than $300,000 has been awarded to students with demonstrated financial need through the USF United Support Fund, and thanks to the generous contributions of so many. You may also have read that USF received an allocation of $17.4 M through the federal CARES Act for emergency financial aid. The first automatic disbursements were made to nearly 6,000 USF students over the past weekend. Applications for additional awards opened today. Meanwhile, university planning and operations continue. Consolidation is on track with the expectation that USF will begin operations as one university, across three campuses, on July 1, 2020. To this end, I have been working closely with multi-campus deans and regional chancellors to ensure equity of assignment, equity of support, and equity in performance expectations beginning this Fall, regardless of a faculty member’s “home campus.” Also, searches for the next dean in the College of the Arts, the College of Marine Science, the College of Nursing, and Undergraduate Studies continue. In closing, it is my wish that in the coming weeks, you are able to restore some balance in your lives. Above all, please get plenty of rest, eat well, exercise, and stay healthy. To prevail in these uncommon times will be akin to running a marathon. We will all need to pace ourselves. Again, please don’t hesitate to reach out to your chairs, deans, or myself should you have questions. Stay close to USF and check the FAQs for regular updates. Rest assured that, as public health conditions, related considerations and, thus, USF’s future becomes clearer, I will do my utmost to provide clear and confident guidance to our highly valued faculty members. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Professor",1307,fl,4

USF,1-May-2020,"MAY 1, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, I hope that you and your families are safe and well. Over the past few months, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted society and altered our normal university life. We are all eager to know what the future holds and when our lives will regain some normalcy. I share your concerns, and I want to take this opportunity to provide some insights into our decision-making process moving forward. As our state and national leaders introduce plans to re-open our economy in phases over the next weeks and months, my leadership team and I are developing similar plans to resume face-to-face instruction and other activities as soon as deemed appropriate. As the USF leadership team has done at every stage of this crisis, we will prioritize the health and safety of our campus community. Normal resumption of operations will only be carried out when community transmission of COVID-19 has diminished and the threat to the university can be safely mitigated. For now, our previous guidance about remote instruction over the summer and employees working remotely until further notice remains in effect. On-campus events, including athletics events and summer camps, will remain suspended through at least July unless you are notified otherwise. We have every intention of resuming face-to-face instruction and some activities during the fall, with modifications and precautions designed to support high-quality academic instruction and student success while maintaining health and safety. These precautions will include but may not be limited to: requiring face coverings, limiting the number of individuals gathered in any one area, enhanced cleaning, and leveraging available testing and contact-tracing resources. We will also likely continue to provide some instruction or operations remotely. Our residential students will receive further guidance regarding fall housing plans from USF’s Housing and Residential Education leaders, once we have more clarity. Our international students should also expect to hear from USF World about how our decisions may impact them. The University of South Florida is and will always be a beacon for optimism and hope. Solving problems and shaping the future is central to our mission. This current challenge has illuminated our mission more clearly than ever. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and innovative thinking of so many of our experts, physicians, nurses, scientists, researchers, and staff members who are on the front lines of understanding and fighting this virus. We should not take for granted how fortunate we are to be part of such a strong ecosystem that thrives on collaboration and creativity. Moreover, we should take comfort knowing that we will not simply endure this crisis, but that USF is playing an integral role in its solutions. There is one thing that we know with absolute certainty: the University of South Florida community will emerge from the current circumstances stronger than ever! We will provide more updates as soon as we have them. Please continue to reach out to COVIDquestions@usf.edu with any additional questions. Steven C. Currall President and Professor",507,fl,5
USF,4-May-2020,"MAY 4, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Student, employee and patient confidentiality laws prevent USF from disclosing the names of individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. Per state and federal guidelines, any individual who has tested positive will be isolated. Any individuals who have concerns about their health are encouraged to work with the appropriate medical professionals and follow guidance from the Florida Department of Health and U.S. Centers for Disease Control. USF will provide updates to the community when the university is informed of a positive case. However, please be aware that if a student, employee or the health department fails to disclose a positive test to the university, USF may have no way of knowing and communicating that information.",124,fl,5
USF,6-May-2020,"May 6, 2020 Dear Resident, Housing & Residential Education has been working hard to plan a safe and successful move-out for our residents currently away from campus. Please take the time to review each section. On Wednesday, April 29, Governor Ron DeSantis announced the “Safe. Smart. Step-by-Step."" Plan for Florida’s Recovery (Executive Order Number 20-112). This order lifts the “Stay at Home” Order (Executive Order number 20-91) in Florida on Monday, May 4, in all counties except Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Therefore, USFSP Housing & Residential Education will begin to re-open the move-out sign up form to allow residents to begin returning to campus, in staggered phases, to move out their belongings. Our philosophy surrounding our move-out plan is focused on an expedient move-out for our residents in the safest way possible. Our plan is based on guidelines from state and local leadership and the CDC, as well as campus layout and resident distribution. In order to accomplish a safe and balanced move-out schedule, we have established move-out timeslots based on building population and resident’s home address on file. As noted above, Florida residents from Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties remain restricted from return to the residence halls, per guidance from the Governor’s Office. Residents from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Louisiana are also restricted (Executive Order Number 20-82 and Executive Order Number 20-86). We will add appropriate dates and times for these residents to return to campus as additional information becomes available. MOVE-OUT DATES/TIMES Please see the table below to identify your move-out window based on your home address in OASIS and your assigned building on campus. Residents who are physically off campus must sign-up via the Housing Portal for a move-out time slot within your assigned dates before returning to campus. To maintain social distancing practices on campus, residents will be permitted in their building only during their selected date and time.",318,fl,5
USF,13-May-2020,"MAY 13, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF students: As we put the Spring 2020 semester in our rearview mirror, I wanted to thank you for your patience and perseverance. The “grit” and determination that you demonstrated in the face of adversity during the past seven weeks has been truly inspiring. It is this attitude that has many of you looking forward and wondering, “What comes next?”, so I thought I would share what I know at this time. Financial Concerns First, I understand that many in our USF community have been impacted by financial hardship, as an untold number of students and family members have lost their jobs. To offer some relief, USF has identified funds that we can award to our students both through our own United Support fundraising efforts and from the federal government. Currently, funds are still available from the CARES Act to students meeting federally mandated requirements. If you have not investigated this funding source, please visit www.usf.edu/financial-aid/cares-act to review the eligibility requirements and apply. [Note: If you have not completed a FAFSA previously, please do so before applying.] Most importantly, USF will soon roll out an unprecedented financial aid stimulus package for students wanting to study full-time this fall, including students who were not eligible for CARES Act funding. The USF Board of Trustees recently took unprecedented action by approving a summer fee package to ensure that student tuition and fees will not increase. As a result, many of you will see a decrease in the cost of your education over last year. We are one of just two Florida universities that have taken such action to date. Academic Continuity Of course, most of you will be continuing your academic journey at USF this summer and in the fall semester. More students have already signed-up for classes than this time last year, so if you haven’t registered for summer and fall yet, now is a good time!  I encourage you to make an appointment with your academic adviser as soon as possible and work with them to stay on track toward timely graduation. Summer sessions A and C begin online on May 18, and session B begins online on June 29. Like you, I am eager to return to campus this Fall whether it be in Tampa, St. Petersburg, or Sarasota-Manatee and, as President Currall made clear in his May 1 letter to our university community “We have every intention of resuming face-to-face instruction and some activities during the fall, with modifications and precautions designed to support high-quality academic instruction and student success while maintaining health and safety.” Our dedicated professors and professional staff are striving to ensure that we continue to deliver a world-class education and university experience, whether online or in-person. Additionally, our undergraduate and graduate students will continue to work alongside our professors in discovering novel solutions to complex problems through research, scholarly, and creative activity. It’s a part of our commitment at a top tier, preeminent research university. As we prepare to resume activities on our campuses this fall, the health and safety of our academic communities remain our highest priority. Of course, campus operations can only return once community transmission of COVID-19 has diminished, and the threat to our communities can be safely mitigated. Life on campus will be different with the introduction of practices that will most likely include enhanced cleaning protocols, physical distancing, required face coverings, testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, or self-isolation when necessary. Throughout our planning, USF is incredibly fortunate to be guided by a world-class team of health professionals and scientists who were studying infectious diseases of this kind long before COVID-19 became part of our daily lives. Wherever you find yourselves this summer and fall, whether in Tampa Bay, somewhere else in Florida, across the nation, or around the world, we are committed to effectively and compassionately ensuring that you can confidently continue your USF journey both inside and outside the classroom. Remember, we’re on this path together, and I hope to see you back on campus and actively engaged in the life of USF very soon. In the meantime, please take care of yourselves, let me know how we can help, and I encourage you to keep a watchful eye on the USF website for regular COVID-19 updates. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox, PhD Provost & Executive Vice President",724,fl,5
USF,19-May-2020,"MAY 19, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, On Monday, the Florida Board of Governors announced that all 12 state universities are preparing to reopen in the fall using a set of guidelines that will be established over the next couple of weeks. The announcement reaffirms what I shared with you earlier this month regarding our intention to resume some face-to-face courses, services and activities in the fall. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff will remain our top priority as we make decisions about how and when to gradually proceed. When we begin to phase in more on-campus operations, you can expect there will be modifications and precautions in place to support a healthy environment. For now, we ask everyone who can to continue working remotely. I understand that many of you are eager to hear more details about what will occur in the fall.  We know you have many questions. I can assure you that my leadership team and I, along with our partners across the State University System and the Board of Governors, are working diligently to fully develop our plans. I want to use this opportunity to outline the deliberative process we’re using to make these important decisions and a timeline. The USF COVID-19 Task Force formed in early March and led by USF College of Public Health Dean Donna Petersen, is providing my leadership team with valuable analysis and options regarding a phased-in approach for returning to our campuses. USF is fortunate to have world-class public health and medical experts among our faculty to help guide us through this process. The task force includes broad membership from across the university, including Academic Affairs, Student Success, Research and Innovation, USF Health, Student Health Services, representatives from each of our campuses and others. Working closely with the task force, the USF Emergency Management team, under the capable leadership of Jennifer Fleischman, has adapted our existing University Recovery Plan to include nine workgroups charged with developing a set of considerations and proposals for my leadership team to evaluate. These groups are assessing the key aspects of increasing on-campus operations, including community wellness, academic continuity and support services, financial resources, facilities, student housing and more. In early June, we expect to present our plan for the fall to the USF Board of Trustees, and on June 23 we’ll do the same with the Florida Board of Governors. As we take these steps and advance our plans over the summer, we pledge to keep you informed and communicate updates when we have more information. We value your input as part of this process. Faculty and staff will soon receive surveys to gauge your opinions about returning to campus. We’ve taken similar measures with students and we hope to gather more feedback to understand your experiences and the factors important to you. As we move forward, we know that COVID-19 will continue to present unique challenges and all of us must be prepared to show the same adaptability and flexibility that we’ve demonstrated over the past several months. Our framework for returning to campus will include following the guidelines set by local, state and federal governments while also constantly monitoring COVID-19 data for our campuses and surrounding communities to address any issues proactively. I wish to express my gratitude to all of you for your patience and resiliency as we navigate this global crisis together. While life on campus will look different in the fall, our creativity and innovative way of thinking will allow us to maintain a sense of community and emerge stronger than ever. Sincerely, Steven C.

T_A&M_U,28-Feb-2020,"February 28, 2020, 5:45 p.m. CST Dear Texas A&M community, Out of an abundance of caution, the University is canceling Spring Break trips to Italy for Texas A&M Education Abroad programs after authorities recommended travelers self-quarantine for two weeks. University leaders are following developments regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19, and will keep our campus community informed. Any students, faculty and staff traveling to Italy or any other country considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be a level 3 risk for coronavirus are required to follow the guidelines to self-quarantine for two weeks, and not return to campus unless they are asymptomatic for that period. The level 3 warning urges people to avoid nonessential travel if the destination is an affected area. China and South Korea already were categorized as being at level 3, which put them on Texas A&M’s suspend-all-travel list. Aggieland low risk Please keep in mind that while COVID-19 is an epidemic in some parts of the world, the Department of State Health Services says that Texas is considered to be at low risk. Closer to home, the Brazos County Health Department considers Aggieland to be at low risk as well. At this time, the CDC and World Health Organization are not recommending canceling or postponing other worldwide travel. Therefore, the university is not canceling any other Education Abroad programs already underway or for those planning other trips over Spring Break. In the coming weeks, Texas A&M will arrange to refund trip costs for the approximately 30 students and faculty who planned to study abroad in Italy over Spring Break. Those impacted by this decision who need to make alternate housing arrangements over Spring Break, along with students who have questions related to the Education Abroad program, can email ea-covid19@tamu.edu. A&M planning well underway Texas A&M University is more than a month into planning for responding to whatever might come our way. A team of university officials continues to constantly monitor the outbreak of the fast-spreading respiratory illness worldwide. To assess potential risks related to the illness, the university is working with governmental agencies, professional health and security organizations, our academic partners and others. Texas A&M strongly recommends that everyone reconsider even personal travel to any country with a level 3 advisory based on the novel coronavirus. For countries at level 2 and 3, travelers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to campus. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites. Students who are traveling should, in addition to taking recommended measures to prevent getting sick, take basic precautions to prepare for potential travel disruptions. We will need your help. A few easy things we can all do include: Wash your hands for 20 seconds Use hand sanitizer Avoid shaking hands  Disinfect frequently touched objects using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe stay home when you are sick and avoid close contact with those who are sick Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Texas A&M will continue to work with federal, state and local officials to monitor potential risks. If conditions change, we will update our campus community. Please check A&M Student Health Services website for updated information.

To that end, today’s update relates to our students, faculty, staff and visitors who have visited areas affected by COVID-19, or the coronavirus. To date, no such cases have been reported in Brazos County, which is home to Aggieland. As we carefully track the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Levels 1, 2 and 3 risk assessment for COVID-19, we are now implementing guidelines consistent with direction from The Texas A&M University System. Our regular updates can be found on the Texas A&M coronavirus page, also found on a button on the tamu.edu home page. As of March 2, 2020, the following countries are categorized as Level 1, 2 and 3 countries: Level 3: China, Iran, Italy and South Korea Level 2: Japan Level 1: Hong Kong Guidance on Returning to the United States Texas A&M-sponsored student groups currently returning from Level 2 or 3 countries should follow CDC guidelines by self-isolating at their family home or off-campus residence for 14 days. Should symptoms occur, seek immediate medical attention. Any student, faculty, staff or visitor traveling from or through Level 2 or Level 3 countries must self-isolate for a minimum of 14 days before returning to the Texas A&M campus.

For faculty and staff, only mission-critical travel to countries Level 1 or above will be considered and will require prior high-level institutional approval. Ongoing Actions To ensure the safety and security of Texas A&M students, faculty and staff, we are doing the following: We are sharing information with local, regional and state public health authorities and the Texas A&M University System administration to ensure the appropriate exchange and notification of timely information. Spring Break and personal travel: Texas A&M does not set requirements for personal travel, but we are strongly urging people to not travel to areas with active community transmission and/or Level 1, 2 or 3 countries. All travelers are encouraged to check the CDC’s COVID-19 travel page, State Department travel advisories, and the International Air Transport Association’s list of travel and entry restrictions for the latest information before departing. Regardless of personal or professional travel, all individuals visiting Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to undergo the 14-day self-isolation period before returning to campus. Note that if you leave the country, your trip may affect your ability to return to the United States and campus. During the 14 days of self-isolation, students should contact Student Health Services for updated guidance and requirements prior to returning to school or work. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation and it is difficult to anticipate what the future may hold. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites. Students who are traveling should, in addition to taking recommended measures to prevent getting sick, take basic precautions to prepare for potential travel disruptions. A few easy things we can all do include: Wash your hands for 20 seconds Use hand sanitizer Avoid shaking hands Disinfect frequently touched objects using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe Stay home when you are sick and avoid close contact with those who are sick Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

T_A&M_U,3-Mar-2020,"March 3, 2020, 5:45 p.m. CST Texas A&M continues to monitor the spread of the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, as more cases are confirmed in the United States and other countries. We continue to use the best advice and guidance available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and the Texas Department of State Health Services. Texas A&M leadership from across the university is meeting regularly to discuss and review the rapidly evolving situation regarding the spread of COVID-19. We have activated the emergency operations plan and convened our response team to coordinate preparedness and response activities. At this time, no one within our campus community has tested positive for COVID-19. Nevertheless, we want to make sure our community is informed and follows preventative measures. Emergency Management on Campus The university is relying on local and state health officials, as well as members of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, Centers for Disease and Preparedness and the World Health Organization, to ensure a consistent and coordinated response. The university also is working with The Texas A&M University System and other institutions of higher education to ensure that issues related to campus communities are appropriately addressed. Administration leaders are actively planning for a range of scenarios and potential short- and longer-term impacts, with particular focus on the health and well-being of the university community, as well as on the continuity of university operations. Despite the rapidly changing nature of this situation, we are prepared to respond as necessary, including the activation of the university’s business continuity plan, which accounts for issues involving employment and instruction of our students. Student Health Services and the Departments of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs, along with many campus partners, all are paying close attention to this situation. Travel Advisory Update As we carefully track the CDC’s risk assessment for COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines consistent with direction from The Texas A&M University System. Our regular updates can be found on the Texas A&M coronavirus page, also found on a button on the tamu.edu home page. As of March 3, 2020, the following are categorized by the CDC as Level 1, 2 and 3 countries: Level 3 COVID-19: China, Iran, Italy and South Korea Level 2 COVID-19: Japan Level 1 COVID-19: Hong Kong Guidance on Leaving & Returning to the United States All Texas A&M students, faculty, staff or visitors traveling to, from or through Level 2 or 3 COVID-19 risk countries must remain at their family home or off-campus residence for a minimum of 14 days before returning to the A&M campus. We highly recommend following CDC guidelines to self-isolate during this period. Should symptoms occur, seek immediate medical attention. Guidance for International Travel Texas A&M University-sponsored student education abroad spring programs for CDC-labeled Level 1, 2 and 3 COVID-19 countries have been cancelled. Other programs are scheduled to continue and will follow the same protocol should those countries move into any of these categories. For other countries, programs will be discontinued if the threat level increases. For faculty and staff, mission-critical travel to countries Level 1 or above will require high-level institutional approval prior to departure. What Does it Mean to Self-Isolate? If you are not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 and are asked to self-isolate after returning from a country listed on the CDC’s COVID-19 travel advisories page as Level 2 or Level 3, you should stay home — in your room, your apartment, or your house. Do not go to campus including work, classes, athletic events or other social gatherings until 14 days after leaving the Level 2 or 3 country in question. Likewise, avoid public places and gatherings in the community. Please follow these guidelines for self-isolation: Report any symptoms of COVID-19 immediately to your medical provider – preferably by calling to get advice and instructions. Texas A&M students and international visiting scholars may call (979) 458-8300. For after-hours contact/inquiries, call the Dial-a-Nurse program at (979) 458-8379. Stay in your room or apartment. Do not go to work, classes, athletic events, or other social or religious gatherings until 14 days after your return to the United States from the country in question. Limit contact as much as possible. This also means limiting close contact with others including persons living in your residence. Wash your hands with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs after coughing or sneezing or throwing a used tissue in the garbage. Avoid sharing household items. Do not share drinking glasses, towels, eating utensils, bedding, or any other items until you are no longer asked to self-isolate. Keep your surroundings clean. While the virus is not spread very well from contact with soiled household surfaces, try to clean surfaces that you share with others, such as door knobs, telephones, and bathroom surfaces (or any other object that you sneeze or cough on), with a standard household disinfectant wipe. Wash your hands after cleaning the area. Monitor yourself for symptoms at least daily including measuring your temperature. Any symptoms of COVID-19 should be reported to your physician. Cover coughs and sneezes with your upper sleeve or a tissue. Never cough in the direction of someone else. How to Protect Myself Stay educated on the disease by reading the CDC website. Most people who become infected experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of yourself by following recommendations from the CDC: Stay home if you don’t feel well. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance before arriving at a medical facility. Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water for 20 seconds. This helps kill viruses that might be on your hand. Stay at least three feet away from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow good respiratory hygiene, which means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the tissue immediately.

Student workers are permitted to work in person on campus provided that the department for which they work implements appropriate social distancing requirements and other safety measures. We recommend that departments be creative in identifying mechanisms to allow student workers to work remotely with the provision that appropriate duties can be assigned and that the department has mechanisms in place to monitor that work. Student workers should contact their supervisor regarding their ability to work. Students feeling ill should not come to work and should self-monitor and seek medical care if needed. Students not ill and not wishing to work in person will not be required to do so and will continue to be paid only if remote work is a possibility per above and approved by their supervisor. If students are unable to work in person or remotely, the student will not be paid. Departments are encouraged to provide as much flexibility regarding duties as feasible. Sincerely, Carol A.

As a result of the increased health screening upon arrival at these airports, and as these airports are experiencing long delays and large volumes of traffic clearing customs and health screening, any international traveler arriving at these airports (listed below) – be it coming from a Level 3 or other country – from Saturday March 14 onward will have an increased chance of exposure than other travelers. Therefore, any faculty, staff and students returning from international travel on or after March 14 and arriving in-country to clear customs at the Boston (BOS), Miami (MIA), New York City (JFK), Chicago (ORD), San Francisco (SFO), Seattle (SEA), Los Angeles (LAX), Atlanta (ATL), Honolulu (HNL), Newark (EWR), Dallas (DFW), Detroit (DTW) or Washington, D.C. (IAD) international airports should consider themselves as having returned from a Level 3 COVID-19 location and self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival before returning to campus. Self-isolation guidance is listed in Frequently Asked Questions section of this web page and on the CDC Care Guide. Domestic travelers through all airports and international travelers from non-level 3 countries arriving at airports other than those listed are required only to self-monitor at this time.

T_A&M_U,17-Mar-2020,"March 17, 2020, 4:00 p.m. CDT Due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on event sizes announced by the White House, Spring graduation ceremonies will be postponed. The university is planning mail delivery of diplomas to graduates (with normal shipping costs waived) and is also considering opportunities for in-person ceremony options later this summer for those May graduates wishing to do so. There is no impact at this time to August in-person graduation ceremonies. Three other major decisions made today include the following: Final exams will not be taken in person. Online testing and other mechanisms for the assessment of student learning are under consideration in collaboration with college deans and faculty and will be announced in the near future. Family Weekend, a 101-year-old tradition filled with dozens of events scheduled for April has also been canceled. The Campus Muster Committee announced that the campus Muster Ceremony would not be held in its traditional in-person format in Reed Arena. The Muster Committee is working closely with The Association of Former Students to provide guidance to the campus and the entire Aggie Network. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic last week, prompting Brazos County, the State of Texas and the federal government to declare a public health emergency. Meanwhile, the White House advised Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The Association of Former Students announced earlier today that Aggie Ring Day scheduled for April has been canceled. Alternate plans were sent to recipients through an email notification. Students will be able to have their ring mailed to them or they can pick it up at the Williams Alumni Center after Texas A&M resumes normal operations. President Michael K. Young said that leaders at the university recognize how the cancellations and changes associated with the virus have created uncertainty and disappointment. ""These are very difficult decisions made with careful thought and input from faculty, staff and students,"" Young said. ""Around the world and here in Aggieland, the unprecedented disruption and sprawling impact of the pandemic are unfolding at a precious time for our university — graduation, finals, major events. And at the same time, we know that most essential is preserving health and safety and continuing to support ongoing education online."" ""Aggies always rise to the occasion and I’m confident we will do so in this situation,"" he said. ""We need to take care of each other, support one another and together we will find our way through.""

T_A&M_U,19-Mar-2020,"March 19, 2020, 4:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and Aggie Network, Our nation, state and we here at Texas A&M University face serious challenges from this global pandemic. This extraordinary situation with COVID-19 coronavirus requires applying everything we are as Aggies – leadership, loyalty, integrity, excellence, respect for each other, and, of course, selfless service – to navigate daily challenges. During this moment of uncertainty, I understand the stress and anxiety many may feel. And yet, I have great faith in our Aggie community. We will get through this together and demonstrate again Aggies’ capacity to surmount every challenge. Just today, Brazos County Health District reported that one of our students in Brazos County tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling to New York. We have confirmed that the student was not on campus after travelling to New York. We send our best wishes for recovery and are supporting our student and the health authorities. There are no other known cases among Texas A&M students, faculty and staff at this time. We continue to monitor developments and will keep you apprised. Like many of you, in addition to concern for all who may face such a diagnosis, I am deeply disappointed that circumstances have forced us to postpone or adjust so many of our timeless traditions. I think of the thousands of students whose hearts were set on walking across the stage to receive their diplomas in May. I think of those who were looking forward to honoring a loved one in person here at Muster. Of dozens of events related to the 101-year-old Family Weekend tradition. And I think of those who dreamed of proudly receiving their Aggie ring, surrounded by family and friends at the Haynes Ring Plaza. In recent days, I am reminded that these are not the only traditions that define us. So too does the character that the absence of these beloved events reveals inside us. As we continue to monitor the best ways to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic pandemic, I am sincerely grateful for everyone helping us address our two highest priorities. First of all, I would like to thank all of those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff at our campuses in Texas, at our Qatar campus, and in support of our education abroad programs around the world. Our spirit of collaboration and compassion has been on full display as we continue to work diligently to assist students who have been impacted by our current state of affairs. Secondly, I want to recognize the large contingent of faculty and staff who are helping us keep our core educational mission intact as much as possible by making the transition to online classes, further protecting the wellbeing of our campuses and local communities. I would like to offer a few words about our operations as we are set to resume all classes next week online. We’ve seen a lot of campus closures across the nation. We remain open as circumstances allow with a full commitment to protecting the safety and educational environment for students who choose to come back to our campuses, as well as faculty and staff. On our campuses, this translates to remote work where possible for faculty and staff while core on-campus services continue. The “new normal” for the time being includes a number of adjustments: online instruction, as well as online support, including counseling and advising, take-away-only dining and limited transportation with social distancing throughout all campus facilities. While many of our students have returned or have chosen to stay at their homes elsewhere, those on our campuses will experience modified services to ensure safety and a productive learning environment. We encourage students and their families to determine the best choice themselves, be it in their homes or on one of our Texas campuses. Our collective efforts have helped us respond to COVID-19 challenges as they arise, and we are also mindful that new developments and recommendations are constantly emerging, which is why we’ve created a central website for coronavirus updates  across a range of relevant topics. As you all know, circumstances change on a rapid basis. I encourage you to visit the site often for the latest updates. Although what we are undergoing now is certainly not part of the common Texas A&M educational experience, it’s not entirely unprecedented. More than 100 years ago, in response to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, university activities were dramatically modified. Aggies learned then the lessons about dedication, resilience and service. And again today, this situation teaches us lessons of perseverance, innovation, compassion and loyalty to our communities, our state, our nation and our world. With gratitude for all you’re doing and great appreciation for the privilege I have of being part of the Aggie community, I thank you for your patience and understanding as we get through this together.

T_A&M_U,21-Mar-2020,"March 21, 2020, 1:20 p.m. CDT Temporary Changes to Grading, Q-Drop and Withdrawal Deadlines Sent on behalf of President Michael K. Young and Provost and Executive Vice President Carol A. Fierke Upon a recommendation from the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and approved by President Young, students will have the opportunity to choose Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for any course in which they are enrolled in the spring semester 2020. Students have until 5pm on Tuesday, April 28th to make changes to their grading options. Details of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee’s proposal are outlined below. Additional guidance to students on how to opt-in to S/U grading will be provided next week. This may not be applicable to students in first professional degree programs who should contact their program for grading information. In addition to the S/U grading, the Q-drop and Withdrawal deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. on Friday, April 24th. Q-drops after Spring Break will not count toward the institutional limit of 4 nor the state limit on drops. Any student considering the change from graded to S/U grading may need to consult with an academic advisor, professional school advisor, athletics advisor, or financial aid advisor to understand the implications of the change on one’s future plans including progress toward a degree or financial aid. Finally, the Faculty Senate Executive Committee is asking faculty to ensure that students have ample opportunity to engage with them during this shift to online instruction. We would like to thank the Faculty Senate Executive Committee for their work and deliberation on these important matters. FULL TEXT OF FACULTY SENATE RECOMMENDATIONS The Faculty Senate Executive Committee met on March 18, 2020 to discuss options surrounding issues of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading this semester. The recommendations of the Faculty Senate on this issue are: Retain the course’s current grading scheme as the default (e.g., Letter grade: A, B, C, D, or F). Students may choose an S/U grading scheme on a course-by-course basis for the spring 2020 semester. All programs that normally require a course for a letter grade must accept S/U grades for all courses this semester. Students will be allowed to switch to S/U Grading until the last day of classes by 5 p.m. on April 28th. Students are strongly advised to talk with their academic advisor before switching any course to S/U grading. If a student is currently not making satisfactory academic progress for financial aid and is on an academic plan, those students should consult with a financial aid advisor prior to switching any course to S/U grading. The S/U grading will adhere to its current Definition in Student Rule 10 (Student Rule 10; “S: Satisfactory (C or above, hours not included in GPA, U: Unsatisfactory (D or F), no grade points, hours included in GPA), except as noted in number 7 below. Any U or F grade received this semester will be removed from GPA computations. S/U grading applies to both Undergraduates and Graduate Students. Similarly, the Executive Committee also recommends the University consider: Extending the Q-drop deadline until April 24th. Q-drops requested after Spring Break will not be added to the student’s cumulative Q-Drop total. Extending the withdrawal deadline to 5 p.m. on April 24th. The Faculty Senate Executive Committee also makes the following recommendation regarding Instructional office hours this semester: The Faculty Senate Executive Committee believes it is the responsibility of all Faculty and Instructors of Record to ensure that all students have adequate access to their instructors during this unique semester. Therefore, we implore every Instructor of Record to ensure that they are holding frequent, potentially extended, and published office hours. This published information, disseminated to their students, should include specific details on the instructor’s preferred method of communication, and how, where, and when that instructor can be contacted.",631,tex,3

In a matter of days, your heroic efforts have helped us fundamentally change everything we do – from educating our students, to conducting research, to maintaining essential business operations. During this challenging time, you have shown us the true character of our university community. Aggies never shrink from a challenge, they always rise to the occasion – with decisive action, inspiring innovation and remarkable determination. As faculty members, you have demonstrated your incredible care for and commitment to our students. Although circumstances have dramatically altered your plans for research and teaching, you have stepped up at an important moment. You have shared your collective wisdom and resources with colleagues across the university, working rapidly and tirelessly to rewrite syllabi and take all of our educational efforts online. I know how meaningful your efforts are for our students, and I want you to know how much all of us appreciate your hard work. I also want to thank and recognize the dedication of our exceptional staff across the university. At a time of great need, you have stepped forward with flexibility, resiliency and resolve. In addition to keeping our campus clean and safe, you are providing the entire IT infrastructure that is making all of our endeavors possible – from online classes, to Zoom meetings, to keeping our Learning Management System running smoothly. In only days you have set up both the TAMU Keep Teaching site to help faculty get connected quickly with resources as well as the TAMU Keep Learning site to help students do the same. You have also conducted most of the 1,342 technology trainings centrally, as well as countless sessions in our colleges and departments. The Central TAMU COVID-19 site that provides a centralized hub for updates and resources has been viewed more than 325,000 times. As we move so many services online, we know the process won’t be perfect. There will be challenges that will arise and things that may not work as planned. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we do our best to maintain the very highest quality of education and research, as well as ensure the health and safety of everyone at Texas A&M. For many members of our university community, this has been a demanding time. So many of you have worked round-the-clock, night and day, without rest or relief. You have had to adjust work schedules and find new solutions for childcare. While words may be of little comfort, I want you to know this. We all see your efforts. We appreciate all of your contributions. And we are all truly grateful for your extraordinary service. Thank you for your support and your continued commitment as we work together to keep everyone safe and carry out our educational mission. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",496,tex,3
T_A&M_U,23-Mar-2020,"Update: March 23, 2020, 6 p.m. CDT At 4:30 p.m. March 23, Brazos County Judge Duane Peters, along with the mayors of Bryan and College Station, ordered individuals to shelter at their place of residence beginning at 9 p.m. Tuesday, March 24 for two weeks. This does not preclude students from leaving campus to travel home or to travel to essential activities (obtaining food, healthcare and medical supplies) or exercising outside with social distancing of six feet or more. For the full order, go here. March 23, 2020, 3:00 p.m. CDT Students, Yesterday, Governor Abbott held a news conference to brief on measures that he and other state leaders are taking to help slow the spread of COVID-19, including not leaving home unless necessary. He did not order a state-wide shelter in place of residence to allow counties the option to do so on a county-by-county basis. Given that Dallas and McLennan Counties have announced their own shelter in place of residence orders, and others may follow suit very soon, all students may want to consider returning to their family home residences. For those in need of housing, you may remain in on-campus housing and should be prepared to shelter in place if the order follows for our College Station and/or Galveston campuses. We will of course continue dining take-out, medical and other essential services, and academic affairs support has already moved online. On-campus students choosing to depart may utilize an “Express Check-Out” option with Residence Life to allow for an orderly move of belongings. Students who have been dwelling in their family homes but retained on-campus housing and wish to check out may also coordinate with Residence Life on arranging to pick up their belongings at some point this semester. The Texas A&M System is reviewing dining and housing credit or refund options and will provide guidance in the very near future. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we do all we can to support Aggies, especially those who may not have other housing and dining options. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",345,tex,3
T_A&M_U,24-Mar-2020,"March 24, 2020, 12:00 p.m. CDT Campus Credits/Refund Message Texas A&M University is pleased to provide the following options to students for prorated credits for housing and dining as follows. Refunds for parking have been included in FAQs on the TAMU COVID-19 website and will be handled under normal procedures, found at: https://transport.tamu.edu/parking.aspx. For those considering departure from on-campus housing this spring given the pandemic, you may do so anytime between now and the end of the semester, May 9, by coordinating with Residence Life, to include social distancing as required when arranging for check-out. Housing (Residence Halls, Corps of Cadets, and White Creek): For residents canceling their housing contract, removing their belongings, and returning their key prior to March 24, 2020, room rent refunds or credits will be based on the number of nights between March 24 and the end of the contract term, May 9.  For residents canceling their housing contract, removing their belongings, and returning their key after March 24, room rent refunds or credits will be based on the number of nights between the date of check-out and the end of the contract term, May 9. Individuals who have questions about this process should contact Residence Life: 888-451-3896 or 979-845-4744 or https://reslife.tamu.edu/on-campus-housing-update/ Housing (Gardens Apartments): For residents canceling their 2019-2020 Gardens contract, beginning March 24, rent and electric charges will end on the day the key is returned to the office or key drop box at the north entrance of the community center. There will be no penalties for failure to give full notice and early cancellation from March 24 through May 22 (or July 31 if a 12-month contract). Dining: Students who wish to receive a refund (or credit) for dining must apply at https://fda.tamu.edu/diningcredit; the students’ dining privileges will be suspended the business day following their application. This refund (or credit) will be calculated based upon the total amount of unused dining dollars and a prorated amount for meal plans based on the length of time between the business day following their application and May 9, 2020. For either Housing (other than Gardens Apartments) or Dining, students may choose to either apply any prorated amounts as a credit to their Fall 2020 student fees or receive a direct refund. The amount of any refund will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s fee account, with any remainder refunded via direct deposit. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",406,tex,3
T_A&M_U,24-Mar-2020,"Impact of Shelter in Place of Residence March 24, 2020, 2:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: These rapid succession of updates are necessary today as we respond to the Brazos County deadline shelter in place of residence order and I ask you to review carefully. Any updates will continue to be housed on the COVID-19 TAMU site. Galveston and other campuses will also issue guidance specific to their locations in line with the information below. Here are some important things you need to know about how the shelter in place of residence order affects the University: Faculty and staff should telework unless deemed essential to be on campus. All non-essential university offices will limit face-to-face interactions and move to virtual support to the general public at 5 p.m. today. All building entrances will revert to controlled access for faculty, staff, and students. We ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss any required on-campus staffing for your office. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Essential on-campus services will continue in support of students, faculty and staff. Even in a telework environment with few on-campus personnel, it is important that we continue to provide limited, yet essential on-campus services in support of students, faculty, and staff. For students, this includes on-campus housing, food service, and student health service as well as limited transportation to and from campus and restricted areas for computing labs and accessing wireless internet. All of these activities must be carried out using social distancing practices. Please see keeplearning.tamu.edu site and the main COVID-19 TAMU site for updates on available student services and hours of operation. Guidance to Faculty and Graduate Students and Continuity of Instruction: For faculty and graduate students who are teaching or supporting instruction, one essential priority is to continue our crucial online course instruction and activities needed to support teaching that will remain online at least through the end of the spring semester. We encourage faculty and graduate students who are teaching courses to develop methods that allow for the continuation of instruction that minimizes time on campus. Those individuals who need campus facilities to teach an online course can contact their respective department head for details on access.  Please refer to keepteaching.tamu.edu site for additional teaching resources. Staff Guidance: For staff, we ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss the expectations of your work arrangements. Please refer to earlier e-mails on the Human Resources web site on instructions for continuing work assignments. Ongoing Critical Services: Critical aspects of our business operations are considered essential under the orders and these will continue. These include but are not limited to: health services, food services that are available to-go, emergency responders, public safety, mail services, residence halls, janitorial and maintenance services, technology support, financial services, essential transportation services, airport, construction where approved, utilities and scientific research. Ongoing Research: Regarding ongoing scientific research, the Office of Research provides the following guidance: To the extent possible, Texas A&M researchers are encouraged to engage in activities that can be performed remotely (e.g., writing, data analysis, etc.); essential laboratory operations are permissible, provided they can be performed while meeting the “6-feet” requirement for social distancing. Graduate researchers may come to the research labs to conduct research activities that cannot be performed remotely. Paid undergraduate student workers may continue to carry out important support functions necessary for continuing laboratory operation. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Please seevpr.tamu.edu/covid-19 for additional information. Students must comply with applicable local government orders. In most cases, the orders allow students to leave their residence only for essential activities, such as going to the grocery store or picking up to-go meals on campus or from restaurants, visiting a healthcare professional and engaging in outdoor activity, such as walking, hiking, running, or riding a bicycle, with proper social distancing.  Students may also leave to go to university-designated locations for accessing computers and internet resources as indicated on keeplearning.tamu.edu. Please consult the central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. Student Health Including Counseling. For student counseling and student health, please refer to information provided by the Division of Student Affairs. Main Campus University Libraries will be closed to walk-in traffic. However, library personnel will continue digitizing resources to support online teaching. Access to all of the libraries’ digital resources and online research support will continue uninterrupted. We will continue to share information and updates by email, social media and on our central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. These are clearly difficult circumstances for everyone. We deeply appreciate the level of commitment of our faculty, staff and students in these challenging times. Michael K.

T_A&M_U,25-Mar-2020,"March 25, 2020, 3:30 p.m. CDT Welcome back to classes this week! Dear Students, I would like to welcome everyone resuming classes at Texas A&M this week in a “new normal” online. Given the recent shelter in place at residence order from Brazos, Galveston and other counties impacting our campuses and sites, I also want to thank you for your tremendous patience and understanding during this challenging time. I was honored to be invited to join yesterday’s Facebook Live Virtual Town Hall Meeting hosted by Student body President Mikey Jaillet and Student body President-elect Eric Mendoza. Other senior university leaders and myself appreciated the engagement and opportunity to address what is on your minds as we were ""social distanced"" across multiple studios at KAMU and another building! As we continue to respond to new updates, I want to assure you that our top priority is your health and safety. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our faculty and staff, we have made major adjustments to bring everything online, greatly reducing the risk you face during this historic pandemic. For those who needed to return to our campuses, we have taken extensive measures to ensure your safety, with some buildings offering monitors to promote social distancing and all of our facilities providing enhanced procedures to promote public health. As new developments emerge, please visit the TAMU Central COVID-19 Website for coronavirus-related updates across a wide range of relevant topics. Campus remains open, but with classes moving online many of you have decided to stay home. To that end, all of our academic and support services are, to the extent possible, available virtually. I encourage you to visit the Keep Learning site for ongoing updates. For those of you who have decided to stay on campus, we will continue to provide essential services such as grab-and-go dining. Bus transportation will be available on campus, with limited passengers to ensure social distancing. Campus ATMs remain in operation. Please consult the central site or the Keep Learning site for building hours, as some academic buildings will remain accessible only for those who have key card access and will close by 5:00 p.m. Yesterday we were delighted to announce credits or refunds for on-campus housing, dining and parking for those who will no longer use these services this spring. While online classes have gone well so far, please understand that everything will not be perfect. During this unprecedented moment in our nation’s history, our faculty and staff have made enormous efforts to continue your education. However, there may still be logistical challenges that arise, and we may need to make changes to enhance your experience. As we get through this together, I want to assure you that Aggies will continue to learn and graduate from Texas A&M, moving on to engage in extraordinary acts of service to our state, our nation and world just as they have for more than 140 years. Thank you for your patience and understanding, and for making us all proud to say you are students at Texas A&M. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",513,tex,3

In an effort to help students, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level. For distance education degree programs with a program fee, there is no change in how they will be charged. At this time, we are planning for traditional, face-to-face delivery in the second summer term with a back-up plan for online delivery depending on the length of the current situation.  We will communicate final plans for the second summer session early enough for individuals to plan accordingly. Additionally, we are working to ensure we have a robust variety of summer coursework needed to make progress toward your degree. Registration begins March 30 and will continue as scheduled.

T_A&M_U,26-Mar-2020,"March 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. CDT Howdy Ags, As loyal members of the Texas A&M community, I wanted you to have the latest information about our response to the coronavirus situation, which you can find in great detail at the Central TAMU COVID-19 site. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff – just as your highest priority is the wellbeing of your families and friends. At the same time, we are always dedicated to providing the very best educational opportunities under even the most challenging circumstances. To this end, our faculty and staff have made impressive efforts to quickly bring every one of our classes and all of our support services online, helping us protect every member of our academic community while providing the highest quality education we possibly can. If you’re interested in learning more, we’ve created a superb TAMU Keep Learning website to ensure our students’ continued success. In light of our capacity to support their education wherever they are located, many of our students have chosen to return home. We have a number of students for whom campus is their primary residence, and others who have chosen to remain on campus because that is the best alternative for their families and their education. To accommodate and support the continued success of those students, we are keeping our campuses and dorms open while taking extensive measures to ensure everyone’s safety, providing monitors for some buildings to promote social distancing and enhanced procedures to promote public health at all of our facilities. Our Student Health Services remain open and actively engaged. Those on campus will still have essential services such as grab-and-go dining, ATM access and bus transportation with social distancing. If you have questions about which areas of campus are open or operational, we again refer you to the TAMU Keep Learning site, which can provide you with the most up-to-date information. Like many of you, we’re deeply disappointed that this historic global pandemic has caused us to adjust certain cherished traditions that mean so much to so many Aggies. But I want to assure you that Muster in College Station and graduation ceremonies in May will still happen, just in a different way. We encourage students and families to celebrate with us virtually, keeping the Aggie spirit strong and connected, even as we are separated by distance. For those who do not have an opportunity to participate in graduation ceremonies in May, we are searching for ways to expand our in-person events in August. Our university enjoys one of the strongest networks in the world, and I know the economic pressures many of you face are real. To that end, I want to thank the dedicated leaders and teams at The Association of Former Students, The 12th Man Foundation, and The Texas A&M Foundation for always answering the call when we need them. Finally, because people like you always have a heart to serve and a desire to take care of other Aggies, many of you have contacted me asking how you can help during this difficult time. At the moment, our biggest need is support for our students whose lives have been dramatically disrupted by this unprecedented pandemic. Many face a number of unexpected expenses. Our goal is to help ensure that they can finish their classes, graduate on time, and move to serve our state, our nation and the world. We have now created a relief fund for our students administered by the university. If you’ve been looking for an opportunity to show your support, we would be delighted if you would donate to our student relief fund, which you can find here. During this unprecedented moment, thank you for your steadfast dedication and devotion to Texas A&M. All of us are deeply grateful for your passion for our university and for your compassion for our students. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",654,tex,3
T_A&M_U,1-Apr-2020,"April 1, 2020, 3:50 p.m. CDT Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19 News Site Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and the Aggie Network, In recent weeks, our news feeds have been dominated by stories about the coronavirus (COVID-19). Behind the scenes at Texas A&M, many other stories are unfolding. These are the stories of hope and healing, of triumph over tragedy, of great compassion and selfless service. They are stories of faculty and staff who have risen to the occasion, of scholars and researchers creating innovations – sometimes by the hour – to meet emerging needs, of students who serve, of leading experts providing essential advice, of Aggies going above and beyond the call of duty. Today we launch a new site, Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19, created to house these exceptional stories in one place, to include some featured globally. Many more stories will be added here. You’ll see accounts of nurses graduating early to put their lives on the line so that they might save the lives of others. You’ll read about engineers who’ve designed a method for making protective masks, a mobile clinic transformed from a converted shipping container by creative students, as well as trusted advice about how to keep your loved ones safe and secure. From innovation to virtual engagement, from the economy to our society, from animals and agriculture to government and health, this informative site gives a glimpse of the extraordinary breadth and depth of knowledge and experience that Texas A&M brings to bear during this global pandemic. Texas A&M is a public university. We’re also a major force for the public good. As you read these stories, I hope you’ll take heart in the efforts made by our students, faculty and staff, as well as the comfort in knowing that Aggies always step forward to serve in times of great need.

We had hoped to resume coursework on campus for the second summer session, but with preregistration underway, some uncertainty on the apex of COVID19, and the need for both our students, faculty, and staff to plan, we have decided to move forward with the decision to teach all summer courses online. As we previously announced, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level for all students in traditional degree programs. For students enrolled in distance education degree programs, there is no change in how they will be charged. We continue to work with colleges to ensure that the university offers a robust schedule of summer coursework to ensure that students can make progress toward their degrees.

T_A&M_U,29-Apr-2020,"April 29, 2020, 9:00 a.m. CDT On Monday, Governor Abbott issued three executive orders and announced that he will allow Executive Order GA-14 to expire on April 30, 2020. GA-14 was issued on March 31 and required Texans to stay at home except to access essential services or provide essential services as an employee, or to engage in daily essential activities (e.g. grocery shopping) or certain outdoor activities. In Executive Order GA-18 issued Monday, Governor Abbott allows certain businesses to re-open and operate at limited capacity, such as restaurants, retail stores and movie theaters. The new Executive Order GA-18 still specifies that ""every person in Texas shall, except where necessary to obtain essential services or reopened services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household."" Specifically, the orders do not reduce most guidance for social distancing, gatherings of 10 or more people, personal hygiene or best practice regarding monitoring your personal health. Furthermore, social gatherings and events are still not permitted. OGC has analyzed the three executive orders issued on Monday and does not believe that they will have a significant impact on university operations, given the changes that we have already implemented. Thus, Texas A&M University will continue its current mode of operations until further notice. We will continue to monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our planning as changing conditions may require. At Texas A&M University, instruction, research and operations have already adjusted to previous guidance, as well as our own assessment of public health impacts across our campuses and educational sites. We will be continuing our standing guidance at this time. This includes: Completion of the Spring Semester via remote/online instruction and finals testing; Campuses and educational sites remain closed to visitors through May 31; Campus commencement ceremonies for Spring 2020 are postponed, with individual branch campus or professional schools providing information on their plans for their graduates. More information will be posted on the Texas A&M graduation page; Summer I, Summer II and 10 Week Summer session will all be delivered by remote/online instruction; Youth Camps on Texas A&M campuses and sites remain cancelled through June 30. Decision for July and August youth camps will be announced on or before May 15; A number of university facilities and services remain accessible to authorized personnel until June 1 with additional guidance expected on or before that date; University research operations remain limited, unless previously authorized by exception from Vice President for Research. Additional information about increasing research activity on campus will be forthcoming on or before May 18. Individual faculty and staff guidance issued by your supervisor remain in effect as appropriate and as updated to fit your individual responsibilities. Access will remain available to the workplace for employees, as is the case today, and most employees will continue to work remotely from home. We anticipate bringing more employees back to the workplace in the near future, and expect a phased approach that calls for the return of certain employees as soon as mid-May with other employees returning in June and still others in July or August. To the extent that work from home is possible, it should continue for medically vulnerable individuals and parents with children at home. We continue to monitor guidance from public health authorities, The Texas A&M University System, and The Office of the Governor to ensure appropriate health and safety for our university and communities. We anticipate additional guidance and announcements regarding our university operations no later than June 1. We appreciate your continued efforts to work, teach, learn and operate Texas A&M University in new and different ways at this time. We applaud your efforts which have helped to limit the impacts of COVID-19 and welcome your continued collaboration in the weeks and months to come. Remember to take care of each other, maintain social distancing, stay home if you are ill and practice frequent hand washing! Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",662,tex,4

Thank you! Next week, 10,796 of you are expected to graduate. While spring commencement, as we know, has been postponed, we will mark in a number of special ways the conferral of degrees. This summer, we’re fully online and enrollment is actually up, a sign that you remain undeterred in pursuing your goals. We will advise about plans for August commencement by the end of May. In the fall, our Aggiebound Aggies numbers are also up. While we know online classes are an option if needed, we plan to be fully open and operational, with dedicated faculty and staff leaning into preparing for all the requirements necessary to do so safely across academics, athletics and campus activities. We will continue to keep you updated in detail for plans to open responsibly, and will, of course, follow updated federal, state officials and healthcare guidance that dictate our ability to do so. It’s been quite a semester! We love you and wish you and your families safety and happiness as we continue to move forward together. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President",321,tex,4

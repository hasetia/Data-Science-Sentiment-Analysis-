    "### Background\n",
    "This question is of interest to our group because we are all University of California students living and furthering our education under the circumstances created by COVID-19. We are concerned with how those with authority are handling this pandemic and if there have been appropriate responses to ensure our safety is prioritized. We were led to our hypothesis by our observations of the dates across the nine University of California COVID-19 update websites and how the measured amount of action and panic through word count paralleled the dates of the rate of confirmed cases exponentially rising. This is important because the response of the president, in normal cases, is mirrored by the rest of the nation. In our case, if the UC’s had not taken action right away against the virus, the number of cases in California could have potentially skyrocketed, causing an even larger outbreak within the nation. It is known that the UC schools have taken large precautionary measures in light of COVID-19 through updates to students and staff and a temporary shutdown of in-person attendance. \n",

    "The article, *“From ‘It’s going to disappear’ to ‘WE WILL WIN THIS WAR’ detail how the president’s response to the coronavirus has changed since January”* by Harry Stevens, and Shelly Tan explores some of the statements made by Donald Trump in regards to COVID-19 and show a visualization of the contagion spreading. This article examines the “winding path” of the president’s response to the virus, in his own words. It begins on January 22 with a quote regarding having the infection under control and a single dot to represent the first case in the United States. February 27, there is a quote about the virus disappearing and an increase to 59 dots of confirmed cases on the visualization with 0 reported deaths. By March 29, the screen is covered in dots showing the mass spread of the contagion. This article documents a severe downplay on the seriousness of the virus by president Donald Trump.\n",

    "The data report, *“How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump’s Response”* shows what the majority of the population is worried about during this pandemic. The data shows interesting trends compared to milestones such as the First U.S. Death reported, Trump declaring a national emergency, millions start filing for unemployment, and US deaths surpass 10000. It seems a majority of Americans are more concerned with the US economy as compared to their health, as about 25% more of the population “very” much worried about the US economy once Trump had declared a national emergency on March 13. We may be able to compare or include the data/figure regarding the US populations care for getting to the virus as compared to Trump’s tweets as there is a general upward trend.\n"

    "*Our main hypothesis is that the nine University of California campus update websites were actually reflecting the severity of the virus when compared to official COVID-19 updates using our measurement of words/day. Meanwhile, we believe President Donald Trump’s tweets did not reflect the actual severity. We are making this prediction because of our observations on how fast the virus spread and how we parallel this with President Trump’s tweets, and how we noticed them increasing over time. Meanwhile, the counterpart of this, at the UC, there have been no major outbreaks reported, showing the implementation of adequate measures.* "

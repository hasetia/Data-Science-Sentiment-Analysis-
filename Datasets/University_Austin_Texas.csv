There will be 25 additional summer courses that will include 2,000 seats beyond our usual capacity. Registration will begin April 27.

Leadership is grateful for the hard work of Faculty and Staff since the COVID-19 Crisis began for us in March. Weve experienced both increased costs due to the shifts in how we are teaching and are facing declines in expected future revenue. Because of our current financial outlook, the university is taking a phased financial approach.

In April we implemented a first phase of measures.

Canceled planned 2020-21 centrally funded merit pool

Limited new hires

Limited large expenditures to only essential needs

Now we are moving to second phase:

Revenue-generating units will now be directed to develop new financial plans with the Provost and CFOs offices, to contain costs where needed

Furloughs or permanent reductions in force will be likely for specific units where revenues have declined Will likely include furloughs or permanent reductions in force. Additional information will be provided by departmental leadership to staff members.

Emergency leave was extended, but starting June 1 emergency leave will no longer be an option in most cases and those using emergency leave will need to review work options with units and/or begin using paid-leave accruals

The University of Texas has been through hard times before and weve always come through them with a strengthened sense of purpose and a dedication to our world-changing mission. Leadership thanks you for your understanding and commitment.

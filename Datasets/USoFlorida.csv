27-Jan-20,503,USF,"JANUARY 27, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF students, faculty and staff, If you have been paying attention to world news lately you may have heard about coronavirus emerging in China, with some confirmed cases outside of China (including one in Washington state) linked to travelers. While the Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers this a serious public health concern, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019 coronavirus to the general American public is considered low at this time. To ensure you are informed, USF Student Health Services and our colleagues in USF Health are providing information to help educate you about the virus. To date, China has reported nearly 3,000 confirmed cases of this 2019 coronavirus infection. So far, 81 patients have died, with older age and underlying disease as co-factors. Cases are confirmed outside of China, with all linking to travelers from Wuhan. The first case in the United States, reported in Washington state, was recognized on January 20, 2020. The U.S. has started screening travelers arriving from China at several major airports. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Patients with confirmed 2019 coronavirus infection generally experience a mild respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever cough shortness of breath Symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. If untreated, the virus can cause pneumonia and, in severe cases, even death. HOW DOES IT SPREAD? Person-to-person spread is believed to occur via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. TIPS FOR PREVENTION Prevent the spread of respiratory viruses by following hand and respiratory hygiene and safe food practices: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS Keep in mind that this is the cold and flu season, so don't jump to conclusions that you have the coronavirus because you have the symptoms. If you are sick, make an appointment to see your doctor. Students should contact the following to make an appointment to see our health professionals: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg: Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee: Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you are severely ill and cannot get to SHS or your doctor, call 911 or go to an emergency room at the local hospital. MORE INFORMATION For more information about the coronavirus, visit: Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) World Health Organization (WHO) If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your medical provider.

31-Jan-20,471,USF,"JANUARY 31, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF community, Our University of South Florida leadership team is closely monitoring the latest information related to a novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, but has now spread to other parts of the world, including portions of the United States. At this time, no cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the state of Florida.  University officials have initiated communication, coordination and planning with local health departments using the most up-to-date information from state and federal health organizations. The U.S. Department of State and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now issued guidance advising Americans to avoid travel to China.  As such, out of an abundance of caution, USF is temporarily suspending all university-related travel to China for students and faculty.  No travel to this area will be authorized until further notice. Although no cases have been reported in Florida, USF Health and USF Student Health Services have provided important information about the virus, tips for prevention and other helpful resources.

28-Feb-20,901,USF,"FEBRUARY 28, 2020COMMUNITY Dear USF community, The University of South Florida continues to closely monitor the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority as university leaders work closely with local, state and federal agencies to share the most updated information. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the state of Florida. The following information is intended to help inform travel plans in the coming weeks and provide guidance from USF Health experts. USF World international travel guidance USF will continue to follow guidelines from the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control to assess the risk associated with the international destinations of USF travelers. Please be advised: the current situation is very fluid. Conditions can change rapidly in the country you are visiting and could impact your ability to re-enter the U.S. USF has processes in place to review planned international travel. Student travel to a U.S. Department of State Risk Level 3 or 4 location, or a CDC Level 3 location, is not permitted. Presently, China and South Korea fall into these categories. All student travel to these locations is currently prohibited. Given the current global conditions, USF is suspending all future faculty and staff business travel to U.S. Department of State Risk Level 4 locations, or CDC Level 3 locations until further notice. We expect faculty and staff adhere to travel guidelines determined by university policy and procedure, however deans and supervisors can further limit faculty or staff travel given heightened health and safety concerns. Faculty and staff are encouraged to consult with their dean or designated supervisor prior to scheduling any type of international travel for university business. At this time, all USF spring and summer study abroad programs in locations outside CDC Level 3 Advisory areas remain in place. Should it become necessary to cancel any programs, students and faculty will be contacted immediately. Before you travel, pay attention to the risk levels of any country you are visiting, understanding that risk assessments may change from day to day. Airports worldwide have set up, or are in the process of setting up, health-screening checkpoints for international passengers. At this time, anyone with a fever or other flu-like symptoms should not travel internationally, as they may be detained for further testing and observation. The International Air Transport Association has a continuously updated website for countries around the world that is a valuable resource for travelers. If you are outside the United States and need assistance, contact the USF World 24/7 International Assistance Line +1-813-317-5815 or by email. If you are concerned about the status of a future study abroad program, contact your Education Abroad Program Manager or you may reach out to James Pulos, Associate Director, USF Education Abroad. All students enrolled in education abroad programs have been contacted via email. Please be sure to check your email regularly for important communications. If you are a business traveler with questions about a planned overseas trip, contact Ben Chamberlain, Risk and Security Officer. HEALTH GUIDANCE For the general American public, the immediate health risk is currently low. Nonetheless, there is increasing concern that person-to-person spread will eventually occur more widely in the United States. Keep in mind that this is the cold and flu season, so you should not assume you have the coronavirus even if you have similar symptoms. If you are sick, stay home and make an appointment to see your doctor. Students should contact the following to make an appointment to see our health professionals: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg: Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee: Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you are severely ill and cannot get to a doctor, call 911 or go to an emergency department at a local hospital. If you are returning from a country with coronavirus and you are requested to maintain 14 days of self-isolation, please contact Dr. Joseph Puccio, Executive Director of Student Health Services, at 813-974-0444. PREVENTION It is always a good idea to practice habits that help prevent disease, especially during cold and flu season: Obtain the influenza vaccine if you haven’t already. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Regularly wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, particularly if you have been in contact with someone who is sick. Use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Should the coronavirus evolve to more directly impact the state of Florida or the Tampa Bay region, be assured that USF’s Emergency Management team and our university leadership have plans in place to adequately ensure appropriate response, coordination of resources and continuity of academic and business operations as necessary. For reliable, up-to-date information, visit: Florida Department of Health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention World Health Organization USF has also set up a dedicated website for updated information and resources. Please continue to check usf.edu/coronavirus for details. The health and well-being of our community is of utmost importance.

Continue to check this web page for the most up-to-date information. *NEW INFORMATION AS OF MONDAY, MARCH 2* There have now been two confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida. There is no evidence to suggest that either of these cases has any connection to the USF community at this time. The Governor’s Office has now declared a State of Emergency for Florida, which provides additional guidance for state healthcare professionals. As of this date, the CDC has designated several countries as Risk Level 3. USF prohibits student, faculty and staff travel to these destinations. CDC risk assessments may change from day to day; check back frequently. The Florida Board of Governors has asked universities to cancel all university-sponsored travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea. Per the same communication, all faculty, employees and students who have traveled to these countries are being asked to return home and self-quarantine away from campus for 14 days. Recognizing that our USF community is looking forward to spring break, please be aware that the CDC is cautioning that individuals traveling abroad “may face unpredictable circumstances, travel restrictions, challenges returning home, or accessing health care while abroad.” USF leadership will release more detailed guidance regarding spring break Education Abroad programming in the coming days. PREVENTION AND RESOURCES Protect yourself and your community from COVID-19. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.

11-Mar-20,787,USF,"MARCH 11, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, In light of the continuing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), I wish to share with you some important updates for our university community. These decisions have been informed by official directive from state leaders as we work to maintain the health and wellness of our campus and our communities within the state of Florida. REMOTE INSTRUCTION FOR COURSES As directed by the Florida Board of Governors, we will begin transitioning all of our classes to remote instruction for two weeks following spring break, March 23 through at least April 5. Students traveling for spring break next week should plan to not return to campus for at least two weeks following. Students who had not been planning to travel for spring break should make plans to return home, if possible. Although students are encouraged to remain off campus during this time, residential students who wish to remain in their residence halls may do so. If you have questions or need to make other arrangements, contact Housing and Residential Education at 813-974-0001 or housing@usf.edu. International students and foreign exchange students will receive further guidance from USF World. All classes and necessary support functions will continue remotely. USF has developed a myriad of tools, technologies, training and other resources to assist in this transition. Earlier this week, we rolled out a USF Toolkit for Instructional Continuity for faculty to assist with remote delivery preparations. We have also assembled a USF Toolkit for Continuity of Student Support to facilitate remote student access to important resources and services, such as counseling, advising, tutoring and other needs. While classes are moving to remote delivery, many normal university operations will continue, including Student Health Services, USF Health clinical operations and university administration and staff functions. If you have specific questions about your unit, contact your supervisor. CAMPUS OR UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED EVENTS At this time, all university-sponsored events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus scheduled in the next 30 days must be postponed or canceled. Questions about a particular event should be directed to the appropriate vice president. Athletics events will be addressed in the near future. If you are considering live-streaming or recording events in lieu of offering them in person, please contact IT Services to determine feasibility and costs. Questions on financial impacts resulting from cancellation should be directed to BUSFIN-SRD@usf.edu. Questions on any legal matters can be directed to Gerard Solis at gsolis@usf.edu. These recommendations will be reevaluated on an ongoing basis and new guidance provided as needed. USF EMPLOYEE GUIDANCE At this point, all healthy USF employees are expected to maintain normal work operations, although some adjustments may need to be made on a case-by-case basis. If an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is directed to self-isolate by a medical professional or public health official, the employee should notify their supervisor and follow official guidance for the duration of the isolation period. If anyone in self-isolation can and would like to continue working remotely, they may, with approval of their supervisor. Employees choosing to self-isolate out of concern for their health or the health of others must follow normal work rules, which cover sick leave, vacation or other leave policies. Leave should be requested from their supervisor. In the event that more extensive university closures are required, additional procedures may be developed to cover employees’ time off. Please contact USF Human Resources at 813-974-2970 or Employee-Relations@usf.edu with additional questions. HEALTH GUIDANCE Please continue to sanitize your workstations and personal spaces and continue to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when you are sick. Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. Students who need guidance or medical assistance should contact Student Health Services: Tampa Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 The health and wellness of the USF community is always our first priority. We deeply appreciate your adaptability as we work to respond to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor this situation, using guidance from our partners at the state and national levels, and provide additional updates as they are available.

11-Mar-20,314,USF,"MARCH 11, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY The University of South Florida announced several operational changes on Wednesday, March 11, in light of continuing concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus). The health and wellness of students, faculty and staff is USF’s first priority as university leaders work closely with local, state and federal agencies to monitor the coronavirus. As directed by the Florida Board of Governors, USF will join other state universities in transitioning all classes to remote instruction as soon as possible. For USF, fully remote instruction will begin March 23, following spring break. This will continue through at least April 5. Student support functions, such as counseling and advising, will continue remotely. While classes are moving to remote delivery, USF’s campuses will remain open and many normal university operations will continue, including Student Health Services and USF Health clinical operations. USF residence halls remain open, however, students are encouraged to remain off campus during this time, if other reasonable accommodations are possible. With spring break approaching, we recommend you discuss, as a family, what plans you have if your student is required to self-quarantine for a two-week period for any reason (including illness or travel to an affected area). Your plan should include a possible quarantine location other than a shared living space, such as a residence hall or multi-occupancy apartment. Should your student need to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework. For the next 30 days, all university-sponsored events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus will be postponed or canceled. For details on athletic events, please visit the USF Athletics website for the most up-to-date information. USF will continue to evaluate the situation and new guidance will be provided as needed. The university community and public can continue to check this website for the latest information and resources available"
12-Mar-20,256,USF,"MARCH 12, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF Education Abroad Students on Faculty-Led Programs, I am sure all of you are aware, global concerns over the COVID-19/coronavirus have caused several governments, including our own, to restrict travel. Our students’ health and safety are our priority. Therefore, it is with great regret that we announce the cancelations of USF’s spring and summer faculty-led programming through July 31, 2020. USF will remove all study abroad program costs placed on your student account. We hope to have all of this completed within a 30-day period. Regarding purchased airfare, we recommend that you request a full refund of your airfare or a full credit for future travel from your chosen airline. All major U.S. airlines have now indicated they are willing to either refund the cost of your flight, or award you a full credit for you to use over the next year. Note: Due to the high volume of calls, airlines may not be able to immediately process requests for flights scheduled for later dates. Please be patient with this process. Obtaining a refund may take several weeks. Should you require further guidance, please contact the Education Abroad Gateway Office at (813) 974-5474. We know this news is disappointing. We hope that once the global public health crisis resolves, you will consider traveling abroad through USF again. If you have questions or concerns specific to your program, please contact your program manager directly. Reach out to our main e-mail for general questions or questions about airfare (EducationAbroad@usf.edu). Kind Regards, Education Abroad Office"
13-Mar-20,367,USF,"MARCH 13, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF students, The health and wellness of our community is of our highest priority, and YOU play an important role. As we leave for spring break, our students have been strongly directed not to return to campus until face-to-face classes resume, currently scheduled for April 6. The university took this drastic step with the hope of protecting the entire USF campus and our surrounding community, which includes many vulnerable populations, from the coronavirus. Limiting the numbers of people moving on and off the campus is an important step in reducing the potential for transmission of the COVID-19 virus. If there are students who do not have off-campus alternatives and must return to their residence halls, please be aware that services will be significantly limited, and certain amenities will not be offered, such as: Libraries will be closed. The Marshall Student Center in Tampa will be closed; the University Student Center in St. Petersburg will be open in order to offer limited dining, but there will be no events, social activities or other special services available. All campus recreation facilities and pools on all campuses will be closed. All residence hall lounges and community spaces will be closed. All university events, on or off campus, have been canceled. We will have limited dining hours and options. We will have a limited or suspended Bull-Runner schedule. If you do need to stay on campus, please practice social distancing. Do not put yourself in areas of large groups, and maintain at least 6-10 feet between people. Minimize your activity within and beyond the residence halls. Continue to practice good hygiene. This is a very fluid, dynamic situation. Please understand that the university’s circumstances could change at any time. We will continue to update you as the situation evolves. If you have any questions about your housing needs, please contact: housing@usf.edu for Tampa students or housing@usfsp.edu for St. Petersburg. If you have health-related questions, contact Student Health Services: Tampa: Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 If you have other questions about the university’s response to COVID-19, contact: COVIDquestions@usf.edu."
13-Mar-20,243,USF,"MARCH 13, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, I am writing with an important follow up to my previous communications regarding our responses to the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As you are aware, following a Florida Board of Governors’ directive, we are transitioning all of our classes to remote instruction following Spring Break, beginning Monday March 23 through at least April 5. To support this swift transition, we have developed several critical resources, including a set of Frequently Asked Questions, a Faculty Toolkit for Instructional Continuity, and a Student Toolkit for Continuity of Support. The Frequently Asked Questions provide answers to many of the important questions we have received over the last few days. Please note that this is a living document and will be updated as we work to respond to your questions and the rapidly spreading virus. As a reminder, all courses must be transitioned and ready for remote instructional delivery beginning Monday, March 23. Faculty are provided with training opportunities to help leverage Canvas and other tools for remote instruction. Both face-to-face and live stream sessions will be offered on all three campuses throughout Spring Break. I strongly encourage you to sign-up at your earliest opportunity to ensure timely transition to remote class delivery. Most importantly, I want to thank you for your continuing dedication to the University of South Florida, and especially to the support of our students, during these challenging times. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Executive Vice President"
15-Mar-20,364,USF,"MARCH 15, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, Our leadership team continues to closely monitor the evolving dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our community. As of March 15, the following encompasses the latest guidance from university leadership regarding remote work options. Expect regular updates as the situation evolves. While the university continues to be open and operational, supervisors are being asked to strongly encourage any employees (faculty, staff, OPS) who can work remotely to do so until at least April 6, when face-to-face classes are scheduled to resume. Employees must work with their supervisors to develop a plan that allows them to meet deliverables and maintain communication, productivity and efficiency. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work or who do not have necessary IT resources should talk to their supervisors about designing on- or off-campus work arrangements that will still fulfill their obligations without exposing undue risks to their own health and safety or that of the campus community. Healthcare-delivery employees, including USF Health clinical staff, Student Health Services staff and veterinary staff, are expected to report to work as usual unless they receive separate guidance from their supervisors. Employees whose personal situations prevent them from working, or who choose to self-isolate on their own accord away from work duties, may use one of the following types of time off, with supervisory approval: Accrued annual leave Accrued sick leave (if the employee or family member is ill) Unpaid leave Employees should contact their immediate supervisors as soon as possible once they know they will be unable to report to work to develop a plan. If an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is directed to self-isolate by a medical professional or public health official, the employee should notify their supervisor and follow official guidance for the duration of the isolation period. If anyone in self-isolation can and would like to continue working remotely, they may, with approval of their supervisor.

17-Mar-20,811,USF,"MARCH 17, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, There is nothing more important than the health and wellness of our community as we work to respond to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. It is this belief that guides our every decision, utilizing the latest guidance of our governmental and health leaders. Today, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Board of Governors directed our state universities, including the University of South Florida, to continue providing remote instruction for the duration of the spring semester. This means that, if able, students should make plans to remain off campus until at least May 7. USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) who are able to work remotely should continue to do so until at least April 6, however USF leadership will continue to monitor the situation to provide updated guidance, as needed. Student Health Services and USF Health clinical operations will continue as usual, unless otherwise noted Residential students will receive separate guidance shortly. Commencement is a vital element of our university community and an important milestone in the lives of our students and their families. Per Board of Governors direction, the spring 2020 commencement scheduled for May is postponed until further notice. We understand this is very disappointing to our graduates and their families. This is not a decision we take lightly, and we are working diligently with student leaders to develop creative alternative solutions to give our graduates the recognition they have rightly earned, including the possibility of expanding August ceremonies to include spring graduates. More details will be provided as soon as possible. USF is dedicated to the success of our students. We are also committed to the availability of high-quality online course delivery throughout the summer to ensure academic continuity. REMOTE INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES All classes and necessary support functions will continue remotely through the spring semester. USF has developed a myriad of tools, technologies, training and other resources to assist in this transition. We have now updated both our USF Toolkit for Instructional Continuity for faculty and our USF Toolkit for Continuity of Student Support to facilitate remote student access to important resources and services, such as counseling, advising, tutoring and other needs. Importantly, beginning next week, all students will have access to Microsoft Teams and Office 365, providing an additional resource for collaboration with faculty and student peers. A separate communication will follow shortly with more details from USF IT. CAMPUS EVENTS AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS Per federal guidance, individuals should limit any gatherings of more than 10 people for at least the next two weeks. This means that all face-to-face meetings, organizational gatherings or other social events of this size should be canceled or conducted virtually. All events on campus, at other USF instructional sites or off campus are postponed or canceled until further notice. USF Libraries will also be closed to all visitors (USF faculty, staff, students and the general public) until further notice. Virtual library services will continue for students and faculty. USF EMPLOYEE GUIDANCE Per guidance provided March 15, any USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) who can work remotely should do so until at least April 6. USF leadership will continue to monitor the situation to provide updated guidance, as needed. Employees must work with their supervisors to develop a plan that allows them to meet deliverables and maintain communication, productivity and efficiency. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work or who do not have necessary IT resources should talk to their supervisors about designing on- or off-campus work arrangements that will still fulfill their obligations without exposing undue risks to their own health and safety or that of the campus community. Healthcare-delivery employees, including USF Health clinical staff and Student Health Services staff, are expected to report to work as usual unless they receive separate guidance from their supervisors. For guidance with IT resources visit www.usf.edu/it-remote-resources. Please contact USF Human Resources at 813-974-2970 or Employee-Relations@usf.edu with additional questions. Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. HEALTH GUIDANCE Please continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Take time this weekend to become familiar with your courses on Canvas, how they’re set-up and structured, as well as review any directions from your professors. Email them if you have questions, but please be patient. Your instructors are also adapting to a rapidly changing environment and they are communicating with many other students. When your classes resume, take these steps to ensure academic success: Sign on to Canvas each morning. Monitor professor announcements, emails and assignment updates. Be signed on and ready to learn at your designated class time. Use the Canvas calendar function to see assignment due dates. Utilize faculty online office hours to address your concerns and needs. MICROSOFT TEAMS FOR COLLABORATION To allow for greater collaboration for remote learning, USF is making Microsoft Teams and Office 365 available to you as an added benefit. This access requires a change to your USF email address; therefore, beginning March 23, IT will start rolling out new Office 365 email addresses (@usf.edu) for all students, which will become your primary USF address. Although this replaces your USF Gmail address (@mail.usf.edu), your Gmail address will still be available and will forward any messages to your new Office 365 address. For more information about accessing Microsoft Teams, using your new email address (including setting up your phone), and any related questions, visit www.usf.edu/teams-for-students. INTERNET ACCESS VIA EDUROAM If you live in an area where broadband internet access is difficult, as a USF student, you have access to the national eduroam system. Visit https://incommon.org/eduroam/eduroam-u-s-locator-map/ for a map indicating all the eduroam sites in the U.S. If you can get a wifi signal at any of these sites and your device has already been configured for eduroam, it will automatically connect. Otherwise, simply choose the eduroam network. STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES Although many facilities on our campuses are closed or operating with minimal staffing, USF continues to offer you essential student support services, including tutoring, advising, IT Help Desk, financial aid, registrar, and more. Visit the Student Toolkit online at www.usf.edu/academic-continuity/student-toolkit/ to see what is available and how to access these services. STAY HEALTHY, BULLS To finish this semester strong, you need to stay healthy. Please observe the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and practice social distancing. Even if the virus proves not to be a major threat to your health, getting sick could impact your academic success. Student Health Services is open and ready to serve you, in person or remotely. Their contact information is in the Student Toolkit. Anxiety, social distancing, and the usual end-of-semester stress can take its toll as you hunker down to slow the spread of COVID-19.

21-Mar-20,1000,USF,"MARCH 21, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, As USF’s scheduled Spring break comes to a close and the rapid transition to remote instructional delivery nears, I wanted to take a moment to share how deeply appreciative I am of the tireless dedication you have shown in the face of unprecedented events and the disruption in your lives. Your efforts and accomplishments have been truly inspirational as you strive to prepare to meet the continuing educational needs of our students.  Each day I hear remarkable stories from our academic and student success leadership teams of the sacrifices and commitment exhibited by our faculty members across all three campuses. And special thanks to our colleagues in USF Health who are wrestling daily with the layered complexities associated with continuing clinical care. As we all recognize, in recent weeks, we have found ourselves blown into uncharted waters and we are struggling to navigate our way, fighting unpredictable winds, and currents, with likely storms on the horizon. I understand the anxiety and fear of the unknown that such uncertainty can bring, especially as our lives have been thrown into turmoil and we seek to stay connected with, and support, our loved ones including those at a geographical distance. First, I ask you to take good care of yourselves and your loved ones.  Follow the well-published precautions from the CDC and practice social distancing as you work remotely. Behave as if you have the virus for some of us likely do, and we just don’t know it. Each one of us must do all that we can to limit community spread and “flatten the curve.” Life is precious. Care for yourself and for others. As you search for a glimmer of normalcy in these uncommon times, please stay connected with your loved ones, your students, faculty, and staff colleagues. Look out for one another. For those who find themselves struggling with the impact of social distancing and loneliness, today or tomorrow, you might reach out for counseling support through the USF Employee Assistance Program consider these Tips on Working Remotely along with these Tips and Tricks for Thriving During Self-Isolation. Before we resume class instruction from remote locations, beginning on Monday, March 23, I urge you to review the guidance provided on USF’s official source for information, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) website. While we plan to limit broadcasted messages knowing how inundated your inbox is, we will certainly update you on essential changes as they happen. You will also find helpful guidance in the Faculty Toolkit, the Current Student Toolkit, and on the FAQ page. We anticipate the coming days to be a little “bumpy” for some of our students, faculty, and staff as, collectively, we navigate a new course. Most importantly, I ask that you remain mindful of what your students, faculty and staff colleagues are coping with during these challenging times. Communicate with them regularly, yet please set reasonable expectations for response and be patient. Our students will look to you for calm, clear, concise, consistent, and confident guidance, all sprinkled with a heavy dose of compassion. To be clear, this is not to suggest that we compromise academic integrity, for we must still expect our students to demonstrate mastery of student learning outcomes, albeit, in some cases, in quite different ways. Your students will be looking for your ongoing support outside of the virtual classroom, so please make provision for remote “office hours.” Please be sure to maintain access to your students’ USF email addresses and request their telephone contacts in case one or more of our trusted digital platforms experience an interruption in service. Please remain particularly sensitive to the needs of those students expecting to graduate this semester, for they have already been disappointed by the news that commencement will be postponed. Most importantly, please stay in close contact with your department chair, school director, or college dean. Let them know if you need additional support, and if you are not able to fulfill your instructional assignment. We also know that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about major disruptions in the lives of our faculty that may temporarily prevent or interrupt their scholarly productivity and achievements. This problem is especially acute for those faculty members in their probationary period and who are working towards tenure. Therefore, the university is making available an extension to the tenure-clock by one academic year, for eligible tenure-earning faculty members. This action has been carefully considered, and endorsed by, the faculty senate presidents on all USF campuses, the president of the USF System Faculty Council, all College Deans (across all campuses), leadership of the USF chapter of the United Faculty of Florida, the Senior Vice President for USF Health, the Provost and University President. You can learn more about USF’s extension of the tenure-clock here. With a mind to easing the burden on faculty members, faculty committees, and academic leaders at a time when your rightful focus is on transitioning to remote instructional delivery, we are permitting colleges, schools, and departments to relax their annual faculty evaluation deadlines. Chairs on 12-month appointments (and Deans as appropriate) must complete the process and notify faculty that evaluations are available for review no later than June 5, 2020 (per the USF-UFF CBA). At that time, faculty must review and sign the document. Chairs on 9-month appointments must complete their responsibilities by May 5, 2020. Please know that we continue to monitor developments and will work to support your focus on meeting our students’ needs. As we can all acknowledge, these are not normal times and we should not expect to follow normal practices. Your deans, directors, and chairs, along with the broader academic and student success leadership teams, are here to support you. Please let us know how we can help? Meantime, please do all that you can to stay healthy as, together, we strive to balance the needs of our loved ones, our students, and the broader USF community. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost & Executive Vice President"
24-Mar-20,403,USF,"MARCH 24, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, I know that many of you have been hearing from our students that they are deeply concerned about the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on their academic performance during the current semester. Our primary responsibilities are to care for our students’ health and wellbeing, support their continued academic success, provide a mechanism for students to reduce uncertainty in the short-term and not to prolong and elevate the stress and anxiety they are facing, all while focusing on their achievement of student learning outcomes. For the past week, USF’s Academic and Student Success leadership team, across all campuses, has been developing a thoughtful yet temporary shift in course grading options that will permit students to request a change from the awarding of letter grades to Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) for Spring 2020. Throughout this process, we have consulted with college deans, student leaders, Faculty Senate presidents on all campuses, along with the president of the USF System Faculty Council, and we have sought guidance from SACSCOC and specialized accrediting agencies. This temporary change has been approved unanimously by the aforementioned stakeholders and USF leadership, including the senior vice president for USF Health, the provost, and the president. Because you will have questions, and I’m quite sure you will soon hear from your students, I wanted to provide you with the courtesy of this advanced notice. Tomorrow (Wednesday, March 25), we will share this temporary change in course grading option with our students and post a set of related FAQs for students, faculty and staff, which will provide essential guidance and full details on this matter. The following information will be important for faculty members to understand: Instructors will not need to take any action as students carefully consider well-informed decisions concerning this option. Instructors will continue to submit letter grades for students through Canvas. Faculty members will not know (unless a student informs them) which students in their class(es) have opted for a shift to S/U. For those students choosing this option, the S/U will be awarded based upon letter grade equivalency in the current catalog. This notice will include important guidance on Withdrawal (which we discourage) and Incomplete grades. You will be able to access all details, beginning tomorrow, at the Faculty Toolkit. Meanwhile, thank you again for the dedication that you have shown during these extraordinary times. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Executive Vice President"
25-Mar-20,414,USF,"MARCH 25, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, The University of South Florida is working diligently to monitor the evolving COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, providing you with important updates as they happen. Today we learned that a student from USF Tampa who had been traveling abroad tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to the U.S. This student, who has not been on campus this semester, is self-isolating in another state and will continue to be monitored by health officials. We have also been informed that an employee in USF Innovative Education on the Tampa campus has tested positive for COVID-19. This individual is being monitored by health officials, following guidance established by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The employee has not been on campus since March 13. Students and staff members who may have come into close contact with these individuals are being contacted separately with appropriate health guidance. We sincerely wish both members of our community a full and rapid recovery. As a reminder, students are strongly encouraged to remain off campus for the rest of the spring semester. USF employees (faculty, staff and OPS) should continue to work remotely with supervisor approval until further notice. Students who need guidance or medical assistance should contact Student Health Services: Tampa Student Health Services (SHS100) at 813-974-2331 St. Petersburg Wellness Center (SLC 2200) at 727-873-4422 Sarasota-Manatee Counseling and Wellness Center (5805 Bay Shore Rd.) at 941-487-4254 Faculty and staff who are concerned about their health should contact Dr. Lynette Menezes in USF Health at healthglobal@usf.edu. I would also like to share an update on our future process to notify students, faculty and staff about confirmed cases within the USF community.  We have established a new page of our coronavirus website dedicated to providing information about positive tests. The website will be continually updated as USF is informed of any individuals who test positive.  When USF becomes aware of a confirmed case, we will also reach out to the leadership of a potentially impacted college, department or unit to offer information that can be provided to their constituents. We also encourage you to continue to follow updates on the Florida Department of Health’s website regarding positive testing data by county and across the state. As always, the health and safety of our community is of paramount importance as we work closely with our local, state and federal partners. Sincerely, Steve Currall President and Professor"
26-Mar-20,1909,USF,"MARCH 26, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS APRIL 2, 2020 UPDATE Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order number 20-19 regarding essential services and activities during the COVID-19 emergency effective 12:01 a.m. April 3, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This order requires all persons in Florida to limit movements and personal interactions outside of one’s home to only those necessary to obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities. In accordance with this order, USF has suspended the scheduled move-out period of April 8 –May 10 for students away from campus who had planned to return to campus to retrieve their personal belongings. Read the message sent to residents currently off campus on April 2, 2020. Students currently on campus, besides those approved to remain on campus, have been sent individualized instructions for move-out. Dear USF residents, USF’s highest priority is the health and safety of our community. As the COVID-19 crisis rapidly evolves, and in accordance with guidance from local, state and federal officials, we have important and timely new instructions to share with our on-campus residents. We deeply appreciate your continued patience, cooperation and understanding as we work together to protect our campus and the surrounding community. We have developed the following plan to credit housing charges and complete a safe and orderly move out for those students who are able to do so. As always, we will work with any residential student who does not have another suitable option for housing so that the resident can remain in campus housing. The refunds will initially appear as credits on your Oasis account, and then be refunded to you as described in this plan. In order for the plan to work smoothly, we divided residential students into two categories: (1) those who are physically present on campus at this time and (2) those who are not physically present on campus at this time. Please see the category below that describes your situation for specific instructions. RESIDENTS WHO ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT ON CAMPUS All residents currently residing (physically present) on-campus must vacate their room by noon on Monday, April 6, UNLESS you fall into one of the categories below and obtain approval via the Housing Portal: International students unable to travel or concerned about not being able to return to USF when in person classes resume Residents without permanent housing or who are unable to return home Residents whose guardians are considered higher risk (compromised immunity, pre-existing conditions, positive COVID-19 test or self-isolating) Residents who will not have online access if they return home Residents with other hardships (to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis) Requests for exceptions must be received no later than 9 a.m. on Monday, March 30, by completing the ‘exception to remain on campus’ form in the Housing Portal. You will be notified via email from Housing & Residential Education if you are granted an exception. At noon on Monday, April 6, all student card access to residential buildings will be deactivated UNLESS a student has been approved to stay for the remainder of the semester. The 24-hour desks have adjusted hours to 6 a.m. – 9 p.m. each day. Residents should return their keys during this time period Besides those approved to stay, USF will end all residents’ current housing agreements and issue a credit to their Oasis account for rent from Monday, March 23, through the remainder of their housing agreement. Those residents approved to remain on-campus may need to relocate from their current room to another building or area of campus later in the semester, to be determined; however, their current housing rate will remain the same. RESIDENTS WHO ARE PHYSICALLY OFF CAMPUS AT THIS TIME All students not physically residing on campus as of the date of this message, may not return to campus until they receive an approved move-out date and time (see below). Our intention is to start to allow residents to return to campus and move-out beginning on Wednesday, April 8. All move-outs will be scheduled to be completed by noon on Friday, May 8.

27-Mar-20,604,USF,"MARCH 27, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear USF employees, Thank you for all you are doing to help USF maintain business and academic continuity during this unprecedented time of uncertainty. Our leadership team is committed to proving you with timely updates and important resources as we navigate this challenge together. Over the past week, we have received new guidance from both local officials and the federal government that have implications on our employment practices. This includes new “Safer at Home” ordinances locally, as well as changes to employee paid leave rights at the federal level. “Safer at Home” In light of the significant health risk posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, Pinellas County and Hillsborough County passed a “safer at home” directives, asking all county residents to remain at home except for essential activities such as trips for groceries, medical needs and jobs that are deemed critical. This directive aligns with the March 13 guidance from President Currall, which instructed any USF employees who can work remotely to do so. The Pinellas County order was effective as of Thursday, March 26, at noon. The Hillsborough County order is effective as of Friday, March 27, at midnight. According to the ordinances, essential businesses, which includes state educational institutions like USF, are allowed to continue internal and minimum basic operations as long as they follow the Center for Disease Control’s social distancing guidance (six feet of separation from others and no group gatherings of more than 10). Nevertheless, remote work is preferred if possible, per President Currall’s directive. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work should coordinate with their supervisors to design on- or off-campus work arrangements that fulfill their obligations while complying with CDC social distancing guidance and protecting their health, as well as the health of others. Families First Coronavirus Response Act: Employee Paid Leave Rights The newly passed federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) provides employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. These provisions will apply from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Under these new guidelines, employees are eligible for two weeks of paid sick time for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employees employed for at least 30 days are eligible for up to an additional 10 weeks of paid family leave to care for a child under certain circumstances related to COVID-19. An employee qualifies for paid sick time if the employee is unable to work (or unable to telework) because the employee: is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19; has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19; is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis; is caring for an individual subject to an order described in (1) or self-quarantine as described in (2); is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19; or is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury. Entitlements are subject to whether an employee is full-time and/or part-time, and monetary caps apply. Find additional information and frequently asked questions here. If you have additional questions, and to determine your eligibility under this new act, please contact the Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. The health and safety of our university community remains our first priority, and we appreciate your continued patience, adaptability and understanding."

We deeply appreciate your continued patience, cooperation, and understanding as we work together during this unprecedented time. USF Dining has developed the following plan to issue partial credits to students who left campus early due to COVID-19. For students who have been approved to stay on campus, meal plans will remain active. For students who did not return to campus on or after Monday, March 23, a partial meal plan credit will be issued. The credit will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from March 23 through May 8, 2020, plus the total amount of unused dining dollars. For students who returned to campus on or after Monday, March 23, but subsequently left campus early due to COVID-19, a partial meal plan credit will be issued. The credit will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from the last date of use through May 8, 2020, plus the total amount of unused dining dollars. The credit will appear on the student’s Oasis account by Friday, April 10. It is important to note that the amount of any credit will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s Oasis account, with any remaining credit refunded to the student. USF will make every effort to issue the available refund within a two-week processing period, following the posting of the credit. Specific information regarding refunds can be found on the University Cashier’s website.

1-Apr-20,601,USF,"APRIL 1, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear USF employees, OnMarch 15, President Currall directed all USF employees who were able to work remotely to do so. At that time, students had moved to remote instruction through at least April 6, and the directive to employees similarly expressed a potential to return to work by that time. However, since the release of that letter, USF has extended remote instruction for students for the duration of the spring semester. Additionally, local""Safer at Home""orders have limited the movement of all but essential employees for the foreseeable future. While USF does qualify as an ""essential business"", as a public university, President Currall continues to urge any USF employees who can work from home to do so until further notice. Only employees who have been designated as critical staff by Emergency Management for the purpose of the COVID-19 response should come to campus for any reason. These employees have official documentation from Emergency Management that they must keep with them at all times while on campus. Employees whose job duties do not allow for remote work should work with their supervisors to design work arrangements that fulfill their obligations while complying with CDC social distancing guidance and protecting their health, as well as the health of others. If you have questions or concerns about your specific work assignment, contact your supervisor or Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. We would also like to share some important guidance about enhanced services from our State of Florida carriers and Benefits Providers.

2-Apr-20,320,USF,"APRIL 2, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS FOR RESIDENTS OFF CAMPUS: THOSE WHO HAVE A MOVE-OUT DATE AND THOSE WHO DID NOT YET SIGN-UP Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order number 20-91 regarding essential services and activities during the COVID-19 emergency effective 12:01 a.m. April 3, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This order requires all persons in Florida to limit movements and personal interactions outside of one’s home to only those necessary to obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities. In accordance with this order, USF has suspended the scheduled move-out period of April 8 – May 10 for students away from campus who had planned to return to campus to retrieve their personal belongings. Students and families should NOT return to campus until notified otherwise. Housing offices and 24-hour desks will not be open on-campus while the Executive Order is in place. Given the ever-changing dynamic of the COVID-19 crisis, we are not able to predict when we will issue a new move-out schedule. We do not anticipate move-outs will begin before mid-May. USF will announce a new move-out plan after the Executive Order is lifted. Until then, personal items will remain secured in students’ rooms. Students currently on campus, besides those approved to remain on campus, have been sent individualized instructions for move-out. We appreciate your flexibility as we update our plan of action in this developing situation. We understand that this is a stressful situation and we are deeply sorry for any hardship this crisis may cause you and your loved ones. Our number one priority is to keep you and our community safe. We will do everything we can to support you while adhering to the guidelines set in place to keep us safe and healthy. USF Tampa campus students, please e-mail our office at housing@usf.edu with any questions. USF St. Petersburg campus students, please e-mail housing@usfsp.edu  with any questions. Sincerely, USF Housing & Residential Education"
9-Apr-20,716,USF,"APRIL 9, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear employees, In accordance with Gov. DeSantis’ “safer at home” order, the university has restricted all on-campus operations to Critical Function Personnel only effective April 3, 2020, until at least April 30, 2020. All faculty and staff are encouraged to continue to work remotely until further notice with the following exceptions: On-Campus Critical Function Personnel At this time, Critical Function Personnel are defined as employees designated to report to campus while on-campus operations are restricted, with appropriate documentation issued by Emergency Management. In accordance with the Critical Function Personnel communication sent on March 25 and April 2, authorization is given for the express purpose of enabling those persons who have to get to campus to perform critical functions that cannot be performed remotely to do so. On-campus Critical Function Personnel must be approved by a Dean or VP and include, but are not limited to: Those ensuring the safety and security of campus facilities and community (e.g. health care services, police); Those maintaining research labs that cannot suspend operations; Those providing limited services to students who remain on campus (e.g. housing staff, designated food services); Those required for continuity of services in maintenance/grounds/custodial/transportation; Those who are essential for business continuity (e.g. financial transactions and services staff); Those providing information technology support; Those facilitating distance learning. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that the fewest individuals possible are on campus at any time, in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. For those who must come to campus, departments should continue alternative schedules to promote social distancing, and people should spend the minimum time necessary on campus to perform the authorized critical functions. Temporary Reassignment Program The USF Temporary Reassignment Program has been created to assist employees whose work is not considered essential or critical and who are unable to work remotely with opportunities that could keep them in a paid status by performing alternate, needed work for another university area. Alternate assignments may range from work that can be performed remotely, or in limited cases, critical work that must be performed on a USF campus or at another USF site. Reassignments under this program are optional and are initiated by an employee’s supervisor, working directly with HR. This change in assignment does not alter an employee’s current, established rate of pay and benefits, but may involve change in hours, duties and supervision. The program is temporary and subject to change and may be discontinued with or without notice. Leave options Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), certain employees are eligible for up to 80 hours of emergency sick leave for certain conditions (hours are pro-rated for part-time employees). Those conditions are explained in detail at the Department of Labor (DOL) website. The DOL also provides for expanded Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave up to an additional 10 weeks under specific circumstances. Additionally, a set of frequently asked questions and answers can be found here. For employees performing critical functions on campus, supervisors are encouraged to implement staggered shifts where operations permit in addition to observing published CDC guidance, such as social distancing and good hygiene.  An unintended consequence of staggered shifts is some employees could be unable to work regular full-time hours in a regular work week. Therefore, on a temporary basis, the university will provide up to 80 hours of administrative leave for mission critical employees who are directed to physically report for work on a USF campus through April 30. This program is available to OPS and regular hourly employees only (e.g. salaried employees are excluded). The purpose of this program is to permit hourly employees to complete their essential, on campus duties without worrying about whether they will lose pay on a weekly basis by working on staggered shifts and following additional CDC guidelines. Employees other than those qualifying for the leave above are subject to regular work rules. If the university restricts on-campus operations beyond April 30, leave statuses will be reevaluated at that time. If you have questions or concerns about your specific work assignment, contact your supervisor or the Division of Human Resources Employee Relations team at employee-relations@usf.edu or your Regional HR Office or USF Health HR Office. Thank you for your continued patience and adaptability during these uncertain times."
10-Apr-20,285,USF,"APRIL 10, 2020FACULTY, STAFF Dear faculty and staff, Thank you to all who participated in yesterday’s virtual town hall.  Although we are physically apart, it is inspiring to continue connecting as one USF community. In our first such town hall of its kind, we were joined by roughly 3,500 participants from all across the Tampa Bay region. For those who were not able to join, please find a recording of our session here. I also wish to reiterate my enthusiasm for the newly adopted USF Principles of Community, which will help reinforce a campus climate of mutual support among faculty, staff and students. These Principles will serve as the bedrock for our strategic renewal process, which we began last autumn and will continue this coming summer and autumn.  The Principles will further facilitate our shared strategy, mission, vision and goals for ONE USF, Geographically Distributed. I want to sincerely thank the Task Force for its work, with special recognition to Charles Adams, dean of the Judy Genshaft Honors College and chair of this task force, and Steve Prevaux, university ombuds, who served as its facilitator. Click here to learn more about the Principles and the important process that brought them to fruition. Finally, I want to again offer my sincere appreciation for the incredible adaptability and compassion you have shown during this unprecedented challenge. This crisis has changed the way we live and work, and it will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on our institution. But together, we get to decide what that impact will be.  It’s clear that we will emerge from this crisis stronger, more united and more resilient than ever before. We will prevail! Best wishes, Steven C. Currall President and Professor"
27-Apr-20,476,USF,"APRIL 27, 2020PARENTS AND FAMILY, STUDENTS Dear USF students, USF’s leaders have been working hard with our local, state and federal partners to support you during the COVID-19 crisis. Over the weekend, USF received its $17.4 million portion of a $2.2 trillion economic relief package from the U.S. Department of Education, provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which will be used for emergency student aid. USF will distribute the funds to assist as many of our eligible students as possible to alleviate financial hardships that may impede your academic plans. Please note that funding from the CARES Act comes with eligibility requirements as determined and enforced by the federal government. Current degree-seeking students enrolled at least half time in spring 2020 who are eligible to apply for federal Title IV financial aid are eligible to apply for CARES Act funds. Students enrolled in fully online graduate programs, international, and undocumented students are not eligible per U.S. Department of Education Guidelines. Students with demonstrated needs who did not receive the full $1,000 maximum from the USF United Support Fund are eligible to apply for an additional CARES Act grant. Students who applied for an award from the USF United Support Fund and did not receive an award before those funds were depleted should also apply for a CARES Act grant. Eligible students are invited to complete the Federal CARES Act Emergency Financial Aid Application for consideration for a grant, starting April 27 through Aug. 7, 2020, or until the funds are depleted. Priority will be given to FAFSA filers who have exhausted all financial aid options and who have been impacted by COVID-19 in the following ways: Student and/or spouse loss or reduction of employment (i.e., layoff/furlough or job loss); parental loss or reduction of employment (i.e., layoff/furlough or job loss); or other unexpected circumstances. Examples of expenses eligible to be covered by CARES Act grants include, but are not necessarily limited to, medical bills, food, housing, utilities, technology, course materials, and other unexpected expenses that contribute to the student’s total cost of USF attendance. For more information about the federal CARES Act grant and USF’s distribution of the grant, an FAQ has been created to address your questions. We are already hearing from students whose financial situation is stable now but are concerned about their circumstances in the summer and fall. Given the unknown continued impact of the coronavirus throughout the next several months, a small portion of the federal funding for USF students will be held back for distribution to students during the summer and/or fall. USF is grateful to our federal leaders for providing this important CARES Act emergency funding and helping us support our students. Please explore the grant information and apply early for consideration. Sincerely, Paul Dosal, Ph.D. Vice President of Student Success University of South Florida"
27-Apr-20,1307,USF,"APRIL 27, 2020FACULTY Dear Colleagues, As we begin the last week of the Spring semester, and the sixth week of remote instruction, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you once more for your professional dedication, and to extend my thoughts and best wishes to you and your loved ones in these most challenging of times. Even as some have settled into the routine of a “new normal,” we continue to witness responses that range from frustration to anxiety, anger, hope, and credulity. I know that many of you are eager to re-enter university life as you remember it. As we look to the future, we will continue to be guided by the scientific evidence, along with the reasoned and trusted advice of our public health professionals, scientists, and epidemiologists as we keep our focus, first and foremost, on assuring the safety and wellbeing of the university community across all campuses. Many of you are wondering when USF will return to full campus-based operations, including classroom instruction? As you know, we earlier committed to delivering a broad suite of quality online courses for students throughout Summer sessions A, C, and B. As we contemplate USF’s future state, we will follow a set of guidelines thoughtfully developed by USF’s COVID-19 Task Force, most likely a phased approach with each step being safely implemented as conditions permit. We are also considering multiple scenarios to minimize potential exposure to the virus, including “low residency,” online, and blended or hybrid classes, as well as physical spacing in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, residence halls, and other high traffic areas. In the near term, we will likely continue online student support services for academic advising, tutoring, telehealth, tele-counseling, career services, and faculty mentoring of student research. For now, though, I ask that you remain focused on bringing this semester to a successful close for you and your students. If you haven’t heard about the nature and utility of Student Assessment of Instruction in Spring 2020, you should soon be hearing from your college dean. Finals are to be conducted in accordance with published exam schedules and final grades submitted no later than Tuesday, May 12. Virtual graduation ceremonies are scheduled for all USF campuses, on Saturday, May 9, 2020. If you are planning to conduct final exams utilizing Proctorio, I strongly encourage you and your students to practice ahead of time to mitigate any potential issues. Faculty utilizing Proctorio for their online assessments should provide students with additional time on their test to ensure proper setup, and include the Proctorio Getting Started Checklist and Practice Test available upon request by emailing facultysupport@usf.edu. You can find additional resources and training by visiting USF’s fully online workshop, Online Proctoring with Proctorio. Meantime, some of you are already working with colleagues from USF Innovative Education to prepare for the delivery of quality online student learning this Summer. These experiences are expected to be quite different than the remote instruction so many transitioned to over Spring Break and, accordingly, “instructors of record” engaged in converting their class to a quality online platform for Summer will be compensated for the additional effort. Recognizing that faculty members are the subject experts, each one is assigned a ""learning designer"" who supports the instructor in both design and delivery of the course. For others, the Summer months will provide a welcome respite to re-engage more fully with your research, scholarly and creative agendas and, perhaps, to bring greater balance to your professional and personal lives. However, as we look ahead to Fall 2020, I strongly encourage you to find some time in the coming months to advance your state of readiness for future disruptions to customary on-campus instruction and learning support, including having your courses ready in Canvas. Some have been asking what the future holds for USF? While members of our community should be rightly interested in the future fiscal health of the higher education sector in these unprecedented times, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that different universities, in different states (and nations), will respond to their unique circumstances in different ways. President Currall has affirmed his commitment to maintaining our institutional vision for the future: rising to become a Top 25 public research university and positioning USF for membership eligibility in the Association of American Universities (AAU). The Board of Trustees recently approved the USF 2020 Accountability Plan (to be submitted to the Board of Governors) that maintains our strategic roadmap. With that said, I can assure you that USF’s leadership is actively and regularly engaged in assessing the university’s fiscal health, continuing and future operations, along with our strategic path forward. As you might imagine, given the continuing uncertainties, it would be premature, and arguably ill-advised, to make decisions affecting the university’s strategic future without being more fully informed. Important data continue to be collected, evaluated, discussed, and USF’s future modeled, in regularly scheduled meetings led by President Currall. Critical stakeholder groups, including USF’s faculty, will be consulted as future plans are developed. For now, I urge you to focus on what you do best: delivering a world-class learning experience for our students and seeking novel answers to complex questions and problems through high impact research and scholarly and creative activity. Most importantly, we should fully anticipate that continuing our record of robust student enrollment, progress, and graduation will influence future decision-making. To that end, we have been working diligently for many weeks to ensure high levels of retention for continuing students and high yield rates for new students in both Summer and Fall semesters. Colleges, departments, professors, and advisors have an important and active role to play in this campaign. Moreover, recognizing that so many of our current and future students and families are facing financial hardship, we have extended the FTIC application and deposit deadlines, waived deposits for students facing financial difficulties due to COVID-19, moved student orientation online, and proposed “rebalancing” student fees for Summer to ensure that students pay no more this year than they did in 2019. In fact, we expect many students will pay less this Summer as we have “paused” collection of course-related fees. As you know, in recent weeks, more than $300,000 has been awarded to students with demonstrated financial need through the USF United Support Fund, and thanks to the generous contributions of so many. You may also have read that USF received an allocation of $17.4 M through the federal CARES Act for emergency financial aid. The first automatic disbursements were made to nearly 6,000 USF students over the past weekend. Applications for additional awards opened today. Meanwhile, university planning and operations continue. Consolidation is on track with the expectation that USF will begin operations as one university, across three campuses, on July 1, 2020. To this end, I have been working closely with multi-campus deans and regional chancellors to ensure equity of assignment, equity of support, and equity in performance expectations beginning this Fall, regardless of a faculty member’s “home campus.” Also, searches for the next dean in the College of the Arts, the College of Marine Science, the College of Nursing, and Undergraduate Studies continue. In closing, it is my wish that in the coming weeks, you are able to restore some balance in your lives. Above all, please get plenty of rest, eat well, exercise, and stay healthy. To prevail in these uncommon times will be akin to running a marathon. We will all need to pace ourselves. Again, please don’t hesitate to reach out to your chairs, deans, or myself should you have questions. Stay close to USF and check the FAQs for regular updates. Rest assured that, as public health conditions, related considerations and, thus, USF’s future becomes clearer, I will do my utmost to provide clear and confident guidance to our highly valued faculty members. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox Provost and Professor"

1-May-20,507,USF,"MAY 1, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, I hope that you and your families are safe and well. Over the past few months, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted society and altered our normal university life. We are all eager to know what the future holds and when our lives will regain some normalcy. I share your concerns, and I want to take this opportunity to provide some insights into our decision-making process moving forward. As our state and national leaders introduce plans to re-open our economy in phases over the next weeks and months, my leadership team and I are developing similar plans to resume face-to-face instruction and other activities as soon as deemed appropriate. As the USF leadership team has done at every stage of this crisis, we will prioritize the health and safety of our campus community. Normal resumption of operations will only be carried out when community transmission of COVID-19 has diminished and the threat to the university can be safely mitigated. For now, our previous guidance about remote instruction over the summer and employees working remotely until further notice remains in effect. On-campus events, including athletics events and summer camps, will remain suspended through at least July unless you are notified otherwise. We have every intention of resuming face-to-face instruction and some activities during the fall, with modifications and precautions designed to support high-quality academic instruction and student success while maintaining health and safety. These precautions will include but may not be limited to: requiring face coverings, limiting the number of individuals gathered in any one area, enhanced cleaning, and leveraging available testing and contact-tracing resources. We will also likely continue to provide some instruction or operations remotely. Our residential students will receive further guidance regarding fall housing plans from USF’s Housing and Residential Education leaders, once we have more clarity. Our international students should also expect to hear from USF World about how our decisions may impact them. The University of South Florida is and will always be a beacon for optimism and hope. Solving problems and shaping the future is central to our mission. This current challenge has illuminated our mission more clearly than ever. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and innovative thinking of so many of our experts, physicians, nurses, scientists, researchers, and staff members who are on the front lines of understanding and fighting this virus. We should not take for granted how fortunate we are to be part of such a strong ecosystem that thrives on collaboration and creativity. Moreover, we should take comfort knowing that we will not simply endure this crisis, but that USF is playing an integral role in its solutions. There is one thing that we know with absolute certainty: the University of South Florida community will emerge from the current circumstances stronger than ever! We will provide more updates as soon as we have them. Please continue to reach out to COVIDquestions@usf.edu with any additional questions. Steven C. Currall President and Professor"
4-May-20,124,USF,"MAY 4, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Student, employee and patient confidentiality laws prevent USF from disclosing the names of individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. Per state and federal guidelines, any individual who has tested positive will be isolated. Any individuals who have concerns about their health are encouraged to work with the appropriate medical professionals and follow guidance from the Florida Department of Health and U.S. Centers for Disease Control. USF will provide updates to the community when the university is informed of a positive case. However, please be aware that if a student, employee or the health department fails to disclose a positive test to the university, USF may have no way of knowing and communicating that information."
6-May-20,319,USF,"May 6, 2020 Dear Resident, Housing & Residential Education has been working hard to plan a safe and successful move-out for our residents currently away from campus. Please take the time to review each section. On Wednesday, April 29, Governor Ron DeSantis announced the “Safe. Smart. Step-by-Step."" Plan for Florida’s Recovery (Executive Order Number 20-112). This order lifts the “Stay at Home” Order (Executive Order number 20-91) in Florida on Monday, May 4, in all counties except Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Therefore, USFSP Housing & Residential Education will begin to re-open the move-out sign up form to allow residents to begin returning to campus, in staggered phases, to move out their belongings. Our philosophy surrounding our move-out plan is focused on an expedient move-out for our residents in the safest way possible. Our plan is based on guidelines from state and local leadership and the CDC, as well as campus layout and resident distribution. In order to accomplish a safe and balanced move-out schedule, we have established move-out timeslots based on building population and resident’s home address on file. As noted above, Florida residents from Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties remain restricted from return to the residence halls, per guidance from the Governor’s Office. Residents from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Louisiana are also restricted (Executive Order Number 20-82 and Executive Order Number 20-86). We will add appropriate dates and times for these residents to return to campus as additional information becomes available. MOVE-OUT DATES/TIMES Please see the table below to identify your move-out window based on your home address in OASIS and your assigned building on campus. Residents who are physically off campus must sign-up via the Housing Portal for a move-out time slot within your assigned dates before returning to campus. To maintain social distancing practices on campus, residents will be permitted in their building only during their selected date and time."
13-May-20,724,USF,"MAY 13, 2020STUDENTS Dear USF students: As we put the Spring 2020 semester in our rearview mirror, I wanted to thank you for your patience and perseverance. The “grit” and determination that you demonstrated in the face of adversity during the past seven weeks has been truly inspiring. It is this attitude that has many of you looking forward and wondering, “What comes next?”, so I thought I would share what I know at this time. Financial Concerns First, I understand that many in our USF community have been impacted by financial hardship, as an untold number of students and family members have lost their jobs. To offer some relief, USF has identified funds that we can award to our students both through our own United Support fundraising efforts and from the federal government. Currently, funds are still available from the CARES Act to students meeting federally mandated requirements. If you have not investigated this funding source, please visit www.usf.edu/financial-aid/cares-act to review the eligibility requirements and apply. [Note: If you have not completed a FAFSA previously, please do so before applying.] Most importantly, USF will soon roll out an unprecedented financial aid stimulus package for students wanting to study full-time this fall, including students who were not eligible for CARES Act funding. The USF Board of Trustees recently took unprecedented action by approving a summer fee package to ensure that student tuition and fees will not increase. As a result, many of you will see a decrease in the cost of your education over last year. We are one of just two Florida universities that have taken such action to date. Academic Continuity Of course, most of you will be continuing your academic journey at USF this summer and in the fall semester. More students have already signed-up for classes than this time last year, so if you haven’t registered for summer and fall yet, now is a good time!  I encourage you to make an appointment with your academic adviser as soon as possible and work with them to stay on track toward timely graduation. Summer sessions A and C begin online on May 18, and session B begins online on June 29. Like you, I am eager to return to campus this Fall whether it be in Tampa, St. Petersburg, or Sarasota-Manatee and, as President Currall made clear in his May 1 letter to our university community “We have every intention of resuming face-to-face instruction and some activities during the fall, with modifications and precautions designed to support high-quality academic instruction and student success while maintaining health and safety.” Our dedicated professors and professional staff are striving to ensure that we continue to deliver a world-class education and university experience, whether online or in-person. Additionally, our undergraduate and graduate students will continue to work alongside our professors in discovering novel solutions to complex problems through research, scholarly, and creative activity. It’s a part of our commitment at a top tier, preeminent research university. As we prepare to resume activities on our campuses this fall, the health and safety of our academic communities remain our highest priority. Of course, campus operations can only return once community transmission of COVID-19 has diminished, and the threat to our communities can be safely mitigated. Life on campus will be different with the introduction of practices that will most likely include enhanced cleaning protocols, physical distancing, required face coverings, testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, or self-isolation when necessary. Throughout our planning, USF is incredibly fortunate to be guided by a world-class team of health professionals and scientists who were studying infectious diseases of this kind long before COVID-19 became part of our daily lives. Wherever you find yourselves this summer and fall, whether in Tampa Bay, somewhere else in Florida, across the nation, or around the world, we are committed to effectively and compassionately ensuring that you can confidently continue your USF journey both inside and outside the classroom. Remember, we’re on this path together, and I hope to see you back on campus and actively engaged in the life of USF very soon. In the meantime, please take care of yourselves, let me know how we can help, and I encourage you to keep a watchful eye on the USF website for regular COVID-19 updates. Best regards, Ralph C. Wilcox, PhD Provost & Executive Vice President"
19-May-20,609,USF,"MAY 19, 2020COMMUNITY, FACULTY, PARENTS AND FAMILY, STAFF, STUDENTS Dear USF community, On Monday, the Florida Board of Governors announced that all 12 state universities are preparing to reopen in the fall using a set of guidelines that will be established over the next couple of weeks. The announcement reaffirms what I shared with you earlier this month regarding our intention to resume some face-to-face courses, services and activities in the fall. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff will remain our top priority as we make decisions about how and when to gradually proceed. When we begin to phase in more on-campus operations, you can expect there will be modifications and precautions in place to support a healthy environment. For now, we ask everyone who can to continue working remotely. I understand that many of you are eager to hear more details about what will occur in the fall.  We know you have many questions. I can assure you that my leadership team and I, along with our partners across the State University System and the Board of Governors, are working diligently to fully develop our plans. I want to use this opportunity to outline the deliberative process we’re using to make these important decisions and a timeline. The USF COVID-19 Task Force formed in early March and led by USF College of Public Health Dean Donna Petersen, is providing my leadership team with valuable analysis and options regarding a phased-in approach for returning to our campuses. USF is fortunate to have world-class public health and medical experts among our faculty to help guide us through this process. The task force includes broad membership from across the university, including Academic Affairs, Student Success, Research and Innovation, USF Health, Student Health Services, representatives from each of our campuses and others. Working closely with the task force, the USF Emergency Management team, under the capable leadership of Jennifer Fleischman, has adapted our existing University Recovery Plan to include nine workgroups charged with developing a set of considerations and proposals for my leadership team to evaluate. These groups are assessing the key aspects of increasing on-campus operations, including community wellness, academic continuity and support services, financial resources, facilities, student housing and more. In early June, we expect to present our plan for the fall to the USF Board of Trustees, and on June 23 we’ll do the same with the Florida Board of Governors. As we take these steps and advance our plans over the summer, we pledge to keep you informed and communicate updates when we have more information. We value your input as part of this process. Faculty and staff will soon receive surveys to gauge your opinions about returning to campus. We’ve taken similar measures with students and we hope to gather more feedback to understand your experiences and the factors important to you. As we move forward, we know that COVID-19 will continue to present unique challenges and all of us must be prepared to show the same adaptability and flexibility that we’ve demonstrated over the past several months. Our framework for returning to campus will include following the guidelines set by local, state and federal governments while also constantly monitoring COVID-19 data for our campuses and surrounding communities to address any issues proactively. I wish to express my gratitude to all of you for your patience and resiliency as we navigate this global crisis together. While life on campus will look different in the fall, our creativity and innovative way of thinking will allow us to maintain a sense of community and emerge stronger than ever. Sincerely, Steven C. Currall President and Professor"

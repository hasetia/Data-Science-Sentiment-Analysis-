28-Feb-20,564,T_A&M_U,"February 28, 2020, 5:45 p.m. CST Dear Texas A&M community, Out of an abundance of caution, the University is canceling Spring Break trips to Italy for Texas A&M Education Abroad programs after authorities recommended travelers self-quarantine for two weeks. University leaders are following developments regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19, and will keep our campus community informed. Any students, faculty and staff traveling to Italy or any other country considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be a level 3 risk for coronavirus are required to follow the guidelines to self-quarantine for two weeks, and not return to campus unless they are asymptomatic for that period. The level 3 warning urges people to avoid nonessential travel if the destination is an affected area. China and South Korea already were categorized as being at level 3, which put them on Texas A&M’s suspend-all-travel list. Aggieland low risk Please keep in mind that while COVID-19 is an epidemic in some parts of the world, the Department of State Health Services says that Texas is considered to be at low risk. Closer to home, the Brazos County Health Department considers Aggieland to be at low risk as well. At this time, the CDC and World Health Organization are not recommending canceling or postponing other worldwide travel. Therefore, the university is not canceling any other Education Abroad programs already underway or for those planning other trips over Spring Break. In the coming weeks, Texas A&M will arrange to refund trip costs for the approximately 30 students and faculty who planned to study abroad in Italy over Spring Break. Those impacted by this decision who need to make alternate housing arrangements over Spring Break, along with students who have questions related to the Education Abroad program, can email ea-covid19@tamu.edu. A&M planning well underway Texas A&M University is more than a month into planning for responding to whatever might come our way. A team of university officials continues to constantly monitor the outbreak of the fast-spreading respiratory illness worldwide. To assess potential risks related to the illness, the university is working with governmental agencies, professional health and security organizations, our academic partners and others. Texas A&M strongly recommends that everyone reconsider even personal travel to any country with a level 3 advisory based on the novel coronavirus. For countries at level 2 and 3, travelers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to campus. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites. Students who are traveling should, in addition to taking recommended measures to prevent getting sick, take basic precautions to prepare for potential travel disruptions. We will need your help. A few easy things we can all do include: Wash your hands for 20 seconds Use hand sanitizer Avoid shaking hands  Disinfect frequently touched objects using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe stay home when you are sick and avoid close contact with those who are sick Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Texas A&M will continue to work with federal, state and local officials to monitor potential risks. If conditions change, we will update our campus community. Please check A&M Student Health Services website for updated information.

To that end, today’s update relates to our students, faculty, staff and visitors who have visited areas affected by COVID-19, or the coronavirus. To date, no such cases have been reported in Brazos County, which is home to Aggieland. As we carefully track the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Levels 1, 2 and 3 risk assessment for COVID-19, we are now implementing guidelines consistent with direction from The Texas A&M University System. Our regular updates can be found on the Texas A&M coronavirus page, also found on a button on the tamu.edu home page. As of March 2, 2020, the following countries are categorized as Level 1, 2 and 3 countries: Level 3: China, Iran, Italy and South Korea Level 2: Japan Level 1: Hong Kong Guidance on Returning to the United States Texas A&M-sponsored student groups currently returning from Level 2 or 3 countries should follow CDC guidelines by self-isolating at their family home or off-campus residence for 14 days.

Ongoing Actions To ensure the safety and security of Texas A&M students, faculty and staff, we are doing the following: We are sharing information with local, regional and state public health authorities and the Texas A&M University System administration to ensure the appropriate exchange and notification of timely information. Spring Break and personal travel: Texas A&M does not set requirements for personal travel, but we are strongly urging people to not travel to areas with active community transmission and/or Level 1, 2 or 3 countries. All travelers are encouraged to check the CDC’s COVID-19 travel page, State Department travel advisories, and the International Air Transport Association’s list of travel and entry restrictions for the latest information before departing. Regardless of personal or professional travel, all individuals visiting Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to undergo the 14-day self-isolation period before returning to campus. Note that if you leave the country, your trip may affect your ability to return to the United States and campus. During the 14 days of self-isolation, students should contact Student Health Services for updated guidance and requirements prior to returning to school or work. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation and it is difficult to anticipate what the future may hold. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites. Students who are traveling should, in addition to taking recommended measures to prevent getting sick, take basic precautions to prepare for potential travel disruptions.

3-Mar-20,1099,T_A&M_U,"March 3, 2020, 5:45 p.m. CST Texas A&M continues to monitor the spread of the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, as more cases are confirmed in the United States and other countries. We continue to use the best advice and guidance available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and the Texas Department of State Health Services. Texas A&M leadership from across the university is meeting regularly to discuss and review the rapidly evolving situation regarding the spread of COVID-19. We have activated the emergency operations plan and convened our response team to coordinate preparedness and response activities. At this time, no one within our campus community has tested positive for COVID-19. Nevertheless, we want to make sure our community is informed and follows preventative measures. Emergency Management on Campus The university is relying on local and state health officials, as well as members of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, Centers for Disease and Preparedness and the World Health Organization, to ensure a consistent and coordinated response. The university also is working with The Texas A&M University System and other institutions of higher education to ensure that issues related to campus communities are appropriately addressed. Administration leaders are actively planning for a range of scenarios and potential short- and longer-term impacts, with particular focus on the health and well-being of the university community, as well as on the continuity of university operations. Despite the rapidly changing nature of this situation, we are prepared to respond as necessary, including the activation of the university’s business continuity plan, which accounts for issues involving employment and instruction of our students. Student Health Services and the Departments of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs, along with many campus partners, all are paying close attention to this situation. Travel Advisory Update As we carefully track the CDC’s risk assessment for COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines consistent with direction from The Texas A&M University System. Our regular updates can be found on the Texas A&M coronavirus page, also found on a button on the tamu.edu home page. As of March 3, 2020, the following are categorized by the CDC as Level 1, 2 and 3 countries: Level 3 COVID-19: China, Iran, Italy and South Korea Level 2 COVID-19: Japan Level 1 COVID-19: Hong Kong Guidance on Leaving & Returning to the United States All Texas A&M students, faculty, staff or visitors traveling to, from or through Level 2 or 3 COVID-19 risk countries must remain at their family home or off-campus residence for a minimum of 14 days before returning to the A&M campus. We highly recommend following CDC guidelines to self-isolate during this period. Should symptoms occur, seek immediate medical attention. Guidance for International Travel Texas A&M University-sponsored student education abroad spring programs for CDC-labeled Level 1, 2 and 3 COVID-19 countries have been cancelled. Other programs are scheduled to continue and will follow the same protocol should those countries move into any of these categories. For other countries, programs will be discontinued if the threat level increases. For faculty and staff, mission-critical travel to countries Level 1 or above will require high-level institutional approval prior to departure. What Does it Mean to Self-Isolate? If you are not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 and are asked to self-isolate after returning from a country listed on the CDC’s COVID-19 travel advisories page as Level 2 or Level 3, you should stay home — in your room, your apartment, or your house. Do not go to campus including work, classes, athletic events or other social gatherings until 14 days after leaving the Level 2 or 3 country in question. Likewise, avoid public places and gatherings in the community. Please follow these guidelines for self-isolation: Report any symptoms of COVID-19 immediately to your medical provider – preferably by calling to get advice and instructions. Texas A&M students and international visiting scholars may call (979) 458-8300. For after-hours contact/inquiries, call the Dial-a-Nurse program at (979) 458-8379. Stay in your room or apartment. Do not go to work, classes, athletic events, or other social or religious gatherings until 14 days after your return to the United States from the country in question. Limit contact as much as possible. This also means limiting close contact with others including persons living in your residence. Wash your hands with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs after coughing or sneezing or throwing a used tissue in the garbage. Avoid sharing household items. Do not share drinking glasses, towels, eating utensils, bedding, or any other items until you are no longer asked to self-isolate. Keep your surroundings clean. While the virus is not spread very well from contact with soiled household surfaces, try to clean surfaces that you share with others, such as door knobs, telephones, and bathroom surfaces (or any other object that you sneeze or cough on), with a standard household disinfectant wipe. Wash your hands after cleaning the area. Monitor yourself for symptoms at least daily including measuring your temperature. Any symptoms of COVID-19 should be reported to your physician. Cover coughs and sneezes with your upper sleeve or a tissue. Never cough in the direction of someone else. How to Protect Myself Stay educated on the disease by reading the CDC website. Most people who become infected experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of yourself by following recommendations from the CDC: Stay home if you don’t feel well. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance before arriving at a medical facility. Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water for 20 seconds. This helps kill viruses that might be on your hand. Stay at least three feet away from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow good respiratory hygiene, which means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the tissue immediately.

Student workers are permitted to work in person on campus provided that the department for which they work implements appropriate social distancing requirements and other safety measures. We recommend that departments be creative in identifying mechanisms to allow student workers to work remotely with the provision that appropriate duties can be assigned and that the department has mechanisms in place to monitor that work. Student workers should contact their supervisor regarding their ability to work. Students feeling ill should not come to work and should self-monitor and seek medical care if needed. Students not ill and not wishing to work in person will not be required to do so and will continue to be paid only if remote work is a possibility per above and approved by their supervisor. If students are unable to work in person or remotely, the student will not be paid. Departments are encouraged to provide as much flexibility regarding duties as feasible. Sincerely, Carol A.

As a result of the increased health screening upon arrival at these airports, and as these airports are experiencing long delays and large volumes of traffic clearing customs and health screening, any international traveler arriving at these airports (listed below) – be it coming from a Level 3 or other country – from Saturday March 14 onward will have an increased chance of exposure than other travelers. Therefore, any faculty, staff and students returning from international travel on or after March 14 and arriving in-country to clear customs at the Boston (BOS), Miami (MIA), New York City (JFK), Chicago (ORD), San Francisco (SFO), Seattle (SEA), Los Angeles (LAX), Atlanta (ATL), Honolulu (HNL), Newark (EWR), Dallas (DFW), Detroit (DTW) or Washington, D.C. (IAD) international airports should consider themselves as having returned from a Level 3 COVID-19 location and self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival before returning to campus. Self-isolation guidance is listed in Frequently Asked Questions section of this web page and on the CDC Care Guide. Domestic travelers through all airports and international travelers from non-level 3 countries arriving at airports other than those listed are required only to self-monitor at this time. Self-monitoring guidance is listed in Frequently Asked Questions section of this web page and on the CDC Care Guide. Only international travel should be recorded on the travel reporting portal.

17-Mar-20,430,T_A&M_U,"March 17, 2020, 4:00 p.m. CDT Due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on event sizes announced by the White House, Spring graduation ceremonies will be postponed. The university is planning mail delivery of diplomas to graduates (with normal shipping costs waived) and is also considering opportunities for in-person ceremony options later this summer for those May graduates wishing to do so. There is no impact at this time to August in-person graduation ceremonies. Three other major decisions made today include the following: Final exams will not be taken in person. Online testing and other mechanisms for the assessment of student learning are under consideration in collaboration with college deans and faculty and will be announced in the near future. Family Weekend, a 101-year-old tradition filled with dozens of events scheduled for April has also been canceled. The Campus Muster Committee announced that the campus Muster Ceremony would not be held in its traditional in-person format in Reed Arena. The Muster Committee is working closely with The Association of Former Students to provide guidance to the campus and the entire Aggie Network. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic last week, prompting Brazos County, the State of Texas and the federal government to declare a public health emergency. Meanwhile, the White House advised Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The Association of Former Students announced earlier today that Aggie Ring Day scheduled for April has been canceled. Alternate plans were sent to recipients through an email notification. Students will be able to have their ring mailed to them or they can pick it up at the Williams Alumni Center after Texas A&M resumes normal operations. President Michael K. Young said that leaders at the university recognize how the cancellations and changes associated with the virus have created uncertainty and disappointment. ""These are very difficult decisions made with careful thought and input from faculty, staff and students,"" Young said. ""Around the world and here in Aggieland, the unprecedented disruption and sprawling impact of the pandemic are unfolding at a precious time for our university — graduation, finals, major events. And at the same time, we know that most essential is preserving health and safety and continuing to support ongoing education online."" ""Aggies always rise to the occasion and I’m confident we will do so in this situation,"" he said. ""We need to take care of each other, support one another and together we will find our way through."" Frequently Asked Questions and other updated information can be viewed on the TAMU COVID-19 Guidance site."
19-Mar-20,833,T_A&M_U,"March 19, 2020, 4:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and Aggie Network, Our nation, state and we here at Texas A&M University face serious challenges from this global pandemic. This extraordinary situation with COVID-19 coronavirus requires applying everything we are as Aggies – leadership, loyalty, integrity, excellence, respect for each other, and, of course, selfless service – to navigate daily challenges. During this moment of uncertainty, I understand the stress and anxiety many may feel. And yet, I have great faith in our Aggie community. We will get through this together and demonstrate again Aggies’ capacity to surmount every challenge. Just today, Brazos County Health District reported that one of our students in Brazos County tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling to New York. We have confirmed that the student was not on campus after travelling to New York. We send our best wishes for recovery and are supporting our student and the health authorities. There are no other known cases among Texas A&M students, faculty and staff at this time. We continue to monitor developments and will keep you apprised. Like many of you, in addition to concern for all who may face such a diagnosis, I am deeply disappointed that circumstances have forced us to postpone or adjust so many of our timeless traditions. I think of the thousands of students whose hearts were set on walking across the stage to receive their diplomas in May. I think of those who were looking forward to honoring a loved one in person here at Muster. Of dozens of events related to the 101-year-old Family Weekend tradition. And I think of those who dreamed of proudly receiving their Aggie ring, surrounded by family and friends at the Haynes Ring Plaza. In recent days, I am reminded that these are not the only traditions that define us. So too does the character that the absence of these beloved events reveals inside us. As we continue to monitor the best ways to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic pandemic, I am sincerely grateful for everyone helping us address our two highest priorities. First of all, I would like to thank all of those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff at our campuses in Texas, at our Qatar campus, and in support of our education abroad programs around the world. Our spirit of collaboration and compassion has been on full display as we continue to work diligently to assist students who have been impacted by our current state of affairs. Secondly, I want to recognize the large contingent of faculty and staff who are helping us keep our core educational mission intact as much as possible by making the transition to online classes, further protecting the wellbeing of our campuses and local communities. I would like to offer a few words about our operations as we are set to resume all classes next week online. We’ve seen a lot of campus closures across the nation. We remain open as circumstances allow with a full commitment to protecting the safety and educational environment for students who choose to come back to our campuses, as well as faculty and staff. On our campuses, this translates to remote work where possible for faculty and staff while core on-campus services continue. The “new normal” for the time being includes a number of adjustments: online instruction, as well as online support, including counseling and advising, take-away-only dining and limited transportation with social distancing throughout all campus facilities. While many of our students have returned or have chosen to stay at their homes elsewhere, those on our campuses will experience modified services to ensure safety and a productive learning environment. We encourage students and their families to determine the best choice themselves, be it in their homes or on one of our Texas campuses. Our collective efforts have helped us respond to COVID-19 challenges as they arise, and we are also mindful that new developments and recommendations are constantly emerging, which is why we’ve created a central website for coronavirus updates  across a range of relevant topics. As you all know, circumstances change on a rapid basis. I encourage you to visit the site often for the latest updates. Although what we are undergoing now is certainly not part of the common Texas A&M educational experience, it’s not entirely unprecedented. More than 100 years ago, in response to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, university activities were dramatically modified. Aggies learned then the lessons about dedication, resilience and service. And again today, this situation teaches us lessons of perseverance, innovation, compassion and loyalty to our communities, our state, our nation and our world. With gratitude for all you’re doing and great appreciation for the privilege I have of being part of the Aggie community, I thank you for your patience and understanding as we get through this together.

The Brazos County Health District has tracked contact patterns to be in communication with those with whom these individuals came in close contact. The Brazos County Health District advised today evidence of community spread in Brazos County, as has been the case in other areas of Texas. This community spread case was not one of the aforementioned Texas A&M cases. Since that time, we have learned of two more individuals associated with Texas A&M who have tested positive: one individual who works in a small area of the veterinary school and one individual at the Round Rock campus of the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Health authorities have been notified and contact tracing begun. We take this opportunity to remind our community of important information regarding COVID-19. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, we are requesting your immediate attention to and compliance with the following health-authority-recommended practices – not only to ensure your own well-being, but the well-being of others: Engage in social distancing of six or more feet. Stay home when ill or if other family members are ill. Leverage telework options. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Get a flu vaccine.

21-Mar-20,631,T_A&M_U,"March 21, 2020, 1:20 p.m. CDT Temporary Changes to Grading, Q-Drop and Withdrawal Deadlines Sent on behalf of President Michael K. Young and Provost and Executive Vice President Carol A. Fierke Upon a recommendation from the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and approved by President Young, students will have the opportunity to choose Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for any course in which they are enrolled in the spring semester 2020. Students have until 5pm on Tuesday, April 28th to make changes to their grading options. Details of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee’s proposal are outlined below. Additional guidance to students on how to opt-in to S/U grading will be provided next week. This may not be applicable to students in first professional degree programs who should contact their program for grading information. In addition to the S/U grading, the Q-drop and Withdrawal deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. on Friday, April 24th. Q-drops after Spring Break will not count toward the institutional limit of 4 nor the state limit on drops. Any student considering the change from graded to S/U grading may need to consult with an academic advisor, professional school advisor, athletics advisor, or financial aid advisor to understand the implications of the change on one’s future plans including progress toward a degree or financial aid. Finally, the Faculty Senate Executive Committee is asking faculty to ensure that students have ample opportunity to engage with them during this shift to online instruction. We would like to thank the Faculty Senate Executive Committee for their work and deliberation on these important matters. FULL TEXT OF FACULTY SENATE RECOMMENDATIONS The Faculty Senate Executive Committee met on March 18, 2020 to discuss options surrounding issues of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading this semester. The recommendations of the Faculty Senate on this issue are: Retain the course’s current grading scheme as the default (e.g., Letter grade: A, B, C, D, or F). Students may choose an S/U grading scheme on a course-by-course basis for the spring 2020 semester. All programs that normally require a course for a letter grade must accept S/U grades for all courses this semester. Students will be allowed to switch to S/U Grading until the last day of classes by 5 p.m. on April 28th. Students are strongly advised to talk with their academic advisor before switching any course to S/U grading. If a student is currently not making satisfactory academic progress for financial aid and is on an academic plan, those students should consult with a financial aid advisor prior to switching any course to S/U grading. The S/U grading will adhere to its current Definition in Student Rule 10 (Student Rule 10; “S: Satisfactory (C or above, hours not included in GPA, U: Unsatisfactory (D or F), no grade points, hours included in GPA), except as noted in number 7 below. Any U or F grade received this semester will be removed from GPA computations. S/U grading applies to both Undergraduates and Graduate Students. Similarly, the Executive Committee also recommends the University consider: Extending the Q-drop deadline until April 24th. Q-drops requested after Spring Break will not be added to the student’s cumulative Q-Drop total. Extending the withdrawal deadline to 5 p.m. on April 24th. The Faculty Senate Executive Committee also makes the following recommendation regarding Instructional office hours this semester: The Faculty Senate Executive Committee believes it is the responsibility of all Faculty and Instructors of Record to ensure that all students have adequate access to their instructors during this unique semester. Therefore, we implore every Instructor of Record to ensure that they are holding frequent, potentially extended, and published office hours. This published information, disseminated to their students, should include specific details on the instructor’s preferred method of communication, and how, where, and when that instructor can be contacted."

In a matter of days, your heroic efforts have helped us fundamentally change everything we do – from educating our students, to conducting research, to maintaining essential business operations. During this challenging time, you have shown us the true character of our university community. Aggies never shrink from a challenge, they always rise to the occasion – with decisive action, inspiring innovation and remarkable determination. As faculty members, you have demonstrated your incredible care for and commitment to our students. Although circumstances have dramatically altered your plans for research and teaching, you have stepped up at an important moment. You have shared your collective wisdom and resources with colleagues across the university, working rapidly and tirelessly to rewrite syllabi and take all of our educational efforts online. I know how meaningful your efforts are for our students, and I want you to know how much all of us appreciate your hard work. I also want to thank and recognize the dedication of our exceptional staff across the university. At a time of great need, you have stepped forward with flexibility, resiliency and resolve. In addition to keeping our campus clean and safe, you are providing the entire IT infrastructure that is making all of our endeavors possible – from online classes, to Zoom meetings, to keeping our Learning Management System running smoothly. In only days you have set up both the TAMU Keep Teaching site to help faculty get connected quickly with resources as well as the TAMU Keep Learning site to help students do the same. You have also conducted most of the 1,342 technology trainings centrally, as well as countless sessions in our colleges and departments. The Central TAMU COVID-19 site that provides a centralized hub for updates and resources has been viewed more than 325,000 times. As we move so many services online, we know the process won’t be perfect. There will be challenges that will arise and things that may not work as planned. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we do our best to maintain the very highest quality of education and research, as well as ensure the health and safety of everyone at Texas A&M. For many members of our university community, this has been a demanding time. So many of you have worked round-the-clock, night and day, without rest or relief. You have had to adjust work schedules and find new solutions for childcare. While words may be of little comfort, I want you to know this. We all see your efforts. We appreciate all of your contributions. And we are all truly grateful for your extraordinary service. Thank you for your support and your continued commitment as we work together to keep everyone safe and carry out our educational mission. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"
23-Mar-20,345,T_A&M_U,"Update: March 23, 2020, 6 p.m. CDT At 4:30 p.m. March 23, Brazos County Judge Duane Peters, along with the mayors of Bryan and College Station, ordered individuals to shelter at their place of residence beginning at 9 p.m. Tuesday, March 24 for two weeks. This does not preclude students from leaving campus to travel home or to travel to essential activities (obtaining food, healthcare and medical supplies) or exercising outside with social distancing of six feet or more. For the full order, go here. March 23, 2020, 3:00 p.m. CDT Students, Yesterday, Governor Abbott held a news conference to brief on measures that he and other state leaders are taking to help slow the spread of COVID-19, including not leaving home unless necessary. He did not order a state-wide shelter in place of residence to allow counties the option to do so on a county-by-county basis. Given that Dallas and McLennan Counties have announced their own shelter in place of residence orders, and others may follow suit very soon, all students may want to consider returning to their family home residences. For those in need of housing, you may remain in on-campus housing and should be prepared to shelter in place if the order follows for our College Station and/or Galveston campuses. We will of course continue dining take-out, medical and other essential services, and academic affairs support has already moved online. On-campus students choosing to depart may utilize an “Express Check-Out” option with Residence Life to allow for an orderly move of belongings. Students who have been dwelling in their family homes but retained on-campus housing and wish to check out may also coordinate with Residence Life on arranging to pick up their belongings at some point this semester. The Texas A&M System is reviewing dining and housing credit or refund options and will provide guidance in the very near future. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we do all we can to support Aggies, especially those who may not have other housing and dining options. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"

There will be no penalties for failure to give full notice and early cancellation from March 24 through May 22 (or July 31 if a 12-month contract). Dining: Students who wish to receive a refund (or credit) for dining must apply at https://fda.tamu.edu/diningcredit; the students’ dining privileges will be suspended the business day following their application. This refund (or credit) will be calculated based upon the total amount of unused dining dollars and a prorated amount for meal plans based on the length of time between the business day following their application and May 9, 2020. For either Housing (other than Gardens Apartments) or Dining, students may choose to either apply any prorated amounts as a credit to their Fall 2020 student fees or receive a direct refund. The amount of any refund will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s fee account, with any remainder refunded via direct deposit. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"
24-Mar-20,797,T_A&M_U,"Impact of Shelter in Place of Residence March 24, 2020, 2:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: These rapid succession of updates are necessary today as we respond to the Brazos County deadline shelter in place of residence order and I ask you to review carefully. Any updates will continue to be housed on the COVID-19 TAMU site. Galveston and other campuses will also issue guidance specific to their locations in line with the information below. Here are some important things you need to know about how the shelter in place of residence order affects the University: Faculty and staff should telework unless deemed essential to be on campus. All non-essential university offices will limit face-to-face interactions and move to virtual support to the general public at 5 p.m. today. All building entrances will revert to controlled access for faculty, staff, and students. We ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss any required on-campus staffing for your office. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Essential on-campus services will continue in support of students, faculty and staff. Even in a telework environment with few on-campus personnel, it is important that we continue to provide limited, yet essential on-campus services in support of students, faculty, and staff. For students, this includes on-campus housing, food service, and student health service as well as limited transportation to and from campus and restricted areas for computing labs and accessing wireless internet. All of these activities must be carried out using social distancing practices. Please see keeplearning.tamu.edu site and the main COVID-19 TAMU site for updates on available student services and hours of operation. Guidance to Faculty and Graduate Students and Continuity of Instruction: For faculty and graduate students who are teaching or supporting instruction, one essential priority is to continue our crucial online course instruction and activities needed to support teaching that will remain online at least through the end of the spring semester. We encourage faculty and graduate students who are teaching courses to develop methods that allow for the continuation of instruction that minimizes time on campus. Those individuals who need campus facilities to teach an online course can contact their respective department head for details on access.  Please refer to keepteaching.tamu.edu site for additional teaching resources. Staff Guidance: For staff, we ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss the expectations of your work arrangements. Please refer to earlier e-mails on the Human Resources web site on instructions for continuing work assignments. Ongoing Critical Services: Critical aspects of our business operations are considered essential under the orders and these will continue. These include but are not limited to: health services, food services that are available to-go, emergency responders, public safety, mail services, residence halls, janitorial and maintenance services, technology support, financial services, essential transportation services, airport, construction where approved, utilities and scientific research. Ongoing Research: Regarding ongoing scientific research, the Office of Research provides the following guidance: To the extent possible, Texas A&M researchers are encouraged to engage in activities that can be performed remotely (e.g., writing, data analysis, etc.); essential laboratory operations are permissible, provided they can be performed while meeting the “6-feet” requirement for social distancing. Graduate researchers may come to the research labs to conduct research activities that cannot be performed remotely. Paid undergraduate student workers may continue to carry out important support functions necessary for continuing laboratory operation. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Please seevpr.tamu.edu/covid-19 for additional information. Students must comply with applicable local government orders. In most cases, the orders allow students to leave their residence only for essential activities, such as going to the grocery store or picking up to-go meals on campus or from restaurants, visiting a healthcare professional and engaging in outdoor activity, such as walking, hiking, running, or riding a bicycle, with proper social distancing.  Students may also leave to go to university-designated locations for accessing computers and internet resources as indicated on keeplearning.tamu.edu. Please consult the central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. Student Health Including Counseling. For student counseling and student health, please refer to information provided by the Division of Student Affairs. Main Campus University Libraries will be closed to walk-in traffic. However, library personnel will continue digitizing resources to support online teaching. Access to all of the libraries’ digital resources and online research support will continue uninterrupted. We will continue to share information and updates by email, social media and on our central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. These are clearly difficult circumstances for everyone. We deeply appreciate the level of commitment of our faculty, staff and students in these challenging times. Michael K. Young President"

25-Mar-20,513,T_A&M_U,"March 25, 2020, 3:30 p.m. CDT Welcome back to classes this week! Dear Students, I would like to welcome everyone resuming classes at Texas A&M this week in a “new normal” online. Given the recent shelter in place at residence order from Brazos, Galveston and other counties impacting our campuses and sites, I also want to thank you for your tremendous patience and understanding during this challenging time. I was honored to be invited to join yesterday’s Facebook Live Virtual Town Hall Meeting hosted by Student body President Mikey Jaillet and Student body President-elect Eric Mendoza. Other senior university leaders and myself appreciated the engagement and opportunity to address what is on your minds as we were ""social distanced"" across multiple studios at KAMU and another building! As we continue to respond to new updates, I want to assure you that our top priority is your health and safety. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our faculty and staff, we have made major adjustments to bring everything online, greatly reducing the risk you face during this historic pandemic. For those who needed to return to our campuses, we have taken extensive measures to ensure your safety, with some buildings offering monitors to promote social distancing and all of our facilities providing enhanced procedures to promote public health. As new developments emerge, please visit the TAMU Central COVID-19 Website for coronavirus-related updates across a wide range of relevant topics. Campus remains open, but with classes moving online many of you have decided to stay home. To that end, all of our academic and support services are, to the extent possible, available virtually. I encourage you to visit the Keep Learning site for ongoing updates. For those of you who have decided to stay on campus, we will continue to provide essential services such as grab-and-go dining. Bus transportation will be available on campus, with limited passengers to ensure social distancing. Campus ATMs remain in operation. Please consult the central site or the Keep Learning site for building hours, as some academic buildings will remain accessible only for those who have key card access and will close by 5:00 p.m. Yesterday we were delighted to announce credits or refunds for on-campus housing, dining and parking for those who will no longer use these services this spring. While online classes have gone well so far, please understand that everything will not be perfect. During this unprecedented moment in our nation’s history, our faculty and staff have made enormous efforts to continue your education. However, there may still be logistical challenges that arise, and we may need to make changes to enhance your experience. As we get through this together, I want to assure you that Aggies will continue to learn and graduate from Texas A&M, moving on to engage in extraordinary acts of service to our state, our nation and world just as they have for more than 140 years. Thank you for your patience and understanding, and for making us all proud to say you are students at Texas A&M. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"

In an effort to help students, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level. For distance education degree programs with a program fee, there is no change in how they will be charged. At this time, we are planning for traditional, face-to-face delivery in the second summer term with a back-up plan for online delivery depending on the length of the current situation.  We will communicate final plans for the second summer session early enough for individuals to plan accordingly. Additionally, we are working to ensure we have a robust variety of summer coursework needed to make progress toward your degree. Registration begins March 30 and will continue as scheduled.

In order to protect Faculty, Staff, and Students who are at higher risk, departments will develop alternative plans allowing these individuals to accomplish their respective duties remotely. These alternative arrangements are to remain in place until further notice. Kevin McGinnis Chief Risk, Ethics, and Compliance Officer"
26-Mar-20,653,T_A&M_U,"March 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. CDT Howdy Ags, As loyal members of the Texas A&M community, I wanted you to have the latest information about our response to the coronavirus situation, which you can find in great detail at the Central TAMU COVID-19 site. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff – just as your highest priority is the wellbeing of your families and friends. At the same time, we are always dedicated to providing the very best educational opportunities under even the most challenging circumstances. To this end, our faculty and staff have made impressive efforts to quickly bring every one of our classes and all of our support services online, helping us protect every member of our academic community while providing the highest quality education we possibly can. If you’re interested in learning more, we’ve created a superb TAMU Keep Learning website to ensure our students’ continued success. In light of our capacity to support their education wherever they are located, many of our students have chosen to return home. We have a number of students for whom campus is their primary residence, and others who have chosen to remain on campus because that is the best alternative for their families and their education. To accommodate and support the continued success of those students, we are keeping our campuses and dorms open while taking extensive measures to ensure everyone’s safety, providing monitors for some buildings to promote social distancing and enhanced procedures to promote public health at all of our facilities. Our Student Health Services remain open and actively engaged. Those on campus will still have essential services such as grab-and-go dining, ATM access and bus transportation with social distancing. If you have questions about which areas of campus are open or operational, we again refer you to the TAMU Keep Learning site, which can provide you with the most up-to-date information. Like many of you, we’re deeply disappointed that this historic global pandemic has caused us to adjust certain cherished traditions that mean so much to so many Aggies. But I want to assure you that Muster in College Station and graduation ceremonies in May will still happen, just in a different way. We encourage students and families to celebrate with us virtually, keeping the Aggie spirit strong and connected, even as we are separated by distance. For those who do not have an opportunity to participate in graduation ceremonies in May, we are searching for ways to expand our in-person events in August. Our university enjoys one of the strongest networks in the world, and I know the economic pressures many of you face are real. To that end, I want to thank the dedicated leaders and teams at The Association of Former Students, The 12th Man Foundation, and The Texas A&M Foundation for always answering the call when we need them. Finally, because people like you always have a heart to serve and a desire to take care of other Aggies, many of you have contacted me asking how you can help during this difficult time. At the moment, our biggest need is support for our students whose lives have been dramatically disrupted by this unprecedented pandemic. Many face a number of unexpected expenses. Our goal is to help ensure that they can finish their classes, graduate on time, and move to serve our state, our nation and the world. We have now created a relief fund for our students administered by the university. If you’ve been looking for an opportunity to show your support, we would be delighted if you would donate to our student relief fund, which you can find here. During this unprecedented moment, thank you for your steadfast dedication and devotion to Texas A&M. All of us are deeply grateful for your passion for our university and for your compassion for our students. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"
1-Apr-20,309,T_A&M_U,"April 1, 2020, 3:50 p.m. CDT Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19 News Site Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and the Aggie Network, In recent weeks, our news feeds have been dominated by stories about the coronavirus (COVID-19). Behind the scenes at Texas A&M, many other stories are unfolding. These are the stories of hope and healing, of triumph over tragedy, of great compassion and selfless service. They are stories of faculty and staff who have risen to the occasion, of scholars and researchers creating innovations – sometimes by the hour – to meet emerging needs, of students who serve, of leading experts providing essential advice, of Aggies going above and beyond the call of duty. Today we launch a new site, Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19, created to house these exceptional stories in one place, to include some featured globally. Many more stories will be added here. You’ll see accounts of nurses graduating early to put their lives on the line so that they might save the lives of others. You’ll read about engineers who’ve designed a method for making protective masks, a mobile clinic transformed from a converted shipping container by creative students, as well as trusted advice about how to keep your loved ones safe and secure. From innovation to virtual engagement, from the economy to our society, from animals and agriculture to government and health, this informative site gives a glimpse of the extraordinary breadth and depth of knowledge and experience that Texas A&M brings to bear during this global pandemic. Texas A&M is a public university. We’re also a major force for the public good. As you read these stories, I hope you’ll take heart in the efforts made by our students, faculty and staff, as well as the comfort in knowing that Aggies always step forward to serve in times of great need. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"

We had hoped to resume coursework on campus for the second summer session, but with preregistration underway, some uncertainty on the apex of COVID19, and the need for both our students, faculty, and staff to plan, we have decided to move forward with the decision to teach all summer courses online. As we previously announced, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level for all students in traditional degree programs. For students enrolled in distance education degree programs, there is no change in how they will be charged. We continue to work with colleges to ensure that the university offers a robust schedule of summer coursework to ensure that students can make progress toward their degrees.

3-Apr-20,134,T_A&M_U,"April 3, 2020, 5:15 p.m. CDT Texas A&M faculty and staff who have access to personal protective equipment are being asked to donate whatever they can to help medical personnel and first-responders dealing with patients suffering from COVID-19. A&M has set up a survey that will go to officials with A&M’s Environmental Health and Safety department. They will then contact the individual to discuss collecting the items. Christina Robertson, Texas A&M’s director of Environmental Health & Safety who also serves on the logistics team for the Brazos County Community Emergency Operations Center, said she’s grateful for all the donations made to support the community’s healthcare providers and emergency responders. Officials with the county’s Emergency Operations Center said they can only accept manufactured items and are not able to take handmade masks or other supplies. "
29-Apr-20,662,T_A&M_U,"April 29, 2020, 9:00 a.m. CDT On Monday, Governor Abbott issued three executive orders and announced that he will allow Executive Order GA-14 to expire on April 30, 2020. GA-14 was issued on March 31 and required Texans to stay at home except to access essential services or provide essential services as an employee, or to engage in daily essential activities (e.g. grocery shopping) or certain outdoor activities. In Executive Order GA-18 issued Monday, Governor Abbott allows certain businesses to re-open and operate at limited capacity, such as restaurants, retail stores and movie theaters. The new Executive Order GA-18 still specifies that ""every person in Texas shall, except where necessary to obtain essential services or reopened services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household."" Specifically, the orders do not reduce most guidance for social distancing, gatherings of 10 or more people, personal hygiene or best practice regarding monitoring your personal health. Furthermore, social gatherings and events are still not permitted. OGC has analyzed the three executive orders issued on Monday and does not believe that they will have a significant impact on university operations, given the changes that we have already implemented. Thus, Texas A&M University will continue its current mode of operations until further notice. We will continue to monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our planning as changing conditions may require. At Texas A&M University, instruction, research and operations have already adjusted to previous guidance, as well as our own assessment of public health impacts across our campuses and educational sites. We will be continuing our standing guidance at this time. This includes: Completion of the Spring Semester via remote/online instruction and finals testing; Campuses and educational sites remain closed to visitors through May 31; Campus commencement ceremonies for Spring 2020 are postponed, with individual branch campus or professional schools providing information on their plans for their graduates. More information will be posted on the Texas A&M graduation page; Summer I, Summer II and 10 Week Summer session will all be delivered by remote/online instruction; Youth Camps on Texas A&M campuses and sites remain cancelled through June 30. Decision for July and August youth camps will be announced on or before May 15; A number of university facilities and services remain accessible to authorized personnel until June 1 with additional guidance expected on or before that date; University research operations remain limited, unless previously authorized by exception from Vice President for Research. Additional information about increasing research activity on campus will be forthcoming on or before May 18. Individual faculty and staff guidance issued by your supervisor remain in effect as appropriate and as updated to fit your individual responsibilities. Access will remain available to the workplace for employees, as is the case today, and most employees will continue to work remotely from home. We anticipate bringing more employees back to the workplace in the near future, and expect a phased approach that calls for the return of certain employees as soon as mid-May with other employees returning in June and still others in July or August. To the extent that work from home is possible, it should continue for medically vulnerable individuals and parents with children at home. We continue to monitor guidance from public health authorities, The Texas A&M University System, and The Office of the Governor to ensure appropriate health and safety for our university and communities. We anticipate additional guidance and announcements regarding our university operations no later than June 1. We appreciate your continued efforts to work, teach, learn and operate Texas A&M University in new and different ways at this time. We applaud your efforts which have helped to limit the impacts of COVID-19 and welcome your continued collaboration in the weeks and months to come. Remember to take care of each other, maintain social distancing, stay home if you are ill and practice frequent hand washing! Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"

Just thinking about how you – the largest student body in the nation – rapidly responded to so many changes is both humbling and awe-inspiring: More than 1,000 of you quickly adapting international travel plans, with more than 280 of you safely returning from overseas and self-isolating when asked to do so; More than 57,000 of you participating in online classes, working with faculty across nearly 13,800 class sections; and Many of you answering the call to serve as only Aggies do – including nursing students who opted to expedite your instruction early and members of the military who were activated. Thank you! Next week, 10,796 of you are expected to graduate. While spring commencement, as we know, has been postponed, we will mark in a number of special ways the conferral of degrees. This summer, we’re fully online and enrollment is actually up, a sign that you remain undeterred in pursuing your goals. We will advise about plans for August commencement by the end of May. In the fall, our Aggiebound Aggies numbers are also up. While we know online classes are an option if needed, we plan to be fully open and operational, with dedicated faculty and staff leaning into preparing for all the requirements necessary to do so safely across academics, athletics and campus activities. We will continue to keep you updated in detail for plans to open responsibly, and will, of course, follow updated federal, state officials and healthcare guidance that dictate our ability to do so. It’s been quite a semester! We love you and wish you and your families safety and happiness as we continue to move forward together. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President"

28-Feb-20,"Dear FSU Family,

Florida State University continues to closely monitor advisories and updates from the Centers for Disease Control concerning the COVID-19 coronavirus that has spread to many countries.

The safety of our students, faculty and staff is our paramount concern. As we head into spring break and many people are on the move, I want to update you on actions the university is taking to protect our campus community.

FSU has suspended travel to China and South Korea, where the warning level has been set by the CDC at Level 3. Travelers are not authorized to travel to these nations until further notice.

Heightened levels of alert also exist for Japan, Iran and Italy, which currently are at Level 2. We have suspended university related faculty and staff travel to those countries, as well, without approval of your divisions vice president. If you do visit any countries with the above warning levels or any affected area we strongly encourage you to self-isolate for a quarantine period of 14 days when you return.

In an abundance of caution, FSU canceled classes at its Florence Study Center for the week. We have not closed our residences in Florence in case some students want to remain in place during that programs spring break. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Italy, and around the globe. Information regarding all summer programs will be updated by the end of March.

We also have identified and contacted FSU students in the affected countries who are traveling as exchange students, as well as faculty or staff who were traveling on FSU business, to assist them. Please contact the university as soon as possible if you require assistance and have not yet been contacted.

No cases of the virus have been reported at FSU or confirmed in the state of Florida, and the risk is considered low, but the university is being proactive. FSU is coordinating with the Leon County Health Department and the Florida Department of Health to review protocols in preparation for the possibility of a case here.

For now, I encourage you to do your part to protect yourself and others. There is no vaccine at this time to prevent the virus and no specific treatment that is recommended. The CDC advises that the best thing to do is avoid being exposed and stay healthy by taking everyday actions against respiratory illness such as washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and getting a flu shot. Additional health information is provided on the FSU Alert page. (alerts.fsu.edu)

Most importantly, if you have a respiratory illness or fever, please stay home. We will work with the deans and faculty to accommodate students who are ill, and we urge sick faculty and staff to work with your dean, department head or supervisor to coordinate coverage of your responsibilities.

For faculty and staff matters related to this issue, please contact Tracey Pearson (staff) at 850-644-3694 or Rebecca Peterson (faculty) at 850-645-2202, both in the Office of Human Resources.

Students at our Florida campuses can contact the University Health Services (UHS) Administrative Office at 850-645-0620.

If you are an FSU student currently enrolled in one of our study abroad programs, please contact the Office of International Programs with any questions or concerns.

As the spread of the coronavirus continues to develop, more countries are likely to be added to the list of those to avoid. Please consult the FSU Alert website for regular updates in the coming days and keep yourself informed about this important health issue. There are multiple links provided on the site with helpful information, or visit:  www.cdc.gov .

3-Mar-20,"Florida State University is taking aggressive steps to prevent the spread of disease, such as COVID-19, by promoting healthy habits and enhancing its existing cleaning and disinfection practices.

This cannot be achieved without the help of the entire campus community. First and foremost, this means engaging in healthy habits such as washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds; covering your cough or sneeze; avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth; avoiding those who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Signage promoting this is posted throughout campus.

University partners including Facilities, Recreation, Housing, and others have reviewed cleaning protocols and products and are taking extra measures to disinfect frequently touched areas like doorknobs, stair rails, elevator buttons and other surfaces (such as exercise equipment and classroom AV equipment). High traffic areas such as student housing, libraries, dining halls, bathrooms, locker rooms, as well as recreation centers also receive more cleanings. Additionally, Star Metro buses are cleaned daily and being deep cleaned weekly.

There is no vaccine to prevent this virus, and the CDC advises that the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Here are everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
If you have a respiratory illness or fever, please stay home. University administrators will work with the deans and faculty to accommodate students who are ill, and sick faculty and staff are urged to work with their dean, department head or supervisor to coordinate coverage of your responsibilities.

If you have spent time in an area with an alert in place, you will need to monitor your symptoms when you return. If during the past 14 days you feel sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing, please do the following

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctors office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to an area with community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others and do not travel while sick.
Avoid using public transportation if possible. University Health Services offers courtesy transportation to and from the University Health Center for students on the main campus only (main campus students may call the Medical Response Unit at 850-644-3349 to request courtesy",Florida State University

10-Mar-20,"Florida State University has suspended ALL international university-related travel to prevent the potential spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).   

International travel requests will require approval by a university vice president until further notice. ANY international travel must be deemed essential in order to be approved by the travelers vice president.  

Florida State University requests that all individuals who have traveled internationally for work or personal reasons to comply with new university guidelines, based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) recommendations:   

 Travel to CDC Level 2 &3 Countries and all Cruises: mandatory 14-day self-quarantine upon reentry into the United States  
The CDC and U.S. State Department strongly discourage all travel by cruise ships worldwide.    
If you travel to any other area with community transmission, contact the Division of Student Affairs or Department of Human Resources if you need to self-quarantine or self-isolate. Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown. If it cannot be connected to travel, then it suggests that community transmission is occurring. 

Have a plan  
With spring break approaching, we strongly recommend you formulate a plan in case you are required to self-quarantine for a 14-day period for any reason (including illness, international and all cruise ship travel or close contact with a COVID-19 case).   

Your plan should include a possible quarantine location that is not a shared living space, residence hall or multi-occupancy apartment. 

All students should take all necessary academic course materials with them when they depart for spring break, in case they need to resume their spring courses remotely from home. 

FSU will continue to follow CDC, state and county health department guidelines, which means those who are required to self-quarantine, should practice social distancing as explained here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html    

If a student needs to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework remotely.  

New FSU coronavirus webpage  
The university has created a new website to aggregate all the universitys coronavirus information, messaging and instructions. Please refer to fsu.edu/coronavirus for the latest official updates on coronavirus (COVID-19), including a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). The page will be updated frequently.  

The FSU Alert webpage will remain the online location for urgent emergency information and instructions. Continue to visit alerts.fsu.edu anytime the operational status of the university may be in question (e.g., severe weather or dangerous situations).  

University guidance for possible encounters with COVID-19  
No cases of the virus have been reported at FSU, but the university is being proactive to prevent the spread of COVID-19.   

If you have recently returned from travel to an event or location (e.g., a conference or other large gathering) where a potential novel coronavirus COVID-19 case occurred or was present, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends self-quarantine only for individuals who were in close contact with a case of COVID-19. The CDC defines close contact as being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on).   

If you were NOT in close contact with a case of COVID-19, here are some reminders on what to do to keep yourself healthy:  

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  
Stay home when you are sick.  
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.  
If you WERE in close contact with a case of COVID-19, or during the next 14 days you feel sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing, please do the following:  

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctors office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to an area with potential community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.  
Avoid contact with others and do not travel while sick.  
Avoid using public transportation if possible.  
Please notify the university if you self-quarantine or self-isolate   
Students who self-quarantine and need assistance should contact Tyler Shannon in Case Management Services, at tdshannon@fsu.edu  or 850-644-9561.   

As previously mentioned, if a student needs to self-quarantine or self-isolate, the university has made plans for them to be able to continue with their coursework remotely.  

For faculty or staff matters related to this issue, please contact Tracey Pearson (staff) at 850-644-3694 or Rebecca Peterson (faculty) at 850-645-2202, both in the Office of Human Resources.  ",Florida State University
12-Mar-20,Quarantining in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but are not yet symptomatic from others who have not been exposed to prevent the possible spread of the disease.

12-Mar-20,"Florida State University continues to monitor the COVID-19 Coronavirus situation closely. At this time, there are no reported cases on campus or in Tallahassee and Leon County. There is no immediate risk for the FSU campus. The University shifted to online courses as a mitigation strategy to reduce the amount of people on campus. This was a crucial preventative measure due to spring break and the various travel plans of our students. Faculty and staff who travel to impacted areas during this time, should also follow recommendations to self-isolate. However, it is strongly recommended that all faculty, staff, and students refrain from domestic and international travel except for emergency purposes.

Being Prepared

It is important for all employees to be prepared for remote work in the event of an outbreak. However, because there are currently no reported cases of COVID-19 in the area, employees are expected to adhere to their normal work hours and locations, whenever possible. If there are individual circumstances that warrant an employee working remotely, contact the Office of Human Resources. These situations will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This is an evolving situation and procedures will be updated based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control  (CDC), the Florida Department of Health  (FDOH), and World Health Organization  (WHO). For the most up-to-date announcements regarding the Universitys response to COVID-19, please refer to the FSU Coronavirus page.

We strongly recommend you formulate a plan in case you are required to self-quarantine for a 14-day period for any reason. If you travel to any other area with an outbreak, contact the Office of Human Resources if you need to self-quarantine or self-isolate.

FSU Workplace Policies

Faculty and Staff play an important role in helping transition coursework to online content and continuing the operations of the institution. Understandably, there are many questions about how preventative self-quarantine and the possibility of remote work and moving classes online, impact existing Human Resources Policies. The Office of Human Resources has provided specific guidance for faculty and staff questions related to our policies. The Coronavirus Workplace Guidance page and FAQs provide full details to assist faculty and staff during this time.

Due to the statewide closure of all K-12 schools and guidance from health officials, effective Tuesday, March 17, we are encouraging employees whose job duties are conducive to remote work, to do so with appropriate approval. Departments may not shut down and are expected to remain open with the appropriate coverage (with full-time salaried employees) to ensure the University remains fully operational. Employees must still be able to perform the essential functions of their respective positions, remotely or in person. Special consideration should be given to employees with underlying health issues that may increase the severity of infection should they come in contact with COVID-19.

For employees who are not able to perform their essential job functions remotely, we ask that departments and supervisors be flexible with leave approvals when necessary when personal circumstances warrant. Departments are advised to develop a temporary schedule to rotate shifts for employees who need to be on campus to perform their work duties or keep the department operational to promote social distancing. In addition, departments such as FSUPD, Emergency Management, Facilities, Environmental Health and Safety, Health and Wellness, Human Resources, Controllers Office, Procurement, University Libraries, Housing, Information Technology Services, and Campus Recreation are considered essential and should ensure the appropriate on-campus coverage to support institutional needs.

Human Resources will temporarily remove any childcare requirements for remote work and provide automatic, immediate approval upon receipt of the completed Temporary Remote Work Guidelines Acknowledgement . While some employees will have the option to work from home, please remember that minor children should not be on campus. The guidelines regarding minors in the workplace are available in the FSU & You  handbook.

Additional information on the University Temporary Remote Work Policy Guidelines (including eligible and ineligible positions) and instructions for coordinating with Human Resources can be found here.

The University is working hard to remain flexible as we continue to follow the guidance of health professionals. It remains our paramount goal to keep our entire campus community safe by proactively mitigating risk to our employees.

This message to all students, faculty and staff has been approved by FSU President John Thrasher. 

Florida State University will follow the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State University System of Florida (SUS) by extending the previously announced period of online instruction for all academic courses through the remainder of the spring semester. This move to online instruction includes the FSU Panama City campus. 

These steps are necessary, and, as disappointing as they may be, are in the best interest of our entire community. All of the universitys immediate efforts continue to be focused on supporting our faculty, staff and students. 

At this time, there are still no reported cases of COVID-19 at Florida State University or in Leon County. 

Tuesday, the State University System of Florida directed all state universities to extend remote instruction through the end of the spring semester. The SUS also encouraged all students who can return home to do so. 

In addition, the State University System announced all traditional on-campus commencement ceremonies will not be held as scheduled and directed each university to develop an alternate schedule or method of delivery.  

President Thrasher and the entire administration recognize that commencement is a joyous time for our students and their families. The university is working to develop an alternative commencement plan to celebrate all of our deserving graduates impacted this spring. Details will be announced at a later date. 

Florida State University is on spring break this week. As the university previously announced, academic courses will resume after spring break via distance learning, beginning Monday, March 23. FSU is prepared to finish the spring semester via distance learning and other alternative methods as directed. 

While university administrators strongly recommend students follow the SUS guidance to return home if possible, residence halls at Florida State remain open to those student residents who previously opted to stay on campus during spring break.  

Those students will be allowed to remain in the residence halls through the end of the spring semester. However, they will not be allowed to return to their residence hall if they travel away from Tallahassee for any reason before the end of the semester. 

Students who departed Tallahassee for spring break should not return to campus for any reason until further notice. Specific instructions for the retrieval of personal belongings from campus and residence hall move-out will be announced at a later date. 

Students who choose to leave campus should take with them any and all belongings. 

FSU administrators emphasized the spring semester is not over, and students are expected attend their classes online beginning Monday, March 23, for the remainder of the semester. 

Faculty and staff are expected to report to work as normal in their regularly assigned work locations. Florida State is encouraging employees whose job duties are conducive to remote work, to do so with appropriate approval. 

Florida States highest priority remains the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff. University officials will continue to proactively monitor and follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Florida Department of Health and other medical authorities. 

Administrators understand our students and families have a lot of questions, and they are working to quickly address the issues and questions that will naturally follow. For students currently in campus housing, the university will provide additional guidance as soon as possible.  

FSU will continue to do all it can operationally, academically and morally to support our students, faculty and staff.

19-Mar-20,"Dear Spring Graduates, 

As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread around the world, Florida State University is committed to protecting the health and safety of the university community, as well as our families and friends. 

One of the best ways to stop the spread of this dangerous disease is to avoid large gatherings and crowds. Thats why FSU and all State University System of Florida institutions have canceled this springs commencement ceremonies. 

While it is extraordinarily disappointing to cancel one of lifes most joyous occasions, this is a necessary step to keep our community safe.  

I understand this is upsetting news for our graduates and their families, friends, faculty and mentors. This years commencement was to be extra special for Jean and me, and our immediate family, as my granddaughter is graduating alongside you, so I certainly understand and share your disappointment. This should be a time when graduates are lining up at Westcott Fountain to take photos in their caps and gowns, laughing with friends at the Senior Toast and reflecting on their journeys of academic and personal growth.  



Ive said many times that nothing makes me happier than seeing our students realize their dreams of an FSU degree, and please be assured that we will celebrate your important milestone when it is safe to do so. 

In the meantime, the university plans to release an online ceremony that includes messages from the academic deans, the dean of the Graduate School and the dean of Undergraduate Studies, who will confer academic degrees to our deserving graduates.  

Once circumstances allow, FSU plans to invite our Spring 2020 graduates and their families and friends back to campus to enjoy a true celebration of their achievements.  

Over the past few years, we have faced many challenges, and I have always been impressed by your resilience. Together, we will get through this, too. I urge you to stay safe, use good judgement and finish the semester strong! 

Sincerely,

20-Mar-20,"Amid a global pandemic, Florida State University is mobilizing to protect the health and safety of the university community by delivering classes remotely for the remainder of the spring semester.

With an enrollment of about 42,000 students and more than 3,000 faculty and instructors, the transition from in-person classes to remote teaching is a huge undertaking.

This is something weve never done at this level of magnitude before for our faculty as well as our students, said FSU President John Thrasher. I want the students to continue to get the kind of education they came to Florida State for. Our faculty wants to deliver that education. This is just a new mode of doing that, and I think it can be successful.

While Thrasher knows its not an ideal situation, hes encouraging everyone to work together and be patient as FSU begins a new era of education.



The confidence I have in our faculty is overwhelming, he said. I know theyre working hard to make it happen. We had a nice meeting with the deans and chairs earlier in the week and theyre all committed to making this work because theyre committed to our students, and thats what this faculty is about. Theyre strong.

Provost Sally McRorie and the Academic Affairs team have been preparing to shift classes online for weeks. Theyre following an emergency model FSU put together in 2018, when Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida Panhandle and prompted the FSU Panama City campus to move to remote learning.

As COVID-19 cases have risen around the state and the nation, its been an all-hands-on-deck project to make sure students avoid any disruption Ñ or delays Ñ in their academic journeys.

This is certainly an unprecedented experience for all of us at Florida State, but we are very resilient and proud to be, McRorie said. We are facing it head on.

She said her team has been extremely busy trying to work through all the various new ways faculty and students have to approach teaching and learning. McRorie reinforced that student success is one of Florida States top priorities and that faculty and staff are dedicated to making sure FSU students have the best experience possible.

There will be some little glitches along the way, probably more so the beginning of next week, when all classes will be taught remotely, McRorie said, but we have great learning teams, teaching teams, we have terrific resources in our IT department and our Office of Distance Learning, along with great support for teaching and learning everywhere in the university.

The Office of Distance Learning is using a variety of different tools, including Zoom, an online video conferencing service, and Canvas, FSUs learning management system, to make that happen.

We applied the academic and technology resources at our disposal to help make this happen on short notice, said Robert Fuselier, director of the Office of Distance Learning. Were trying to help faculty create meaningful activities for students.

Kim Houghton, a business analyst with the Office of Distance Learning, said the goal is to offer some very basic steps that every faculty member would need to know to get some initial success online.

Our approach is more of a quick start guide, Houghton said. Once they get used to a few basic tools, then there are so many resources that were prepared to offer. We didnt want to overwhelm someone who had never taught online.

Fuselier said his team has focused on helping faculty who are primarily researchers and teach a few classes but who dont have a lot of interaction with academic technology.

The key is were trying to keep it as simple and approachable as possible, and the people have really taken it and run with it, he said.

Florida State prides itself on smaller classes and face-to-face opportunities and that is one of the hurdles faculty will have to overcome, McRorie said.

Those will be different, but we can still find ways to challenge students and to provide them many opportunities for learning, she said.

Different people have different strategies that seem to work for them, Fuselier added.

Theres been a lot of different approaches, and it will be interesting to see what happens because this is also a time when I think there is going to be a lot of ideas that we would like to capture and learn about, he said.

Thrasher said FSUs resilience is unparalleled, and the university will navigate any challenges together.

Were the 18th best public university in America, and were going to come out of this just as strong as we were and make this university even stronger, Thrasher said. Thats because our faculty cares about what happens to our students, and our students want to get the best education they can so they can go out and follow their dreams.

25-Mar-20,"Some of the most memorable experiences for Florida State University students happen outside of the classroom. Now, with the university going remote for the rest of the spring semester amid a global pandemic, how will students stay connected with campus and one another?

One way that Florida State is supporting students is through Virtual FSU  a new, virtual hub for student services and engagement opportunities, created by the Division of Student Affairs.

Its important that while we are physically distant, we connect virtually with each other for our mental and physical health, said Amy Hecht, vice president for Student Affairs. Our goal is to continue, as best we can, offering the FSU experience and providing avenues for students to receive counseling, medical services and connecting with each other through a variety of online mechanisms. I know that our students are resilient, and we will all support each other during this time of uncertainty.

Virtual FSU includes information for virtual health and wellness, mental health services, the Career Center, Food Pantry, case management support as well as links to opportunities to be active, meet about wellness and find engaging things to do online.

Building and fostering digital communities is an extension of the work we do daily to craft the student experience and help students reach their full potential, said Danielle Acosta, interim director of Student Engagement. Through these platforms, we can engage in conversations, build relationships, continue to provide interactive services to support student success and empower students to positively impact the world. This is more important now than ever, as we are seeing in real time how truly interconnected that we are and how each of us have the opportunity to change the trajectory for others.

In addition to Virtual FSU, Students Affairs plans to further develop different and creative ways for student connection, celebration and ongoing virtual services.

For example, the DSA is hosting a new virtual event each Wednesday  RSO Rendezvous  in place of FSUs usual Market Wednesday on Legacy Walk. RSO Rendezvous will take place during the regular Market Wednesday time, from 10 a.m. 1 p.m.

Student Engagement is excited to use our online platforms and technology to continue to help RSOs thrive and be creative during this time, Acosta said. We are setting up social media challenges, creating new virtual experiences and helping students use resources that they may not have even known existed to continue doing some of their favorite activities critical to their FSU experience.

Other departments and groups around campus are getting in the virtual act, too. The Student Government Association, including FSUs Student Senate and Congress of Graduate Students, will meet virtually on a summer schedule for the remainder of the semester, and the College of Law has developed a virtual hub with daily lunchtime programming for students via Zoom that is accessible through the Office of Student Advancement Canvas page for Law students.

Student engagement is all about the connections and investment we have in each other, and in the Florida State community, Acosta said. Our community, the Florida State family, is strong, and one that comes together in trying and difficult times. This spring, we might not all physically be out on Landis Green or having dinner in the Ballrooms, but we are still in this together. We can still cheer each other, be involved, learn together, and support and celebrate each other.

25-Mar-20,"Dear Students,

This is an unprecedented time in Florida State Universitys history as the entire campus has moved to remote learning, and we realize this may be a difficult adjustment for some students.

In response, FSU has modified its undergraduate grading policy for the 2020 spring semester.

Undergraduate courses that now use letter grades will continue to use letter grades. However, students may individually opt to receive a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grade for eligible courses rather than a letter grade.
Students enrolled in undergraduate courses may request S/U in eligible courses beginning at 9 a.m. ET Monday, March 30. All requests for the S/U option must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, April 12. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Student Information Guide on S/U to understand the implications of their choice should they choose to switch from letter grades to S/U grades. The students who request the S/U option will be informed how their choice may affect financial aid, progress toward degree, etc. Academic advisors also can help students in the decision-making process should students have additional questions.
Students may select to change one or all of the eligible undergraduate classes in which they are enrolled. There is no requirement that students change any course if they wish to continue receiving a letter grade for any or all of their eligible undergraduate classes.
To be clear, students may not opt for S/U status after 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, April 12.
Beginning March 30, students should consult their instructors as to what would constitute an S or U in each class. It may be different.
The grading policy for graduate courses will not change. All graduate courses will receive letter grades.
Students in professional programs should check with their respective colleges for any grading policy changes.
To request S/U in classes that use letter grades, see instructions on How to Change Letter Grades to S/U Grades .

The FSU Foundation, the universitys academic fundraising arm, unveiled two emergency funds that are accepting donations  one addressing the needs of those affiliated with FSU in Tallahassee, the other for those from FSU Panama City.

All funds will go to FSU students and will cover a variety of needs from medical bills, rent, living expenses and technology to help distance learning.

The Foundation has launched a webpage, foundation.fsu.edu/emergency , where visitors can pick a fund and send their donation. The effort mirrors the one initiated by FSU in the wake of Hurricane Michael which allowed donors to contribute online and raised more than $150,000.

In an email to the university community, FSU President John Thrasher called for a similar response and said FSU needed to move quickly to help support those in need.

These student emergency funds were created to quickly address a variety of our students needs  from food insecurity and medical bills to technology and housing assistance, he said.

Officials also announced that proceeds raised from this years edition of FSUs Great Give, which is postponed until April 7, will be used to support the student emergency funds.

Funds will be distributed as needed and financial support is identified.

Donations to these funds will have an immediate impact, said Tom Jennings, vice president for University Advancement and president of the FSU Foundation. Even though our student community is physically spread far and wide, we are dedicated to doing everything possible to ensure they can succeed in this time of crisis.

Thrasher also reminded people to visit the university food pantry Amazon Wish List  to see which items are in greatest demand.

Gifts can be made online using credit card, debit card or PayPal at https://give.fsu.edu/studentemergency  for the Tallahassee campus student emergency fund or https://give.fsu.edu/pcstudents  for the Panama City campus student emergency fund.

Gifts may also be made via check payable to the FSU Foundation. Reference Fund F08909 for the Tallahassee campus or Fund F08686 for the Panama City campus.

Florida State University will implement a Student Refund Plan for students who have paid or have been assessed housing and dining charges for the Spring 2020 semester and are no longer utilizing these services, with the following considerations:

March 23, 2020 is considered the last service date for housing and meal plans.
For University Housing residents, we will refund the respective spring semester rate per individual resident based on their number of unutilized bed nights and the specific rate for the residence hall in which they lived.
For students on the Residential Dining Services All-Access Meal Plan, we will refund the respective spring semester rate per unused days and Flex Bucks. Block Meal Plans will be refunded based on the unused meal balance and Flex Bucks. Garnet Bucks will automatically roll over based on the Meal Plan Terms and Conditions.
Refunds will be applied to students university accounts. Any university balance will be paid prior to the refund being disbursed.
Acceptance of the refunds will constitute full resolution of the students residence hall and meal plan agreements.
We expect to electronically issue refunds the week of April 6. This will allow us time to calculate refund amounts and ensure all refunds are compliant with financial aid rules based on U.S. Department of Education and State of Florida guidance.

1-Apr-20,"As a result of Governor DeSantis safer at home order, the University is restricting all on-campus operations to essential functions only effective April 3, 2020, until at least April 30, 2020. The restriction of on-campus operations means that only essential personnel are required on campus. However, University business operations will continue and faculty and staff who are working remotely should continue to work their normal hours. If an employee working remotely needs to return to campus prior to the Governors executive order going into effect to gather work items, they must continue to practice appropriate social distancing.

On-Campus Essential Employees

At this time, on campus essential employees are defined as employees designated to report to the workplace while on-campus operations are restricted. Vice Presidents, Deans, Directors, and Department Heads must designate which on-campus functions are essential and require an employee to be on-campus to perform critical on-campus University functions. On campus essential personnel that may be required to work on campus include, but are not limited to:

those ensuring the safety and security of campus facilities and information technology; protection of University assets (e.g., health care services, police);
maintenance of research labs and utilities that cannot suspend operations;
those providing limited services to students who remain on-campus (e.g. housing, designated food services);
those required for continuity of services including maintenance/grounds/janitorial
those providing medical services;
those who are needed to process financial transactions and services;
those who provide support for information technology; and
those facilitating distance learning.
Leave for on campus essential employees may be approved for employees that have a qualifying sick reason; are required to self-quarantine due to travel outside of the Tallahassee area and surrounding counties; or due to a recommendation by a health care provider. Please consult with your immediate supervisor prior to traveling outside of the Tallahassee area and surrounding counties.

Some employees may be designated as on campus essential employees but may not be needed for full-time work. Those employees must work the hours that are required and then will be provided Emergency Sick Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) to supplement the additional hours. For example, an employee may only be required to report to campus to perform essential duties for 20 hours, and then will be provided 20 hours of FFCRA Emergency Sick Leave. Additionally, departments should consider alternative schedules for essential employees to promote social distancing.

Remote Work Employees

All employees who are not designated as on campus essential employees will be required to work remotely, as long as their duties and responsibilities are conducive to such work. Although on campus operations are restricted, remote work will continue. Employees are still required to submit a Temporary Remote Work Acknowledgement form. Please visit the Temporary Remote Work Guidelines webpage for additional resources and guidance.

The Universitys restriction of on campus operations will include significantly reducing the amount of facilities staff available to provide the usual cleaning and sanitation services in University Academic and Research buildings. As a result, we cannot guarantee that facilities will be maintained on a daily basis in a manner that meets with best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For these reasons, and for your own continued health and safety, the University must insist that all employees not designated as on campus essential work remotely at all possible times. If there are additional measures you need in order accomplish remote work, please advise your department head or chair.

Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)

Employees whose job responsibilities do not support remote work and who are not considered to be on campus essential employees, or are unable to work remotely due to childcare or other COVID-19 related reasons, will be granted up to 80 hours (prorated for part-time employees) of Emergency Sick Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). Employees are required to submit the Emergency Paid Sick Leave  form to initiate the paid leave. Once a salaried non-essential employee (Faculty, USPS, and A&P) has exhausted their 80-hour entitlement, they will qualify for paid administrative leave through April 30, 2020. If the University restricts on campus operations beyond April 30, leave statuses will be reevaluated at that time.

How Should Departments Prepare?

Departments should prepare immediately for a shutdown of nonessential campus operations. Supervisors must work with employees who are able to work remotely to ensure they have access to all the equipment, files, resources, etc. that they need to perform their work from home. Most of this planning has already occurred, but access to buildings will be limited to those that are designated as essential. Supervisors must keep in mind social distancing when coordinating the pick-up of items that employees may need.

Departmental Mail and Packages

Departments should continue to process their mail to ensure the timely deposit of checks and processing of vendor invoices/payments. Campus mail will continue to be delivered to departmental mailrooms on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If a department would like to pick up mail at Postal Services (800 West Madison Street), please send an email to postal@fsu.edu  with the full name of the departmental representative authorized to pick up mail for the department. This person must be prepared to show their current University issued identification (FSUCard).

Packages received by Postal Services will be held for department pick up. If you are working remotely from home, you may ship ordered items to your home address with appropriate departmental approval and documentation. Click here for more information.

If your high school term extends beyond our June 22 start date, we will work with you either to adjust your Summer term start date or switch your admission to our Fall term which begins August 24.

I may not be able to get my official high school transcript showing my high school graduation before the Summer term starts. Is that a problem? We are aware of this possibility. This will not be a problem and it will not keep you from starting classes in the Summer. Just get the final transcript to us as soon as it becomes available.

I wont have my AP, IB, or Cambridge results before Summer starts. How do I know what classes to take? During Orientation, you should speak with your advisor about the credit you think you will earn. Your advisor will help you select classes that will not conflict with the credit you might earn via exam results.

Will campus be open for the Fall term or will it be online? At this time, the Fall 2020 term is scheduled to begin on August 24 as normal. In the event it becomes necessary to make a change, we will notify all students immediately.

What about my immunizations and health insurance requirements? FSU is aware of the challenges students may be experiencing obtaining immunizations in light of the current novel coronavirus pandemic. University Health Services will provide temporary deferments to allow for class registration. Deferments are approved on a case-by-case basis. If you are unable to meet your immunization requirement, please contact the UHS health compliance staff. The University requires that students have health insurance, but if you have specific concerns or questions, please contact the UHS health compliance staff. 

Summer Classes 
Do I need anything special to take online courses? You will need a computer with speakers and internet access at a minimum. A web camera, either as part of the computer or as an add-on, is preferred. Additional information about computer specifics are available if you have questions. You can learn more about the technical requirements and the essential online tools and applications you need in the Student Guide to Learning Online and this Tips for Learning Online. 

I am not sure that I have everything I need to take online courses. Is there someone I can contact about my situation? If you have a question about your hardware or software, please contact The ITS Service Desk which can provide assistance or referrals to additional support services. If you do not have a computer or internet availability, please contact Case Management Services at casemanagement@fsu.edu . 

How many classes will I be expected to take? The typical course load for a summer term is two courses or 6 semester hours, but you may take up to 9 semester hours. Your advisor during Orientation can help you decide how many hours to take. 

What type of classes will be available? Summer course offerings will be very similar to previous years. Seats in many popular summer classes have been reserved for incoming students and you can discuss options with your advisor during Orientation. Most students focus on pre-requisites for their major and General Education courses to get started, and these will be widely available.

Will I be able to meet with an academic advisor to help me pick the right classes? You will have an opportunity to meet with an academic advisor during Orientation. They will help you choose and enroll in appropriate summer classes.

After I register for classes, can I make changes to my schedule? Changing your schedule after you have selected your courses is known as Drop/Add. You have until the end of the first week of classes to adjust your schedule by adding or dropping a course. This process will be explained as part of Orientation.

How do I get my textbooks or other required class materials? All books and other class materials may be purchased through the FSU bookstore  and shipped to your house. 

I have special learning needs. Is there someone I can contact about my situation? Students can apply for learning accommodation services through the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS). You may apply for services at any time during the semester, but the OAS will require at least seven (7) days to process your application and schedule the intake meeting. The application is available online.

Do I need proof of immunizations and health insurance to start in the summer? Yes. FSU is aware of the challenges students may be experiencing in obtaining immunizations in light of the current novel coronavirus pandemic. University Health Services will still be adherent to the Universitys policies and procedures regarding immunizations but will provide temporary waivers to allow for class registration until students return to campus in order to accommodate for the difficulties you may be currently encountering in obtaining immunizations. The University requires that students have health insurance, but if you have specific concerns or questions, please contact the UHS health compliance staff.

I am thinking about taking a math class but am not sure which one will be best for me.  FSU uses the online ALEKS math placement test, which is administered online. If you need to take the test, you will receive registration information via email. You must take the test before attending Orientation.

I am thinking about taking a language class. Is there anything special I need to do? For those students who have initiated foreign language study prior to entering Florida State University (specifically in high school where no college credit was awarded), selection of the appropriate language course level is extremely important. For that reason, a mandatory (no cost) placement test is required for all students who plan to continue study in either French, German, or Spanish and have not already received college credit for that language. Students who are studying a new language which they did not study in high school, and for which they have no other experience, are not required to take such a test but would enroll in the 1120 level of the language of interest. Please go here for more information about language placement testing. 

Are online courses harder than face to face courses? Online courses are not more difficult than face-to-face courses. The difference is how they are designed to support your learning. Instructors in online courses utilize many technologies and strategies to support your learning and connect you with fellow students. These strategies may be different than what you are used to experiencing in an in-person class. FSU faculty are committed to providing quality learning opportunities, regardless of delivery method.

How often do online classes meet? Classes will be either synchronous (taught live) or asynchronous (online with no scheduled meeting time). Heres how to tell the difference:

Classes with specific days/time listed: These are synchronous classes. The class will meet virtually at those times via Zoom or other technologies. The registration system will not allow you to enroll in remote, synchronous classes with overlapping times. 

Classes with days/time listed as TBA: These are asynchronous classes. The class will not meet virtually at a specific time and will use other teaching methods like recorded videos so coursework can be done at your convenience. 

 Will the online courses be pass/fail or graded? Summer online courses will receive letter grades. For more information on the FSU grading policy go here. 

Tuition, Fees, & Financial Aid 
How much will my classes cost? Tuition and Fees are assessed per credit hour, so your cost will vary depending upon the number of hours and the type of courses you take. For in-state residents, most courses will cost $215.55 per semester hour, so for six semester hours the approximate cost will be $1293. For out-of-state residents, most courses will cost $721.10 per semester hour, so for six semester hours the approximate cost will be $4,327. You will know your exact cost after you register for your classes. Additional information regarding tuition and fees may be seen here.

There are fees associated with some of my classes and not others. Why is this? Some courses are assessed additional costs for online fees, labs, materials and supplies, and general cost recovery. Most online classes have a distance learning fee per credit hour in addition to regular tuition and fees. This supports the additional staff and technologies required to create and teach the online class. Traditional, face-to-face courses being taught remotely do not have a distance learning fee. For a full list of these courses and costs, download the Additional Cost file here .

Is financial aid available for the Summer? Yes. To receive Financial Aid for the Summer, you must submit the 2019-2020 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and register for at least 6 semester hours of credit.  If you have specific questions, we ask that you reach out to the Office of Financial Aid via email at financialaid@fsu.edu . 

I qualified for a Bright Futures Scholarship from the state of Florida. Can I receive it this Summer? Yes. Both the Academic Scholars and Medallion scholarship will be available to you although the book stipend for the Academic Scholars is only available in the Fall and Spring.

I have a financial aid award for the Summer. How will I get my money and when? Disbursement of summer financial aid to students enrolled in session C will begin on 6/16/2020 for federal grant and loan awards. Bright Futures awards will be disbursed to eligible students at the end of drop add on 6/30/2020 and every week thereafter. Additional information related to financial aid may be viewed on our website. In order to get your money, you must enroll in Direct Deposit. 

When I have finished registering for my classes, when and how do I pay for them? If you receive financial aid like Bright Futures, scholarships or other aid, this will be posted to your account automatically based on the disbursement schedule. You can check your balance in the Campus Solution system and pay your balance. You learn more about this during Orientation.

Housing & Dining 
Will University Housing be available? There will not be University Housing available for the Summer C term. Your first opportunity to live on campus will be in the fall semester. If you havent already done so, complete your fall contract on the housing portal. More information can be found on the University Housing website.

I submitted a contract for on-campus housing for the summer. Will I get a refund? Yes, if you have already contracted for housing for Summer C, your deposit will be credited to your student account.  

I purchased an on-campus dining plan for the summer. Will I get a refund? Meal plan charges will not yet have been posted to your account. You will not be charged for this.

Success in Online Classes 
How do I get started with online learning at FSU? Learning online is a different experience from a traditional, face-to-face classroom. You will need access to technology to connect with your instructor, as well as good organization and time-management skills. The Student Guide to Learning Online provides steps to help you get setup and ready to learn online.

What technology do I need for online classes? You will need a computer with speakers and internet access at a minimum. A web camera, either as part of the computer or as an add-on, may be required for some courses. Access to Canvas, Office 365, and many other programs is available either free or at significantly reduced costs for FSU students. You can learn more about the technical requirements and the essential online tools and applications you need in the Student Guide to Learning Online.

What do I do if I dont have access to a computer or internet? Students experiencing financial hardship related to acquiring the appropriate technology, should contact Case Management Services at casemanagement@fsu.edu . For free and discounted WiFi, check out the ITS Free and Discounted WiFi Options page.

What is the difference between remote and online classes? Classes will be offered online (a course specially designed for online learning) or remote (traditional lecture or discussion-based classes offered through online platforms). You can search for remote offerings in MyFSUsClass Search using the Physical Location field.

Classes will be either synchronous (taught live) or asynchronous (online with no scheduled meeting time). Heres how to tell the difference: 

Classes with specific days/time listed: These are synchronous classes. The class will meet virtually at those times via Zoom or other technologies. The registration system will not allow you to enroll in remote, synchronous classes with overlapping times.

Classes with days/time listed as TBA: These are asynchronous classes. The class will not meet virtually at a specific time and will use other teaching methods like recorded videos so coursework can be done at your convenience.

How can I get help with my classes? FSU has a multitude of resources to help you be successful in your classes, whether online or face-to-face. You will learn about these during Orientation. In the meantime, you might want to look at the websites of the Academic Center for Excellence, FSU Libraries, Reading Writing Center, and the Johnston Digital Studio. There you may schedule online appointments for tutoring or other academic support services for students.

15-Apr-20,"As our highest priority remains the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, Florida State University will continue to deliver classes remotely during Summer Session C, which runs June 22 through July 31, 2020. This extension of online instruction includes the FSU Panama City campus.

Along with classes remaining online through the end of the summer semester, FSU will cancel or postpone all in-person events consisting of 10 people or more to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus. This cancellation of on-campus events includes all summer camps and activities normally held at the university. This policy shall be in effect until Aug. 2, 2020, and will be under continual review.

In addition, University Housing will not be available for the Summer C term for first-time students or those who left campus earlier this spring. If a student has already contracted for housing for Summer C, their deposit will be credited to their student account.

For many students, Summer C will be their first semester in college. While it is disappointing that we cannot offer in-person classes or housing at this time, FSU is diligently working to support all students and ensure they receive a top-notch education.

Knowing that many students will be first-time FSU students, either as freshmen or transfers, we have prepared an extensive list of Frequently Asked Questions to help address questions and concerns. We also will have a similar guide specialized for graduate students and post-docs posted soon on The Graduate Schools webpage at gradschool.fsu.edu. We want to help every FSU student succeed!

Florida State will continue to closely monitor and evaluate information and guidance provided by state and federal agencies. This is an unprecedented situation, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to make decisions that keep our university community safe.

16-Apr-20,"Editors note: Names of the 7,000 graduates will be read aloud by their college in separate videos to be posted at commencement.fsu.edu on May 2. Graduates names will not be read aloud during the virtual ceremony as doing so would extend the program by several hours.

Graduates and families invited to participate remotely while practicing social distancing

Florida State University will stream a virtual commencement ceremony for its spring graduates Saturday, May 2.

President John Thrasher will preside over the ceremony, which will be streamed on the universitys website, Facebook and YouTube channels. The ceremony will begin at 2 p.m. ET.

We were all heartbroken when the coronavirus pandemic forced us to cancel spring commencement at the Tucker Center, Thrasher said. We still want to recognize our students on graduation day and award the academic degrees that they earned through years of study and hard work. Hopefully, this virtual ceremony will give our graduates and their loved ones an opportunity to participate in a meaningful shared experience.

The virtual ceremony will incorporate many of the traditional customs associated with the usual on-campus commencement exercises, such as an opening processional to Pomp and Circumstance, the playing of the National Anthem, the Pledge of Allegiance, the official conferring of graduate and undergraduate academic degrees, and the turning of tassels on the graduates caps.

Thrasher will be joined at the virtual ceremony by a handful of university administrators in full academic regalia. Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Sally McRorie, Dean of Undergraduate Studies Karen Laughlin, Dean of the Graduate School Mark Riley, and Dean of the Jim Moran College of Entrepreneurship Susan Fiorito will participate while observing social distancing guidelines.

Ed Burr, chair of the FSU Board of Trustees, and 2019-2020 Student Body President Evan Steinberg will deliver brief remarks via video.

The virtual ceremony will also include a commencement address by Mark Zeigler, a teaching professor from the FSU School of Communication.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of traditional spring commencement ceremonies scheduled at Florida State and at other institutions across the nation. FSU normally hosts four separate commencement ceremonies at the end of the spring semester to accommodate its graduates and their guests.

Several changes have been made to shorten the ceremony and ensure the health and safety of the participants. No graduates or guests will be present. Graduates and their family members and friends should remain at home and not come to campus.

Graduates names will not be individually announced during the virtual ceremony due to time constraints. Names will briefly appear at the end of the virtual ceremony and can be found in the digital commencement program that will be posted online at commencement.fsu.edu prior to the ceremony.

Florida State will award degrees to 6,973 graduates this semester: 5,628 bachelors degrees, 1,134 masters degrees and 211 doctorates. These totals include graduates at FSU Panama City and the universitys campus in the Republic of Panama. The university will recognize students who have earned academic honors as well as student-veterans and members of the Garnet and Gold Scholar Society.

The College of Medicine, which will graduate 114 new medical doctors, has scheduled a virtual commencement ceremony for 10 a.m. Saturday, May 16. The ceremony will be livestreamed at med.fsu.edu. The College of Law will award 159 juris doctor degrees, 33 juris masters degrees and five LL.M. degrees at a ceremony to be held at a later date.

A campus celebration for the spring 2020 graduates will be held at a future date after public health officials determine it is safe to resume large social gatherings. Plans will be announced well in advance to allow sufficient time to make travel arrangements.

When its safe to do so, we hope our spring graduates will come back to campus so we can celebrate together, Thrasher said. In the meantime, we hope they will participate in this virtual ceremony and share their commencement photos and videos with the university community via social media.

The virtual spring commencement ceremony will be streamed at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 2, via the following websites and social media platforms:

live.wfsu.org 
YouTube.com/floridastate 
Facebook.com/floridastate 

The virtual ceremony will also be telecast in the Tallahassee area at 6:30 p.m. May 2, on Comcast cable channel 4.

It will be archived online for future viewing on-demand at www.learningforlife.fsu.edu/fsu-graduation/

27-Apr-20,"Florida State University is open and operational. The Governors Safer-at-Home order remains in effect and on-campus operations continue to be restricted to essential functions only.

Effective May 1, 2020, employees who are unable to perform their work remotely and have exhausted Emergency Paid Sick Leave and Emergency Family and Medical Leave, if applicable, should begin using their personal leave (annual, sick or compensatory). If personal leave has been exhausted, employees should record leave without pay. In the event that the Governor lifts the current Safer-at-Home order, additional guidance will be issued at that time regarding what operations will be permitted to resume on campus.

The following instructions remain in place for other employees as follows:

On-campus essential employees should continue reporting to work as instructed by their supervisors.
All employees who are able to work remotely should continue to do so. Managers must ensure that employees who are working remotely have sufficient, meaningful work to perform. Managers should work with employees to supplement leave on timesheets if there is not sufficient work available to fulfill the normal work schedule. For guidance on assisting employees with remote work, please visit the Human Resources COVID-19 FAQs question Im not sure what remote work options are available to me. What should I do?.
The University continues to monitor the dynamic COVID-19 situation. As new information becomes available, we are committed to keeping the campus community informed as quickly and accurately as possible. Thank you for your patience, dedication, and adaptability during this time.

30-Apr-20,Florida State University administrators are aware of the plans announced Wednesday by Gov. Ron DeSantis. FSU is evaluating and anticipates providing updated guidance for employees in the next 24 hours.,Florida State University
5-May-20,"On April 29, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order 20-112   and unveiled the first step of a phased approach to re-opening the state. Phase 1 became effective May 4, 2020. If local governments allow, restaurants and retail businesses are allowed to operate at 25% capacity, and hospitals will reinstate elective procedures with the exception of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. Schools will continue with distance learning for the remainder of the school year throughout the state. High-risk individuals are encouraged to continue to shelter in place.

Effective today, employees who would like to return to campus to work or who have been unable to perform their work remotely, may return (based on the availability of work) with supervisory approval. Although on-campus operations remain restricted, departments may allow employees to return to their work location as long as no more than 25% of staff are present at one time. Employees who are able to work remotely may continue to do so. It is still strongly encouraged that employees who do return to campus continue to practice social distancing. Faculty will continue to hold classes online through Summer C. The amount of people present on campus will be restricted to 25% to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Deans, Directors, and Department Heads, in conjunction with managers and supervisors, are responsible for coordinating work schedules and ensuring that no more than 25% of staff are present in each location. We anticipate this status will remain in effect through May 29, 2020. Should more information become available before then, updated guidance will be provided accordingly.

Instructions regarding the resumption of on-campus research activities, to include the limited return of staff beginning on May 6, will be provided by Vice President Ostrander during the 7th Research Continuity Zoom Meeting today at 1:30 p.m.

Exemptions for Returning to Campus
Individuals who have recently traveled outside of the Tallahassee area should not return to campus until they have been COVID-19 symptom free at their normal place of residence for 14 days. Individuals who have experienced COVID-19 symptoms  within the last two weeks should not return to their work location until they have been symptom free for 14 days. Symptoms of COVID-19 include:

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Remote Work Employees
The majority of University business functions will still be performed remotely. Employees are not prohibited from coming to campus and may report to work to perform their job duties with supervisory approval. Employees who are able to perform their duties from a remote location should continue to do so. Since Leon County Schools will remain closed until the end of the school year, employees may continue to care for minor children while working from home. However, minor children are not permitted on campus.

Social Distancing
Employees who report to campus should continue to practice the CDC Guidelines for Social Distancing . Flexible or rotating schedules for on-campus employees are appropriate to reduce the amount of people sharing physical space. Continue to refrain from conducting in-person meetings with groups of people. In accordance with the Governors recommendations, employees are encouraged to wear a cloth face covering  when able, especially in situations where social distancing may be difficult.

High-Risk Employees
Special consideration should be given to employees who are 65 and older, and/or have underlying health issues that may increase the severity of infection should they contract COVID-19. The Governor advised that high-risk individuals stay home if they are able, avoid crowds, and practice social distancing when they have to be out. For high-risk employees that do not want to report to campus and are also unable to perform their duties remotely, we ask that supervisors consider approving sick or annual leave, unless operational functions would be severely impacted. Consult with Human Resources for additional guidance.

Administrative Leave
Employees who have been unable to perform their work remotely can come to campus based on the availability of work. April 30, 2020, was the last day for eligible employees to receive Administrative Leave. These employees must report to campus to perform their job duties or work with their supervisor and Department Head to arrange a flexible schedule.

Building Safety
Due to a reduced number of faculty, staff, and students present, facilities staff who provide the usual cleaning and sanitation services also have a limited presence on campus. As a result, we cannot guarantee that facilities will be maintained on a daily basis in a manner that meets with best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, buildings will remain locked and require card access for entry. Visitors are not permitted while on-campus operations are restricted.

Preparing for Phase 2
An announcement that Florida has advanced to Phase 2 will not automatically trigger a move to Phase 2 by the University. Once Phase 2 is announced, the University will review the plan and continue to assess the COVID-19 situation to determine if further guidance should be issued at that time. We anticipate requiring an in-person presence for all departments beginning in Phase 2. Departments should begin preparing for Phase 2 by developing a plan and schedule for employees to physically return with no more than 50% on campus at any given time.

Departments should develop rotating schedules for staff. Examples include:

Departments may alternate their presence in the department on a daily or half-day basis.
Departments may rotate on-campus presence weekly.
Departments may allow employees to come to their work location as needed to perform their job duties by checking in with the supervisor first to ensure a reduced footprint is maintained.

8-May-20,"Executive Order 20-112   does not mandate the use of masks or cloth face coverings. However, the state has recommended that businesses follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance  to plan, prepare, and respond to COVID-19. Employees who report to campus should continue to practice the CDC Guidelines for Social Distancing . Employees should avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more and refrain from in-person meetings if alternatives for collaboration exist. The use of a face covering is an important preventive measure but is not a substitute for social distancing. In situations where close contact is difficult or unavoidable, such as when moving through shared spaces like hallways and elevators, employees should wear a face covering (cloth or disposable).

Deans, Directors, and Department Heads may mandate the use of face coverings when the nature of the work being performed requires it. If departments do mandate the use of face coverings, they should provide them for the employees who are required to wear them. The Environmental Health & Safety Office has already provided recommended specifications for cloth and disposable face coverings to Procurement to aid in their purchasing.

The CDC requires that cloth face coverings must:
Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Include multiple layers of fabric
Allow for breathing without restriction
Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape
If you are not a healthcare worker, do not request a face mask such as the N95 respirator. N95 respirators require special fit testing and individuals must be screened by a medical professional before use.

Please work with Procurement (procurement@fsu.edu ) on the purchasing of masks, face coverings or other Personal Protective Equipment.

12-May-20,"_More than 12,500 Florida State University students will receive emergency federal funding provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to assist them with unexpected costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law to provide economic relief from COVID-19. It authorized the U.S. Department of Education to provide funding for universities and colleges to award in the form of emergency financial aid grants to eligible students.

FSU received $29.3 million from the CARES Act, of which $14.6 million is designated for emergency grants to students. The university will use the remaining funds to pay for other unexpected expenses due to COVID-19.

To be eligible for FSUÕs first wave of CARES Act funding distribution, students must have been enrolled in the Spring 2020 semester, submitted their federal financial aid application (FAFSA) for the 2019-2020 academic year, and must not have already received emergency relief funding from the university.

 In the first wave, students will receive grants between $400 and $600, totaling $6.24 million. The group includes students who have no expected family contribution, Pell grant recipients, and graduate and professional students with need greater than $1,000.

 FSU confirmed studentsÕ financial need based on their federal financial aid application on file with the university.

Students eligible to receive CARES Act funding were notified by email on May 11 and should receive funding as soon as May 13.  

The university will distribute additional CARES Act awards in the future. More information will be available at https://financialaid.fsu.edu/cares-act as those decisions are finalized.

Hundreds of students already have received financial assistance through FSUÕs Seminole Emergency Funds, which were created to quickly address a variety of needs. To date, 657 students have received an average award of $607.71. For more information on the Seminole Emergency Funds, visit https://foundation.fsu.edu/fnd-emergency.

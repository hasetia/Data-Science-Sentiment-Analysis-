397,Berkeley,18-May-20,"We are writing today to share news about budget-related implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we have shared previously, the loss in current and projected revenues to the campus is significant; combined with actual and projected increased expenses, the total impact will likely be in the range of $210-300 million.

While there has been progress in finding new ways to generate revenue for the campus and our philanthropic gains have been significant, it is clear we will need to take actions within our control to cut expenses in order to reduce the pandemic-related impact to the campus budget. The largest portion of our budget, approximately 68 percent, is personnel costs. Of those costs, the merit increases for non-represented staff and annual cost-of-living increases for represented staff and faculty (range adjustments) account for $50 million annually on our campus alone.

UC President Janet Napolitano will propose to the Board of Regents this week that there be a systemwide freeze on the salaries of non-represented staff and faculty for fiscal year 2021. This does not apply to retention, promotion, and other faculty advancement cases with July 1, 2020 effective dates. This also does not apply to equity increases for staff, but they will be granted on a limited basis and must be approved by the Finance Committee. The process for requesting approval will be released in the coming days. In addition, President Napolitano will propose that she and the 10 campus chancellors each take a 10 percent pay cut. Finally, UCOP is initiating discussions with union leaders to convey the gravity of the system’s financial circumstances. Here is a link to the UCOP announcement and Frequently Asked Questions page.

We realize that this news comes at a time when many of you have health and financial concerns for yourself and your loved ones, are struggling with being separated from friends and family, and are experiencing the fragility and uncertainty that has become all too real during this pandemic. We regret that this announcement will present an additional unwelcome burden.

Please be assured that we will continue to look at all other means of budget relief that do not adversely impact our employees. We are deeply grateful for the many and varied contributions of our UC Berkeley faculty and staff, especially during these very challenging times, and we will continue to support you in any way that we are able.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/18/uc-to-implement-pay-freeze-for-non-represented-staff-and-faculty/
1368,Berkeley,16-May-20,"Members of the remarkable and resilient graduating class of 2020, let me offer you my deepest and most heartfelt congratulations.

While this is a day to celebrate your achievement, let us also take a moment to acknowledge and thank your parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends—everyone who has helped you arrive at one of life’s great milestones.

If you could transport yourself back in time just three months, I do not think you could’ve imagined that you would celebrate this day at home, perhaps in your pajamas instead of a cap and gown, watching boxy avatars float across a computer screen. And I don’t think you could’ve fathomed that your college experience would come to a close without the laughter-filled last meals with friends, the warm embraces and tearful goodbyes, and the exuberant parties that typically mark the end of the school year.

Graduation 2020
Meet the top graduate, and more

But graduating in 2020 is anything but typical. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, we face both the dangers wrought by the virus as well as the massive societal and economic upheaval that is accompanying its spread. These are sobering reminders that we are not the sole authors of the stories of our lives. We share that credit with a capricious collaborator called circumstance.

In the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, the protagonist, Frodo, laments that a great evil has come to Middle Earth and wrenched him away from his tranquil existence. “I wish it need not have happened in my time,” he sighs.

His friend and mentor, the wizard Gandalf, responds with tenderness and wisdom: “So do I, and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”

“
The pandemic and its effects have been thrust upon us all, and the only thing in our power is how we choose to respond.”

– – Chancellor Carol Christ

This, of course, is the test that lies before you, your peers, your loved ones, even me: The pandemic and its effects have been thrust upon us all, and the only thing in our power is how we choose to respond. We can let these weighty circumstances hold us down, or we can decide to pick ourselves back up, to adapt, to push onward. Trials such as this are opportunities to cultivate habits of mind that will serve us for all time: courage, ingenuity, resilience, patience, humility, grace, and gratitude.

Already, these traits have been on full display as your class has navigated the monumental transformations of the last several weeks. Some of you kept up your studies even as you took on the role of full-time teacher to younger siblings, as you cared for elder relatives, as you struggled through the suddenly dire challenges of a poor internet connection, or as you woke at 5 a.m. for class in a different time zone. Given the circumstances, your efforts to reach this day are nothing short of heroic. The Class of 2020 will go down in the history books as one that achieved greatness in the face of unprecedented turmoil.

This very celebration, the Blockeley commencement, is a testament to how you have sought out light within darkness. When our campus decided to postpone an in-person spring commencement ceremony, Bjorn Lustic – on a break from his studies at Cal – saw a social media post jokingly asking for someone to build a campus in Minecraft so that students could receive their diplomas digitally.

Well, he thought … why not try? Recruiting a friend and their siblings, Bjorn got to work on the re-creation of California Memorial Stadium that we’re standing in today. As the group shared their progress, excitement grew, and soon hundreds of Berkeley students and alumni were working hand-in-virtual-hand to construct the entire campus from the ground up.

Ultimately, they created something exquisite, detailed, and beautiful. More than that, though, they gave Cal students who had been scattered across the globe a way to vividly experience Berkeley. They offered these students a chance to reconnect with the places they cherished: the magnificent beaux arts buildings like Doe Library and Wheeler Hall, the bustling student union, shaded bridges across Strawberry Creek, a sunlit memorial glade, the stately campanile towering over it all.


A message to the class of 2020 from Chancellor Carol Christ. (UC Berkeley video by Stephen McNally)
In his book In Search of Lost Time, the author Marcel Proust finds that memories are often triggered by our senses, by what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. A bite of a madeleine cookie brings rushing back to Proust childhood trips to see his aunt, who would give him a piece of her own madeleine on Sunday mornings before Mass. Other experiences are reawakened within him when he sees steeples on the rural horizon, or feels uneven paving stones beneath his feet.

Returning to campus – whether virtually today, or in person at a later date – stirs up these kinds of memories within each of us. Walking around Berkeley, or Blockeley, you encounter the backdrop of your college career. The episodes that spring to mind are both shared and deeply personal, for each of us fills in the details, and colors in the figures, according to our own experience. As you pass Moffitt, you may recollect certain moments with friends as you studied late into the evening, or walking by Haas Pavilion, remember the roar of the crowd as you cheered for the Golden Bears in a game against Stanford. Perhaps you’ll recall the way a partner smiled on a first date in a Bancroft cafe; or think back to the crunch of your own footsteps on a quiet walk through Tilden Park on a moonlit evening.

“
This very celebration, the Blockeley commencement, is a testament to how you have sought out light within darkness.

– – Chancellor Carol Christ

For the poet William Wordsworth, memories like these are powerful sources of pleasure that can carry a person through the most troubled of times. His poem “Tintern Abbey”, describing a visit to a countryside on the banks of the River Wye after many years away, is in some ways a somber reflection on the loss of youth and the passage of time. Yet he finds that memories of his life are also emotional bastions, the bearers of “tranquil restoration” in moments of turmoil. He claims: “I have owed to them, / In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, / Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart.”

Though your college career is reaching its end, I hope you will carry Berkeley with you – in the connections you’ve made, in the lessons you’ve learned, in the memories you feel in the blood and along the heart. I hope that this institution can remain a source of peace, calm, and hope for you in troubled times – and a place to which you will return often, both in person and in your mind’s eye.

Members of the class of 2020, as you enter a society that is facing unprecedented tumult, these places of solace will have even more meaning for you. Find in them the strength that will allow you to face a world that has been torn apart, and to re-envision and reshape it into one that is more just and more beautiful.

May the education you have received at Berkeley serve not just your lives but your society well. May your years ahead be richly rewarding and fulfilling, and may you enjoy much happiness. We are immensely proud of what you have done, and even more, of who you will become.

Spring commencement is one of UC Berkeley’s happiest events. But this year, along came COVID-19. Campus buildings emptied, lights went off, doors locked and students, staff and faculty disappeared. So did hopes for the massive Saturday, May 16 ceremony in California Memorial Stadium, and the rest of this month’s graduation festivities.

But Berkeley’s newest graduates will hardly be forgotten. Starting this Friday night, lights will be turned on — blue and gold ones, shining from campus landmarks — for sheltered-in-place students to see on social media. On Saturday, Chancellor Carol Christ will email video congratulations to all grads. And any well-wisher can visit a special website that day to post photo, video and written tributes to the Class of 2020.

The graduates’ most amazing gift, however, will be from a team of more than 100 of their peers. At 2 p.m. on Saturday, they can attend a virtual, mock commencement ceremony in the stadium — complete with “Pomp and Circumstance,” the chancellor, the conferring of degrees, “Hail to California” and flying mortarboards. It will happen within Blockeley University, a fantastical recreation of the campus built by Berkeley students and alumni using Minecraft, a video game many of them first played as tweens.

A two-day Blockeley Music Festival will follow, starting at 4 p.m. on Saturday, with 40 artists performing on a Blockeley University stage. Donations to the event will go to Off Their Plate, a COVID-19-related grassroots effort that’s reviving restaurant jobs while providing meals to health care workers.

All the festivities will be livestreamed on Twitch. Those with Minecraft accounts can join in-game from anywhere in the world by entering a Blockeley server ip address in the Minecraft multiplayer tab. They’ll be able to move about, even fly, through campus, where more than 100 buildings have been painstakingly reinvented, as have tiny details, from the Campanile’s falcon chicks to Kiwibots to boba shops to campus banners for the current “150 Years of Women at Berkeley” observance.

“Our priority, for the graduating class this year, was to provide a sense of closure, especially now that we’re in such a weird time that brought an abrupt end to senior year,” said Bjorn Lustic, who invented Blockeley University after seeing a March 15 Facebook post suggesting a virtual graduation in Memorial Stadium built on a Minecraft platform.

“For me,” added Nick Pickett, a graduating senior on the Blockeley University team, “working on this has definitely been a coping mechanism (during the pandemic), a way for me to express my love for Cal and to celebrate my graduation, my four years here.”

At the simulated event, Christ and Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher will appear in-game to give speeches, along with speakers Lustic and fellow builder Nga Nguyen; Lydia Winters, head of brand vision and strategy for the global Minecraft franchise; Justin Kan, co-founder of live video platforms Justin.tv and Twitch; and Min-Liang-Tan, co-founder of gaming hardware company Razer Inc.

“If you had asked me a month ago what Minecraft was, … I would’ve told you it was the art of working in a mine,” said Christ. “Now that our students have constructed the incredible Blockeley campus, I know better! It will be an honor to participate in the once-in-a-lifetime ceremony on Saturday.”

Fisher quipped that, the first time he saw his avatar, he thought it bore “an uncanny resemblance” to himself. He said he’s impressed at how the student team has built in six weeks a campus that was “slowly pieced together over the course of about 150 years.”

“When I heard they pulled data from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to generate the terrain with pinpoint accuracy,” he added, “I thought, ‘I might need to see if our campus architect is hiring.’”

Students revive favorite middle school game
Many of Blockeley University’s student builders are old pros at Minecraft, a so-called “sandbox game” that lets players control their own fun, or objectives. A cognitive science major on leave from Berkeley this semester, Lustic first played in 2010, as a Marin County 8th grader.

“It’s a freeing thing, and unique,” he says of Minecraft, admitting it became such a creative and social outlet for him in high school that his parents would yell, “Why are you staying up so late? You have school tomorrow!” “Yeah,” he said, “it was an obsession.”

He didn’t have time for Minecraft at Berkeley, with his studies and Cal Men’s Crew schedule. But when COVID-19 hit, courses went online and in-person graduation ceremonies were dropped, Lustic said he decided to build Memorial Stadium with friend Hunter Hall, a current Berkeley student, just to produce “a little ceremony, maybe having Minecraft avatars walking across (a stage).”

In no time, their siblings and about a dozen others had joined in. The stadium was built in three days, said Lustic, “and then I-House, then the law school, then the Campanile, and then all these buildings were popping up, and we thought maybe doing the campus was feasible.”

Pickett, from San Diego, started playing Minecraft at 13 — “I grew up on Legos, and this is like Legos, but infinite,” he said — but stopped after 10th grade. In college, as a tuba player in the Cal Band, he said his band member roommates threw the occasional Minecraft party, but that he didn’t return to the game until he saw photos posted of what Lustic and the earliest crew members were building.

“About a week after they finished Memorial Stadium,” he said, “I saw a photo of North Tunnel, …which is an emotional place, a second home for us (in the Cal Band)” while waiting to rush onto the football field. He said the tunnel built in Minecraft looked “very off, and I was kind of distraught. …I joined the builders’ group then and there.”

Two weeks later, “we knew we wouldn’t finish the entire campus on time,” said Pickett. A call was put out for more builders, “and I started a Discord (group-chatting platform) to coordinate and organize everyone into a more complex structure,” said Pickett, who was put in charge of making sure various buildings got done on schedule.

Today’s massive team of Blockeley University builders “is a ball screaming down a hill at a little over 100 (people),” he said.

Most of them are STEM majors — the group took a poll – and only a handful are women, like freshman Nga Nguyen, a Minecraft player since she was 12. “It’s 100% still a thing with my peers,” she said. “It’s a great way to spend time with friends, while simultaneously relieving the stress of impending adulthood.”

Nguyen, a chemical biology major from Southern California, said she’s built or helped construct Dwinelle, Sproul, Bowles, Lewis and Mulford halls, the stadium, International House, Maxwell Family Field, the law and business schools, Foothill residence hall, the Genetic and Plant Biology building and Doe Library.

She’ll also be a guest speaker at the virtual ceremony, proud to be one of the few women builders of Blockeley University and to have accomplished this at Berkeley as it celebrates the outstanding women in its 150-year history.

Elliot Choi, a senior majoring in economics and data science who oversees many of Blockeley University’s different project teams, was introduced to Minecraft about 10 years ago by a cousin. At the time, an account cost about $12, compared to around $27 today.

(Photo by Carmen Adams)

“My dad is a software engineer; he helped my friends and me set up our own Minecraft server, which regularly had 60 to 70 players, which was pretty high for back then,” said Choi, who is from West Hills, California. “I also was able to set up a donation system to keep upgrading the server. I made about $1,200 in my second year of running it.”

In high school, he said, “I don’t think it was as much of a craze as it is right now, and most people weren’t very open about playing it.”

When he saw a Facebook post about a Minecraft commencement at Berkeley, “I thought it was a joke and forgot about it for a week,” he said. “Then Bjorn and Hunter’s mutual friend added me to a group chat with Bjorn. I joined Bjorn’s server and did most of the bleachers and walls of Memorial Stadium … and the shell of I-House, because I spent a lot of time in the dining hall there.” Choi coined the word “Blockeley” in mid-March and helped transfer the burgeoning files from Lustic’s server to a more stable web hosting service.

President of Golden Records, an electronic music industry club at Berkeley, Choi also thought up this weekend’s Minecraft music festival. He reached out to alumnus Johan Yang, of Beauz, a DJ/music producer duo, “and from there it really took off. We started getting interest from A-list artists around the world, and currently, we’ve reached a point where we’ve had to make a waitlist.”

Virtual, but heartfelt, tributes across campus
Berkeley’s graduates are spending a lot of time online this month, not only wrapping up remaining coursework, but checking out video tributes and participating in Zoom events created for them by their academic schools, units, departments and organizations as they shelter at home.

The College of Environmental Design (CED), for example, will launch on May 17 a virtual yearbook where its grads can create a personal profile they can share, and that alumni can see, for recruiting efforts. It also will include speeches, student essays and CED’s annual CIRCUS showcase of exemplary student work. A printable version will be designed by Berkeley landscape architecture professor Richard Hindle.

A virtual celebration for engineering graduates and their families and friends is on May 19. The self-guided event will include recorded video remarks from the College of Engineering’s dean and department chairs, as well as personalized slides for each graduate.

This Saturday, Cal Athletics will stream the “Cal Athletics Senior Celebration: A Recognition of Student-Athlete Success,” with guest speakers Christ, Director of Athletics Jim Knowlton, Rugby Head Coach Jack Clark and rugby student-athlete Robert Paylor, a graduating senior who suffered a spinal cord injury at a game in 2017 and is one of five recipients of the 2020 National Association of Academic and Student-Athlete Development Professionals’ Wilma Rudolph Student-Athlete Achievement Award.

A tradition at Cal Performances’ end-of-school-year celebration for its student workers will continue this Sunday. Each year, graduates on the 40-member Front of House team — students who take tickets and help guests at events — receive leis made of performance-related items, like tickets, caution tape, program notes, ear plugs, glow sticks and headliners’ photos.

This year, the leis are being delivered to grads, so they can wear them at the event, to be held virtually, and 2020 pandemic-era supplies — hand sanitizer and a mask — were woven in.

Right now, staying close and connected to others is tough, but Berkeley’s graduation events all contain a healthy dose of heart, in hopes of keeping and deepening graduates’ ties to the campus and each other while sheltered at home, no matter where they are worldwide.

Even at quirky, yet ethereal Blockeley University, it’s impossible not to be pulled into the emotionality of the landscapes. Students have dreamed them up, depicting what they love about Berkeley and its landmarks — on blue sky mornings, at fiery sunsets, on starry nights and even in the Bay Area’s thick fog — and the little things, like a llama on Memorial Glade, where students occasionally are treated to visits from therapy llamas, to fight academic stress before finals.

Lustic, who took this semester off, feeling lost, said the project, which grew beyond anything he’d imagined and introduced him — albeit virtually — to dozens of new students and alumni, helped him “finally understand that Berkeley has so much to offer.”

“Forming this Blockeley community really invigorated me and showed me the minds of my peers at Cal,” he said. “I don’t know where else you meet these kinds of kids. It makes me want to come back, for sure.”",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/14/unforgotten-covid-19-era-grads-to-be-celebrated-virtually-this-saturday/
887,Berkeley,12-May-20,"Last Tuesday, our campus participated in #GivingTuesdayNow, a global day of giving that was launched to help support those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We write today to offer an update on the success of that drive, to share other campus efforts to support vulnerable members of our community, and to encourage students in need to apply for aid if you have not already done so. Please visit the COVID-19 emergency relief fund portal to identify and apply for all of the funding for which you may be eligible.

Student Emergency Fund

As we reported last week, Kathy Kwan – a generous UC Berkeley alumna – kicked off our #GivingTuesdayNow drive by committing $1 million to emergency financial support for Berkeley students. She also challenged other alumni, parents, donors, and community members to build upon her generosity by raising an additional $1 million for the Student Emergency Fund.

Since Tuesday, we have heard from many donors inspired by Kathy’s challenge, and we are pleased to announce that more than 2,000 individuals have stepped up to support the fund, which offers direct financial support to Berkeley undergraduate and graduate students experiencing unforeseen difficulties and who are disparately impacted during this time. Our fundraising efforts will continue as we continue our work to meet Kathy’s challenge.

Through our Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, we have awarded undergraduate and graduate students $547,000 in Financial Aid and Scholarships and emergency funding since the crisis began, as well as an additional $120,000 in emergency grants for graduate students from the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant.

Basic Needs Fund

Our community has also come together to support our Bear Pantry and Diaper Bank, located in our student family housing facilities, with $80,000 in donations from the Graduate Assembly and $5,000 from the philanthropic Section Club. Additionally, the campus has supported the Bear Pantry and Diaper Bank with $10,000 as well as food donations. Finally, the Offices of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and the Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion led an effort with Cabinet colleagues in repurposing a total of $63,750 to the Basic Needs Fund, recognizing that staff are among those disparately impacted and suffering multiple challenges right now.

Support for International Students

While not eligible for significant federal and state aid, we know that our international students are nonetheless going through a very challenging period. These students are vital to the vibrancy of our community, and the Berkeley International Office is currently reviewing over 200 applications from international students for emergency student aid. The office will aim to distribute campus funds to international students in the next several weeks.

Support for Graduate Students

Through our Graduate Division, we increased summer funding for graduate students by $600,000. This block grant funding was given to departments to allocate to students. Additionally, the Graduate Division allocated an additional $200,000 in funding to support COVID-19-related basic needs relief, including for graduate student parents. They also increased the number of subsidized back-up care hours that student parents can use for the rest of the school year.

Technology Assistance

The Student Technology Fund (STF) created an emergency response Technology Access Program that, with the support of $280,000 in students’ Student Technology Fees, enabled it to distribute 470 laptops and 200 mobile Wi-Fi hotspots with paid unlimited data plans for six months. STF is funding this program’s expansion in the 2020-21 academic year with an additional $490,000, and has granted $100,000 to Moffitt Library’s electronic lending program, and $228,000 to secure ZoomPro accounts and ZoomPro IT support for all students. STF and others have also supported the launch of the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund portal.

Federal CARES Act Funding for Students

Finally, as mentioned in previous messages, the campus secured $15.2 million in direct-to-student aid through the CARES Act (the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security federal relief bill). These cash grants will help undergraduate and graduate students pay for course materials, technology, food, housing, healthcare and child care expenses they incur as a result of social distancing and remote instruction. The campus has awarded $9.6 million of the $11.2 million set aside for eligible undergraduates. The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, the Graduate Division, and the Graduate Assembly are working closely on awarding CARES Act funding to graduate students and anticipate that $4 million in awards will be distributed to graduate students beginning at the end of May.  Although undocumented students are not eligible to receive CARES Act funding, UC Berkeley is committed to providing equivalent awards to undocumented students who qualify for in-state tuition under AB540. We have awarded over $327,000 in CARES-equivalent funding to undergraduates who filed a California Dream Act Application.

Commitment to our Community

As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout, UC Berkeley leadership remains committed to supporting the members of our community in any way we can. We are thrilled by the ways in which our alumni and donors have heeded this call, too, and thank them for their generosity. We look forward to working with all of our students, staff and faculty to better understand your needs, support you through this challenging period, and ultimately emerge stronger on the other side.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/12/how-uc-berkeley-is-supporting-students-and-staff-through-covid-19/
354,Berkeley,12-May-20,"There are two major budget concerns Chancellor Carol Christ has for UC Berkeley. One, the short-term loss of revenue caused by empty residence halls, canceled performance events and empty athletic fields.

Two, is the anticipated steep, long-term cut in state support as California, and the world, grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both, Christ said in a live online Campus Conversation on Monday, contribute to a Berkeley budget deficit between $170 and $400 million. The conversation was a chance for Christ to take virtual questions from the campus community, including students, staff and faculty.

Christ, who joined via webcam from her California Hall office, said that she and other campus leaders were working to understand the total budget impact for the campus before making any decisions.

Campus leaders, she said, are guided by three principles, including protecting the health of Berkeleyans, maintaining educational consistency and “saving as many jobs as possible.”

The short-term loss in revenue due to shelter-in-place is best described as a “steep-V,” Christ said, with revenue that will likely start up again as soon as athletics events start, residence halls fill with students or performances resume.

More troublesome are the potential cuts to the state budget, which are predicted to be as much as $53.4 billion over the next two years.

“It is not conceivable for the state to experience that kind of shortfall and for the University of California to not be affected,” Christ said. “That is something we are obviously very, very concerned about.”

Christ added that she and other Berkeley leaders are monitoring the number of students who plan to enroll in the fall, which will have additional impacts on Berkeley’s budget.

Christ also pointed to three scenarios campus leaders are using to prepare for the next few months.

Above all, Christ said she had been pleased by how the campus community has responded to the COVID-19 crisis.

“I have been so impressed by the resiliency and creativity and dedication of the community, particularly at a time when are all facing challenges, not just in our work lives but in our personal lives,” she said.

",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/12/in-online-conversation-carol-christ-gives-budget-campus-updates/
680,Berkeley,6-May-20,"We are writing today to provide an update on our ongoing planning for fall semester operations. The planning process is wide-ranging and is deepening every day as we bring more faculty and staff onto the committees (described below) that are helping us envision what the fall term could look like. We aim to make key decisions in regard to fall operations by mid-June.

Guiding Principle
A single principle guides all of this work: to protect the health of our community. There are additional sets of principles that guide our plans for instruction and research. We are committed to upholding Berkeley’s excellence across all of our mission areas.

Scenario Planning
Because we don’t know what the spread of COVID-19 will look like over the course of the next few months, each committee below has been asked to develop plans for each of the following three scenarios for the fall semester:

Scenario #1: For public health reasons, the campus must continue with full remote instruction, and predominantly remote work being done in the operations and research realms.
Scenario #2: In-person operations resume, with limits and restrictions imposed by public health authorities.
Scenario #3: Campus operations largely return to normal (i.e., mostly in-person), but wherever possible, will accommodate students, staff, researchers and instructors who need or prefer to operate remotely due to continuing pandemic conditions.
Committees
Each of the following committees has been charged with studying and making suggestions for a key area of campus operations. Each committee will be led by members of the Chancellor’s Cabinet and special advisors who will share their committees’ progress and recommendations during weekly Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet will use the recommendations to guide decision-making as we develop plans to resume operations in a way that maximizes community safety. In addition, we will look for opportunities to incorporate the broad range of student perspectives.

The current committees are:

COVID-19 Public Health and Testing Advisory Committee. Led by Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public Health.
Research. Led by Vice Chancellor for Research Randy Katz.
Instruction. Led by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos.
Student Engagement and Services. Co-led by Vice Provost for Graduate Studies Lisa Garcia Bedolla, Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Oscar Dubón, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Cathy Koshland, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
Housing and Dining. Led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
Operations. Led by Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher. There are three subcommittees within the Operations working group: Workforce, led by Vice Provost for the Faculty Benjamin Hermalin and Chief People and Culture Officer Eugene Whitlock; Events and External Relations; and Information Technology, led by Jenn Stringer.
Athletics. Led by Director of Athletics James Knowlton.
Financial Planning. Led by Vice Chancellor for Finance Rosemarie Rae.
Communications. Led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Diana Harvey.
Again, all of this planning is being done with public health guidelines as our backdrop. We will proceed only with the guidance and express approval of local public health authorities.

We will continue to provide regular status reports about this critical planning process on the campus COVID-19 website, under the Return to Campus tab. In addition, our next Campus Conversations event on Monday, May 11 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we invite you to submit questions about the plans and structures we have established here. We’ll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday’s webcast.

Thank you for everything you are doing to support the university’s mission and serve our students. It is indeed a challenging and uncertain time, and we have been so grateful for your commitment, as well as your patience and flexibility. What makes Berkeley Berkeley is not just our physical campus, or our history, or our traditions … above all else, it is our community. No matter what our fall semester looks like, we will remain strong because of the dedicated service of so many of you.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/06/an-update-on-uc-berkeleys-plans-for-the-fall-semester/
605,Berkeley,6-May-20,"We understand that many faculty, staff, and students have questions regarding University-related travel, particularly in view of the COVID-19 situation during summer and fall 2020. We also acknowledge the desire to make international travel plans in the near future and the significant difficulty imposed by this uncertain period. This message includes the most updated information available pertaining to the campus’ travel protocol, travel insurance, travel reimbursement, and international agreements.

UCOP Directives and Campus Travel Protocol 
According to the directives issued by UCOP, all UC community members should temporarily avoid non-essential travel to countries with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice and greater. In addition to the UCOP directive, and local to the UC Berkeley campus, University travel to U.S. State Department ‘Do Not Travel’ level 4 locations requires a two-step approval process, first at the decanal level and then from the Vice Provost for Academic Planning. For details related to how essential travel is defined, and to learn about the approval process, please refer to the Global Engagement Office.

Travel Insurance 
As a reminder, faculty, students, and staff who do not book their travel using Connexxus are encouraged to register all travel whether funded by UC Berkeley or another entity. Travel booked through Connexxus is automatically registered with the UC Travel Insurance program. Registering has many benefits, including travel advisories for the locations that you travel to/through, and the ability for the UC to rapidly assist you in case of emerging incidents, medical emergencies, etc. For those intending to travel using UC Berkeley resources or for campus-approved research or educational purposes, please review the campus’ travel protocol and seek essential travel approval beforehand.

Please keep in mind that travel insurance does not cover foreseeable risk; therefore, any travel to areas with a U.S. State Department ‘Do Not Travel’ level 4 advisory will invalidate travel insurance benefits. UC personnel traveling to regions against this advisory do so potentially at their own physical and financial risk. For more information about travel insurance, please visit Risk Services.

Travel Reimbursement
If your business travel has been canceled as a result of COVID-19 and you were not able to obtain a full refund of some or all of your expenses, you have options for requesting reimbursement, which can vary depending on how you booked your travel. These options are outlined on the travel website as well as on a recorded webinar from April 21st provided by UC Berkeley Travel. A wide range of issues associated with travel impacted by COVID-19 are addressed, including an extended question and answer session.

International Contracts
International agreements committing members of the UC community to travel, or foreign cohorts to visit campus, should include terms that allow for no penalty cancellation of in-person deliverables. Depending on the specific language, force majeure clauses may not cover epidemics (e.g. COVID-19), especially where the cancellation or non-performance due to the incident was foreseeable or predictable at the time of contract execution. Senior administration is coordinating with Business Contracts and Brand Protection (BCBP) and Risk Services to revise the language in international agreements to allow for remote alternatives in lieu of in- or outbound travel, or cancellation without penalty.

For further questions or concerns related to any topic in this message, please contact geo@berkeley.edu.

We thank you for your resilience amidst this crisis. We are committed to providing our entire campus community with the best experience possible. As such, we will continue to inform you of the latest developments regarding travel and COVID-19’s impact on international activity.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/06/coronavirus-response-international-travel-information/
394,Berkeley,4-May-20,"Tomorrow is #GivingTuesdayNow, a new global day of giving in response to the unprecedented needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As you know, many of our students are facing significant financial challenges: almost overnight, part-time jobs that many relied on to fund their education dried up, while layoffs and pay reductions began weakening the capacity of families to provide a foundation of support. For many UC Berkeley students, the disruptions in learning, housing and access to basic necessities were felt immediately and keenly, as described in this story, “The Student Emergency Fund: A Bridge to a Brighter Future.”

In addition, members of our staff are facing similar financial challenges. On top of the financial challenges are the very real health threats presented by COVID-19, which directly affect members of our community and their families.

The campus has responded by raising support for the Student Emergency Fund, which provides financial assistance to students. In response, our supporters have been incredibly generous – more than 800 of them have given to the fund. Many of you have asked us how you can help UC Berkeley students during these challenging times. If you have the means and the desire, please consider donating to the fund.

A generous UC Berkeley alumna has committed $1 million for student emergency needs. She has challenged us to build upon her generosity by also making a gift. We’re aiming to raise $1 million for the Student Emergency Fund to meet that challenge. Funds will be used to provide emergency grants to students needing assistance with food and rent, technology required for the shift to remote learning, and relocation costs.

Staff members are eligible for assistance through the Basic Needs Relief Fund. This fund is also to those students for whom some of the traditional financial aid sources are not available (e.g., graduate students, international students, undocumented students).

Thank you for your continued commitment to UC Berkeley. Thank you for your grace in adjusting your professional lives to meet the needs of our campus community while we deal with this pandemic. And finally, thank you for considering this request to support our neediest students and staff members.

We extend our best wishes for your health and wellness during these difficult times.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/04/how-to-support-uc-berkeley-students-and-staff-on-giving-tuesday/
247,Berkeley,29-April-20,"The Bay Area’s shelter-in-place order has been officially extended through May with only limited easing of restrictions, including construction and certain outdoor activities.

For the UC Berkeley campus, this means our largely remote operations will continue through May, and some construction projects will likely resume. We will be reviewing the new order over the next few days to determine whether there will be any additional changes to current operations.

The City of Berkeley health officer, along with those from six Bay Area Counties, released the details of the new order today. It goes into effect May 4 and will replace the current shelter-in-place order that expires May 3. 

In accordance with the extended shelter in place timeline, the campus will be cancelling campus events that were scheduled to take place May 4 – May 31.

In issuing the new order, the public health officials noted that it is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activities while also preventing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the counties. The new order allows for certain outdoor activities and businesses including landscaping/gardening businesses, summer camps for limited numbers of children with parents in specific workforces, etc.

I want to thank you for continuing to do your part to protect our community and to keep yourself safe. Please continue to visit the campus’s COVID-19 website for the latest informatIon and updates.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/29/shelter-in-place-order-extended-through-may-31/
218,Berkeley,23-April-20,"In response to concerns about proctoring of examinations under shelter-in-place orders and academic misconduct, the Provost convened a working group at the beginning of April. The 21 members of the working group, consisting of faculty and staff from a wide range of disciplines, were charged with examining strategies for remote exams, developing principles for procuring remote proctoring services, and assessing products for our campus.

The working group completed their report on Monday: Guidance and Recommendations for Instructors and Students on Proctoring and Final Examinations. These guidelines and recommendations are posted on the Academic Senate website as well as the Instructional Resilience website. The report complements the existing guidance on Best Practices for Remote Exams.

We strongly encourage instructors and students to read the report, and hope that these guidelines and recommendations will help you prepare for a successful final examination period and the end of the academic year.

Our thanks to the members of the working group for the thoughtful and diligent work that they performed on a very tight schedule. Their efforts are another example of the many that we have witnessed in the past few months of the community coming together to help our campus.

863,Berkeley,23-April-20,"We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 semester. We wish to share information with you as proactively as possible while we carefully observe the progress of the current pandemic.



Like universities around the world, we are working towards making critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation. We have an FAQ website that we will update as more details are announced.

In-person vs. remote instruction decisions
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we don’t have an estimated date. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instructio n. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.

Given the uncertainty the world faces, some students may not be able to safely travel to campus. We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as an option for Fall 2020, even if classes are held in-person.

We’re making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe publ ic health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing. Decisions about broadly offering Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation may be like in the fall.

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising.

Some campus-based fees were established to support certain efforts like the Wellness Fee which is paying for many essential health services. Others were established to maintain the safety of buildings or other facilities when necessary for the health and safety of students—e.g., to address seismic deficiencies. Even as UC campuses such as ours have curtailed limited aspects of their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.

Student housing for fall 2020
Under normal operations, all new students receive priority for housing. It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will allow for normal operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we cannot guarantee housing priority at this time but we are committed to supporting students if they want to liv e on or near campus.

For returning students, if fall classes are offered via remote instruction, we want to empower you to make the best decision for you and your family. We will keep the residential halls and apartments open as they are the primary residence for many students, unless we are required by public health authorities to close them. To date, we have not received any such closure order. If you do choose to live in University owned or affiliated housing, we will allow students the opportunity to be relieved of the financial obligations of their housing and applicable dining contracts and receive a prorated refund if the campus doesn’t resume in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year or ends in-person instruction for an extended period of time (for example, in-person instruction is cancelled for more than 30 consecutive instructional days).

For off-campus housing, students should pay close attention to the terms o f their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease. This will give you more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Learn more about leases at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/leases.

We thank you for your understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the coming fall.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/23/information-about-fall-semester-2020/
747,Berkeley,21-April-20,"You may recall that the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention recently recommended that everyone wear face coverings when away from home to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Please be aware that this is now mandatory in the City of Berkeley, including our campus.

Late last week the City of Berkeley’s Health Officer issued an order requiring that essential businesses such as the campus require their employees to wear a face covering at work, subject to specific exceptions.  We are now requiring that our faculty and staff who are on campus wear face coverings.

UC Berkeley is providing each employee who works on the campus with a face covering or mask. Unless an employee already has  face coverings or masks or has been directed by their supervisor to use their own department’s supply or another supply of masks, Environment, Health & Safety officials will offer masks from a limited stock of surgical masks readily on hand.  The campus will move to providing cloth face coverings when the cloth face coverings purchased arrive later this month.

The surgical masks will be distributed to essential employees at the Hazardous Materials Facility (HMF), 1 Frank Schlessinger Way (enter from Oxford Street; facility is on the right) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, 4/24, Friday, 4/24, and Monday, 4/27.

Faculty or staff picking up masks will be asked to show a Cal ID. If you are not designated as an essential employee or do not have an urgent need to be on campus, please do not come to campus to get a mask.

Face coverings are required for those who work in shared spaces and those performing work in which they encounter the general public. The face coverings must also be worn in common areas indoors, such as hallways and stairwells.  You are not required to wear a face covering when you are the sole occupant of a room, such as your office.

If you have a medical or disability-related reason why it is not appropriate for you to wear a face covering, contact your supervisor to document your situation and obtain an exemption from the requirement.

Also, please be aware that if you provide service to students or the general public, you are required as part of your employment (and consistent with the requirements of the order) to refuse service to individuals who are not wearing face coverings. Such individuals are also to be denied entry to campus facilities.

Keep in mind that a face covering is not a replacement for vigilant physical distancing.

Continue to maintain at least six feet of distance between you and others.

Wearing a cloth face covering is meant to protect others, not the wearer of the covering. Recent studies have suggested that it’s possible to transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. Wearing a cloth face covering decreases the chances of unknowingly transmitting the virus to others.

Employees who are normally required to wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment as part of their job are still required to do so, and will be provided with the required equipment.

We also want to inform you that UHS is now performing COVID-19 tests for all symptomatic faculty and staff. Employees interested in testing at UHS should:

If mild symptoms: call the UCB Occupational Health COVID hotline 510-332-7192 for assessment and instructions (10am-4pm 7 days/week; messages can be left any time).

If ill: please call your own health care provider first for advice or go directly to the nearest Emergency Room.  You are welcome to call Occupational Health as above for testing if advised by your provider.

UHS is also encouraging those who are awaiting test results and those who already have tested positive for COVID-19 via another testing center to call UHS’s CONFIDENTIAL COVID line at (510) 643-8227 to inform clinical leadership.  Officials there want to offer support and services to help those through their care and recovery, and raise our awareness of the number of positive cases in the campus community. This will help UHS plan its services and guide campus decisions.  Your private information will not be shared beyond that required for public health reporting.

Climate Change and COVID-19: Can this crisis shift the paradigm?

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is skidding into recession. Reduced consumption and transportation also mean reduced CO2 emissions. From India to China to the United States, skies are blue and the air is cleaner and healthier in cities than it has been for years. The pandemic has caused seismic shifts in how we produce and consume goods and could open a path to a more sustainable future. Or, government bailouts and investments could double down on the fossil fuel economy, and set back efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change. This conversation will feature Berkeley researchers discussing the science and policy behind CO2 emissions and opportunities for a different path forward.

954,Berkeley,17-April-20,"We wrote to you earlier this month to describe our campus budget picture and the principles we are using to make decisions. Today, we share an update, as well as additional information that we are using to further understand and shape the campus budget for the remainder of this fiscal year, for FY 2021, and beyond.

Before we delve into the details, we want to express our deep appreciation for all that you are doing to preserve our education and research missions, and fulfill our public service mission. We are heartened by the ways so many of you have stepped up to deliver education in a radically different fashion than you are used to; pivoted in creative ways to maintain your research projects, some even venturing into new avenues of research around COVID-19; supported our students in innumerable ways; and served the campus by participating in the new Berkeley Conversations series, holding your own webinars, responding to media inquiries and providing your expertise to our elected officials.

Campus priorities and decision-making principles
As we wrote in our April 1 message, our goals — as far as our budget and community are concerned — are to preserve jobs, and position the campus favorably for the future. Our decisions will continue to be based on public health guidance and our interest in protecting the health and safety of our campus community.

As we move into the budget process, we will prioritize protecting the academic core while also providing resources to departments entrusted with health and life safety. In addition, it has become clear we will need to continue to invest in remote learning, and provide the necessary resources for employees to be able to effectively work remotely.

Uncertainty has become a key feature both in our personal and professional lives and for now, at least, it is a cloud that hangs over our budget process as well. The best way to address this uncertainty in the budget realm is to engage in planning for multiple scenarios, imagining and projecting against a number of possible short- and long-term realities. And it also means that we will be proactive in budget planning and ask for your collaboration, ingenuity and patience as we go through the process.

COVID-19 budget impacts and FY 2021 projection
The impact of COVID-19 on the campus budget is now projected to be in the range of $200 million, representing a combination of revenue losses and expenses, which we described in our April 1 message. Underpinning this projection are a number of factors in flux: We do not yet have a clear picture of what fall enrollment will look like, nor do we know what level of state funding we can expect. Insofar as state funding is concerned, given the state’s delayed tax return deadline of July 15, the state’s budget will not be finalized until August, and thus, we will not know what our funding levels will be until that time.

For this reason, we are adjusting the campus budget schedule and process. We will ask departments and divisions to prepare two separate budgets based on two different scenarios, and then once we have a sense of our fall enrollment and state funding, we will ask you to formally submit one of the two. We believe this process will allow us to be nimble once the external forces are known and also help to set expectations within departments and divisions and across campus around the possibilities we are facing.

Mitigation strategies
There are a number of strategies by which we can mitigate to some extent the impact on our budget from COVID-19. Congress has passed one piece of legislation (known as the CARES Act), which promises to bring $30 million to the Berkeley campus, $15 million of which will go directly to emergency financial assistance for students. Other federal stimulus packages are being considered which may provide funding for COVID-19 research, capital and infrastructure projects. In addition, the campus is actively investigating whether we are eligible for funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis.

Another approach that we will take is to carefully reconsider future capital projects in light of the current uncertainties.

There are strategies being considered at the systemwide level that would provide budget relief, such as a delay in merit increases and salary cuts for senior leadership; authority for those decisions rests in the UC Office of the President and will not be made soon.

Given the importance of fall enrollment to our budget picture, the campus is executing an aggressive approach to admissions, including a week of yield activities kicking off tomorrow with the start of a virtual Cal Week (in place of Cal Day, the well-known campus-wide welcome to our admitted students and community festival).

Having just recently emerged from several years of a budget deficit, we already find ourselves on a frail base, with increased reliance on revenue-generating strategies and philanthropy. After mitigation efforts, FY 2021’s deficit is projected to be in the range of $130-160 million.

The way forward
UC Berkeley’s history has been characterized by a remarkable resilience. It is our fervent hope that this will be the case as we emerge from this current crisis. Please let us continue to work together, to support each other and the most vulnerable among us, and take decisive steps to preserve our mission, which is more important now than ever.

Please take good care of yourselves and those close to you. We will be in touch soon. Please monitor the campus COVID-19 site for continuing updates.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/17/an-update-on-uc-berkeleys-budget-situation/
295,Berkeley,15-April-20,"Chancellor Carol Christ has three priorities for UC Berkeley while it responds to the COVID-19 pandemic: protect the health of students, faculty and staff; maintain educational vigor and save as many jobs as possible.

Christ and Paul Alivisatos, the executive vice chancellor and provost, spent nearly an hour Wednesday discussing how Berkeley has dealt with one of the most tumultuous months in the 152-year-old institution’s history. The talk was part of Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19, a series of live online videos featuring Berkeley experts analyzing and discussing the worldwide impacts of the new coronavirus.

The two leaders pointed to a number of ways faculty, staff and students have responded to the pandemic and shelter-in-place, including efforts to quickly spin up robotic virus tests, produce hand sanitizer for those in need and find new ways to teach lab classes online.

But many questions remain, including when normal operations will return, what the budget outlook will be and what spring commencement will look like.

“The big questions about our budget are still uncertain at this point,” Christ said, pointing to declining revenue and a promise to avoid layoffs until the end of June. “The (new student) enrollments in the fall will determine what the budget impacts will be.”

Christ and Alivisatos promised to be transparent in their decisions, and follow the guidance of public health authorities. Still, Christ said she didn’t have any doubts about Berkeley’s future.

“The dominant characteristic of Berkeley throughout its history is resilience,” she said.

416,Berkeley,9-April-20,"You’re encouraged to cover your nose and mouth with cloth when leaving home, to further reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus per the city of Berkeley. A bandana, fabric mask, neck gaiter or other cloth barrier helps prevent those who might have COVID-19 but mild or no symptoms from unknowingly spreading it to others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a guide to creating a cloth face covering out of materials you likely have at home.



The CDC and our local public health officer advise against using a surgical mask or N-95 mask unless it is a requirement of your job. Please make an effort to use your own cloth covering until campus is able to procure them. Preserve the limited supply of N-95 and surgical masks for health care workers, first responders and others who cannot use physical distance to protect themselves.

Avoid acts of bias, hostility, stereo-type threat, and/or false assumptions when interacting with individuals wearing facial coverings or masks. We encourage community discourse based on belonging and care for one another as we stand united against all forms of bias.

Please note that UC Berkeley is not currently requiring the use of a cloth face covering for campus employees who are performing an essential service. However, we are attempting to purchase a large quantity for future use. Given national shortages and long lead times, it could be several weeks before sufficient quantities are available.

Employees who are normally required to wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment as part of their job are still required to do so, and will be provided with the required equipment.

Thank you for doing your part to limit the spread of COVID-19.

381,Berkeley,6-April-20,"Last Friday UC Berkeley launched “Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19,” a series of live, online events featuring faculty experts from across the campus who are sharing what they know, and what they are learning about the pandemic. We look forward to bringing you a steady stream of engaging talks to help make sense of the crisis and global efforts to combat it. Don’t worry if you miss the live presentations; everything will be recorded and made available for viewing at any time on the Berkeley Conversations website.

Every Monday, we will provide information about events scheduled for the week ahead and beyond. Here is a listing of what’s coming up:

Tuesday, April 7, 10–11:30am (Pacific)

Creating Informed Responses: Berkeley’s Computing and Data Science In Action (live webcast)

Nobel Laureate Saul Perlmutter, Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, and Michael Lu, Dean of the Berkeley School of Public Health, will host and moderate a roundtable discussion with Berkeley researchers who are mobilizing computing and data science for COVID-19 response and recovery, from helping local public health officials track the pandemic, to predicting and addressing its impacts on employment and elections.

Friday, April 10, Noon-1:00pm (Pacific)

COVID-19: Economic Impact, Human Solutions

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis threatening to become an economic catastrophe that affects tens of millions of Americans. Is the $2 trillion aid package recently passed by Congress and signed by the president enough to keep the economy from freefall? What more is needed?

A panel of UC Berkeley’s leading economists and public policy experts will discuss the economic consequences of sheltering in place, evaluate the Congressional response and discuss strategies that could help to stabilize the economy, safeguard jobs and protect society’s most vulnerable people.

Monday, April 13 4:30–6pm (Pacific)

Coronavirus: Science and Solutions 

Berkeley’s School of Public Health will host a follow-up to its initial town hall, Coronavirus: Facts & Fears, which focused on illuminating the facts and dispelling fears around this public health crisis. Part two of this series, Coronavirus: Science and Solutions, will focus on addressing unanswered questions from the last town hall, and highlighting emerging science that will drive solutions to this and future pandemics.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/06/berkeley-conversations-covid-19-data-science-economic-impacts/
633,Berkeley,3-April-20,"We write today, in recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), to raise awareness of resources available during the COVID-19 crisis to prevent domestic and sexual violence and support survivors. Experiencing violence or harassment is always a complex and painful experience. The current circumstances may be creating unique stressors, due to being in close or constant proximity with an abusive person, lack of access to resources, and/or physical distance from support networks. Compassion and kindness toward others and self-care are needed now more than ever.

First, to survivors: We write today with an unconditional message of support. Please know that despite physical distancing, you are not alone. There are many local and national resources still available for you and ready to assist you every step of the way.

Everyone deserves support and a comprehensive list of resources can be found on the PATH to Care Center’s website. For 24/7 urgent support, call the Care Line at 510-643-2005.

For those in locations with shelter-in-place orders, seeking medical attention or privacy in order to access support resources is an appropriate reason to leave your residence.

Consider creating a network of support that agrees to check in regularly and ways to alert them if abuse or violence occurs or escalates.

If the shelter-in-place location is not physically or psychologically safe, discuss safety plans and identify alternative shelter options with confidential resources. For students in need of an on-campus housing option, contact Cal Housing at reshall@berkeley.edu.

It may be difficult to find privacy for a phone call, consider using the chat-based resources provided by the National Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Hotlines.

Reports can be made to law enforcement (UCPD or local police department) and/or to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD).

We also want to remind everyone that sexual and domestic violence and harassment are never the survivor’s fault or responsibility. Importantly, the stressors associated with COVID-19 are not an excuse and do not justify taking anger out on or harming another person. If you are concerned about your own behaviors, read about resources or call: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)

Lastly, to our campus community:  To help you prevent violence and support the survivors in your life, here are some recommendations during COVID-19:

Affirm healthy norms–virtually or in-person–by practicing respect and kindness, defining and expressing personal boundaries, supporting others by valuing and upholding their personal boundaries, and checking in with your community.

Engage in intervention even during physical distancing. We can intervene on social media, video calls, texts, as well as in person. Check-in calls via video and phone may be ways to buffer against violence at home.

Express support privately if you are concerned about someone experiencing abuse or violence. Check in with them, offer resources, and identify additional opportunities for intervention.

Express support publicly to ensure that all survivors know they are valued and supported and to promote prevention. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center, the sponsor of SAAM, has graphics and videos for social media and ways to get engaged online.

Managers, chairs, and faculty members, we know you are doing your part to make sure that UC Berkeley colleagues and students are and feel supported. We encourage you to send personalized versions of this message to your departmental community.

Finally, we want to send a deep, heartfelt thank you to the campus and community sexual and domestic violence response providers as well as the healthcare providers, first-responders, and essential personnel who are maintaining critical campus functions.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/03/resources-for-preventing-and-responding-to-sexual-and-domestic-violence/
740,Berkeley,2-April-20,"Across the UC Berkeley campus, researchers are rising to meet the complex challenges of COVID-19, even as the crisis generates waves of news and information that can be confusing and contradictory at times. In response, the university is launching a new online video series, “Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19,” to connect our experts with the public and each other. Through Q&As, seminars, and panel discussions, faculty from a wide range of disciplines – from epidemiology to economics to the computing and data now undergirding their work – will share what they know, and what they are learning.

We will offer open access to these forums every week through a new website, where it will be possible to watch live and archived conversations and consult a calendar that will list future events as they are scheduled.

The series kicks off tomorrow, Friday, April 3, at 12:30 p.m., with a Q&A focused on how we can make sense of data and information about the virus’s spread, the impact and efficacy of social distancing and the implications for our short- and long-term futures. This first Berkeley Conversation will feature:

Prof. Art. Reingold, M.D., the Division Head of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UC Berkeley School of Public Health. He has more than 40 years of experience in the prevention and control of infectious diseases at the national and global level.
Associate Provost Jennifer Chayes, who leads the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the School of Information. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her research areas include biomedicine applications and epidemiological modeling.
Updated information will be provided to the public and campus community as new events are scheduled. For now, here is a list of events scheduled for the next two weeks:

Tuesday, April 7, from 10 -11:30 a.m. (PST), Nobel Laureate Saul Perlmutter, Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, and Michael Lu, Dean of the Berkeley School of Public Health, will host and moderate a roundtable discussion with Berkeley researchers focusing on how they are mobilizing computing and data science for COVID-19 response and recovery, from helping local public health officials track outbreaks to predicting and addressing impacts on employment and elections. This conversation is titled “Creating Informed Responses: Berkeley’s Computing and Data Science In Action.”
On Friday, April 10, at  a time to be determined, we will focus on the growing financial and economic impacts of the pandemic in this country and around the world. Faculty experts will help the audience understand possible outcomes and scenarios, the likely impact of governmental actions to date and what additional steps may be needed to address an array of extraordinary challenges posed by COVID-19.
On Monday, April 13 from 4:30-6 p.m., UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health will host a follow-up to its initial town hall, “Coronavirus: Facts & Fears.” An archived version of that event can be found here. Part Two of this series, “Coronavirus: Science and Solutions,” will focus on addressing unanswered questions from the last town hall, and highlighting emerging science that will drive solutions to this and future pandemic outbreaks.
Over the course of the next several weeks, Berkeley Conversations will present faculty experts who will address a range of pressing issues, questions and concerns regarding timely research subjects including:

265,Berkeley,2-April-20,"Following the announcement on Friday, March 20 for a revised grading policy for the Spring Semester, the campus has been busy coordinating with colleges and schools to adjust requirements to allow students to take advantage of the policy.

The campus has also received queries from students, instructors, and the public about the policy and instructional resilience. Over the past two weeks, faculty and staff have compiled the questions and composed answers to them. The result of this effort can be found in the following resources:

Q&A for Students about Grading

Q&A for Instructors about Grading

Best Practises for Remote Examinations

Guidance on Copyright of Instructional Materials

Best Practices for Using Zoom

Settings for Preventing Zoom-Bombing

The Q&A resources will be updated to include additional questions and answers through the remainder of the semester.

Students and instructors have also had questions about final exams and proctoring. The Administration and the Academic Senate are working on guidance for exams and solutions to proctoring, as well as virtual classroom climate issues. Updates on these topics and other issues related to remote instruction will be posted on the campus Instructional Resilience website.

We are most grateful to the extraordinary efforts we have witnessed over the past month from staff, students, and instructors to help maintain and preserve the instructional missions of our campus. We thank you for your dedication and hard work and hope you are safe and well.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/02/faqs-for-the-spring-semester-grading-policy/
677,Berkeley,2-April-20,"This week, the city of Berkeley joined together with six other Bay Area jurisdictions to extend the shelter-in-place order through May 3. In conjunction with this extension, additional restrictions have been put in place to further reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The challenge has been, and continues to be, that asymptomatic people can feel completely fine while unknowingly endangering others. Sheltering in place has proven to be the most effective method of slowing the spread of this virus.

UC Berkeley’s early action on sheltering in place appears to have been prudent. It’s important that we remain vigilant in our efforts and take additional measures to safeguard all of us in the UC Berkeley community. Below please find a list of updated administrative guidelines to manage the extended shelter-in-place order and to assist you in working remotely effectively.

Access to campus buildings
All campus buildings will be locked beginning on Friday, April 3 at 5 p.m. Card key access will no longer work after that time for non-essential employees. Employees requesting designation as an essential employee will require their supervisor and vice chancellor approval.Employees needing emergency access to buildings should contact the UC Police Department.

Announcing building closure may tempt some individuals to beat the deadline in an attempt to  access work material or personal items. We strongly urge you to not come to campus. Provisions have been made for individuals who need ergonomic tools and peripherals from their office; please see details below.

Outdoor recreational facilities closed
Effective immediately, all outdoor recreational facilities at UC Berkeley are closed until further notice. This includes tennis courts, basketball courts, play structures, tracks, fields, and other areas. Please cooperate and stay away from these facilities to discourage the spread of COVID-19.

Temporary work-from-home agreement
If supervisors have not yet done so, they should share and request completion of  the Temporary Work from Home Agreement with each employee who is working remotely.

Employees temporarily working outside of California
Department managers or HR personnel of staff and student employees who temporarily relocated out-of-state are asked to complete and submit this form. For now, these employees will continue to be paid without adjusting their current California payroll withholding.

If the shelter-in-place order is rescinded in the near future, a reconciliation for tax purposes may be needed to adjust an individual’s tax withholding to align with their work location of temporary residence. If the shelter-in-place order is extended even further, employee records may need to be adjusted in UCPath to reflect the tax withholding of the location in which employees are working.

International Employees
Employees on a non-immigrant status choosing/or having chosen to temporarily relocate to an address that is not within the normal commuting distance to the worksite and/or outside the country should also inform the Berkeley International Office as soon as possible of their new address.

Ergonomic tips and resources for remote work
The proper ergonomics design of your computer workstation is important if you are working on campus or at home. University Health Services has ergonomics information, resources and limited matching funds to help you set up your remote workstation, including alist of pre-approved ergonomic products,instructions for purchasing and home delivery.

Additional tips for working remotely
The Office of People & Culture (formerly central Human Resources) has compiled a web resource with a curated list of tips and resources for working remotely. 

COVID-19 updates
The UC Berkeley coronavirus site continues to be updated regularly. Please check the site regularly for the latest information on this evolving situation and for an archive of past messages.

We understand that sheltering in place and working remotely is challenging but this is being cited as the most effective action we can take to combat the pandemic. Early action has proven effective; continued action will be key. Please accept my heartfelt appreciation for your individual actions in helping the university navigate this challenge. I am confident that we will get through this difficult period and emerge stronger from it",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/02/coronavirus-response-shelter-in-place-extension-and-preparations/
143,Berkeley,2-April-20,"Earlier today UC President Janet Napolitano, my fellow chancellors and I issued this message indicating that there will be no COVID-19-related layoffs of career employees through June 30, 2020 within the UC system. (Annual summer furloughs that are routinely implemented in areas such as housing and dining are not included as part of this guidance).

The Office of the President is preparing a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document to give guidance and additional details and we will share it soon with managers and supervisors and other campus leaders.

I am pleased to join fellow UC leaders in issuing this guidance as a demonstration of how much we value our employees and in recognition of the unprecedented time in which we find ourselves.

Thank you for all you do. Be well.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/02/chancellor-christ-no-covid-19-related-layoffs-through-june/
254,Berkeley,2-April-20,"We are writing to follow up on yesterday’s message regarding a campus-wide hiring freeze. What follows is our effort to answer some of the questions that we have received about academic and staff hiring during this period.

Ongoing faculty searches will be reviewed and approved under a process overseen by the Vice Provost for the Faculty; a communication is being sent to Deans and Chairs that will provide details.

For all other titles, requests for an exception to the hiring freeze should be sent through the Dean, Vice Chancellor, Vice/Associate Provost, or Associate Chancellor for the area, and will be reviewed by the Finance Committee, which consists of the Chancellor, the Provost, the Vice Chancellor for Finance, and Vice Chancellor for Administration.

We have prepared a brief FAQ that provides additional guidance about the Hiring Freeze. Further information about the exception request process will be shared with the Cabinet and Council of Deans in the coming days. We will be asking that all requests for exceptions include a brief justification for why the hire should continue. Currently running searches will receive high priority and are likely to be viewed positively if the searches are at the interview stage. Decisions on exemption requests for current searches will be made within a week of receipt by the Finance Committee.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/02/additional-guidance-on-hiring-freeze/
698,Berkeley,1-April-20,"We are writing today to share the latest information regarding the campus budget, our principles for decision making, and our initial recommendations.

The budget challenges we face related to the COVID-19 pandemic are becoming increasingly apparent. The Regents, recognizing the magnitude of the public health crisis, have set aside what was an advanced plan for a cohort tuition increase. Similarly, the governor must cope with unprecedented new challenges; hence, he has told us to expect, at best, a flat budget from the state. Anticipated Summer Session and University Extension revenues are down; additionally, we face an uncertain enrollment picture for the fall, particularly in regard to out-of-state and international students. We also face immediate losses in revenue and anticipated revenue—from cancellation of housing and dining contracts, as well as the cessation of all public gatherings such as those of Cal Performances and intercollegiate athletics. In addition, some of our expenses (technology upgrades to support online teaching and remote working, for example) have increased sharply.

The longer that normal operations are disrupted, the more dire the situation becomes. Current estimates place the budget impact of all of this in excess of $100 million and growing.

Campus Priorities
From the beginning of this emergency, the campus has put its teaching and research missions and protecting the health and safety of our community at the fore. We also continue to actively address the concerns and interests of our students and their families.

Now we turn to you asking that we seek ways to pull together so that we can save jobs, with the same spirit of cooperation and ingenuity that we have used thus far in facing the pandemic.

We are considering a number of proactive, budget-conserving actions to protect jobs. We can implement some measures on our own as a campus; in other areas we must wait for guidance from the UC Office of the President as the decisions have system-wide implications. We will be writing in the coming days in more detail about steps we can take to address these challenges. In addition, we will consult with our faculty and staff experts to inform and assist us in making decisions that are the best possible socially and economically for our employees.

Campus-wide hiring freeze
Today we are instituting a campus-wide hiring freeze. We therefore ask that you do not initiate any new searches and suspend those that have already begun. The Office of People and Culture (formerly central human resources) is completing work on a hiring-freeze plan which will be shared with managers and supervisors shortly. The campus will be making very limited exceptions to the hiring freeze, making only select hires that protect against a significant business disruption and/or a significant health, safety, or ethical compliance risk. All academic hiring requests will be carefully reviewed by the Provost’s office.

We also ask that you carefully monitor expenses as we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year and hold off on any major expenditures until our budget picture becomes clearer. Please consult with your manager/supervisor or department/division head for guidance.

On a related note, our campus has been at the forefront of advocating for state and federal assistance and we will continue to push for these avenues of support, some of which will directly benefit our students.

We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this important financial modeling and analysis.

Concern for your well-being
We acknowledge that this is an incredibly stressful and trying time for everyone: those working to balance work and family, those facing health challenges and worried about the health of loved ones, those with financial hardship, and those for whom the uncertainty of our current reality is overwhelming. We are working in numerous ways to alleviate some of these burdens and invite you to make use of campus resources if needed. Please refer to the campus COVID-19 website for all other information; it is being continuously updated and has a form to submit questions.

Meantime, take good care and we will continue to share information as decisions are made.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/01/coronavirus-response-financial-impacts-of-covid-19/
139,Berkeley,31-Mar-20,"Sitting in front of their computers in homes and offices across the Bay Area, six of UC Berkeley’s top administrators joined a shared video conference call last week to update the campus community on how the school is responding to the coronavirus pandemic.

The group, which included leaders like Chancellor Carol Christ and Steven Sutton, vice chancellor of student affairs, spoke and took questions for 50 minutes.

Topics included how researchers are responding to the shelter-in-place order, how students can cope and how staff should stay connected to their work and colleagues while working from home.

601,Berkeley,27-Mar-20,"Tomorrow is Cesar Chavez Day, a holiday honoring the principles of fairness, social justice, and the struggle for equity in the workplace and all of society. As we continue to adjust to our new reality created by COVID-19, both with respect to work and our personal lives, it is more important than ever to pause and think about the broader values and personal meaning that this day represents. Managers should encourage all employees (unless required to perform emergency services) to take the time to rest, reflect and renew. We offer special recognition to those who continue to maintain our critical campus operations during this crisis and who support the most vulnerable members of our community.

These are uncertain times. As the news and guidance around COVID-19 change and intensify, it is normal to feel overwhelmed and experience stress and anxiety. The current circumstances are particularly difficult for those who do not have necessary resources, or for whom home or the location of shelter is not physically or psychologically safe.

Please know that despite social distance, you are not alone. Campus resources are still available for you, including those listed at the end of this message. We also invite you to compassionately support others, as you are able. Everyone deserves support.

We are so grateful for how Berkeley staff and faculty are finding time to come together with their colleagues in healthy and creative ways during this crisis. We encourage you to read this Berkeley News article about how some of our community members are connecting via virtual happy hours, online art classes, livestreamed yoga sessions, and more. The central campus is looking into other methods of bringing us together while we’re physically apart, and is collecting suggestions for how to make the best of our current situation. We encourage you to view and take part in these efforts.

With best wishes for your well-being on Cesar Chavez Day, and all those to follow.

Your communications with my office have been thoughtful, kind, and compassionate, and for that I am deeply grateful. We find ourselves in uncharted waters in having to make a decision about something as special as commencement. We all love commencement, and you all are certainly so very deserving of a meaningful celebration that honors all of your hard work and accomplishments at Berkeley.

For the latest updates
Visit Berkeley’s coronavirus information page

I am writing today to let you know that due to the continuing public health threat posed by COVID-19, we have decided to postpone the May 16 all-campus commencement. This was a difficult decision, but we heard so many of you when you asked for a decision so that you can move forward with your own plans. In the coming days, you will also be hearing from your school, college, and affinity groups regarding plans for those specific graduation ceremonies.

This is a postponement, and as a next step, we would like your advice on how and when we mark this milestone in your lives. Your achievements certainly warrant a celebration, and we hope that you will ring in with your thoughts. We could set a date later in the summer in the hope that conditions improve sufficiently. We could invite you to participate in the December 2020 or the May 2021 ceremonies, or we could hold a virtual celebration on the original May 16, 2020 date. We want to hear from you. Please consider participating in this survey to help us find a new path forward.

You are the lifeblood of this campus and we share your sadness and frustration that we won’t be able to proceed with our traditional May commencement.

740,Berkeley,20-Mar-20,"As we head into spring break, I would like to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to each and every one of you for helping our campus navigate the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the course of just a few weeks, the rapid spread of the virus into the Bay Area has turned a relatively normal Berkeley semester upside down. To slow the rate of infection and keep our community safe, we canceled in-person gatherings and asked instructors to move hundreds of classes out of lecture halls and onto the internet. Researchers were directed away from their labs and encouraged to think creatively about what work they could do from home. Staff took on new responsibilities as they shepherded our campus through a period of incredible change. And students endeavored to keep up their studies, undeterred by new class formats and without the support of nearby friends and mentors.

These transitions would have been monumental on their own, but their effects have been compounded by the upheavals taking place throughout society. Many of us are now playing the role of full-time teacher to our children or grandchildren, unexpectedly sharing homes with our parents, turning kitchen tables into office or study spaces, and adapting to other transformations in our ways of life. The effects of the outbreak are uneven, too, exposing disparities based on age, wealth, living situation, access to childcare, access to food, and more. Beneath daily disruptions lie greater worries about the virus itself, and the lasting effects this pandemic may have on our world.

Given the context, the efforts you are making to keep our community safe and our academic enterprise moving forward are nothing short of heroic. I want to thank you, on behalf of our whole campus and from the bottom of my heart.

“
We are in the midst of a disruption unlike any in recent memory, but I am so proud and grateful to see such a spirit of community emerge even in spite of that.

– Carol Christ

In a 2009 book, Berkeley alum and author Rebecca Solnit set out to uncover how local communities responded when faced with catastrophic events like the 1985 Mexico City earthquake or 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. She found that out of chaos and grief there often emerged, paradoxically, a profound spirit of generosity, connection, and collective purpose. During dark times, she wrote, we tend to become more supportive of those around us, more understanding, more giving and forgiving, and more in touch with our common humanity.

This phenomenon is now taking shape right in front of our eyes. I see it when our staff bring cookies from canceled events to workers providing essential services to the campus. I see it in the way our teaching listservs buzz with instructors sharing tips on improving digital pedagogy. I see it in the relentlessness of our biomedical researchers, who are working nonstop to develop diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19. I see it in the huge outpouring of support we’ve received from alumni to our student emergency fund. I see it in the fact that campus offices are coming together for digital happy hours at the close of a long work day. I see it in the creative ways our students are using technology to keep in touch, building strong bonds even in a time of turmoil.

We are in the midst of a disruption unlike any in recent memory, but I am so proud and grateful to see such a spirit of community emerge even in spite of that. Though our friends and colleagues may appear only on a screen, and though our memories of a lively campus – the bustle of Memorial Glade on a sunny afternoon, the coziness of the Morrison Reading Room on a dark evening – feel far away, we are nevertheless keeping our sense of Berkeley alive through these many acts of love, generosity, and connection-building.

I am certain that our old way of life will come back, and promise to keep you informed as we learn more about how and when this will occur. For now, please be vigilant about protecting your health and the health of others. Work hard and study hard. This too shall pass, and when it does, we will return to Berkeley and each other with an even greater appreciation of what our wonderful community represents.

Thank you for everything you do for our institution.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/20/a-message-of-gratitude-from-chancellor-carol-christ/
525,Berkeley,20-Mar-20,"The campus has faced tremendous challenges in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decisions and actions have been taken at an extraordinary pace and the response from our community has been inspirational. Guiding the decision making has been the principle of prioritizing the health and well-being of the community. In addition, every effort has been made to preserve the instructional and research missions of our university.

In response to the unusual and challenging circumstances that instructors and students are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we write to let you know that the Academic Senate has approved the following changes for the spring 2020 semester:

The default grading basis for all undergraduate courses for the spring 2020 semester will be changed to Passed/Not Passed (P/NP).

Instructors must continue to maintain and submit records of letter grades earned.

Students will be permitted to change their grading option to letter grade until at least May 6, 2020 (the Wednesday of RRR week).

The policy does not apply to courses that can only be taken P/NP. The exact deadline during RRR week for changing grading options will be announced at a later date.

Further, the Divisional Council (DIVCO) and Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI), on behalf of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, have authorized the temporary suspension of some regulations. This has enabled schools and colleges to temporarily modify requirements for students affected by the COVID-19 emergency and ensure that progress toward a degree or a minor will not be affected should a student take a class P/NP. A notation will be included on transcripts indicating the exceptional change to grading during spring 2020.

Graduate students may change the grading of their courses to Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) until Friday, May 8, 2020. As part of the relaxation of regulations approved, graduate programs may increase the fraction of S/U courses that can count toward degree requirements beyond the existing cap of 1/3. We remind instructors that they must continue to maintain and submit records of letter grades earned.

Advice and additional details on implementation of these policies to students will be forthcoming by the end of next week and we ask students for their patience. Rest assured your health and well-being is our primary concern. Companion messaging and guidance on the policy will be sent to instructors, staff, and student advisors; we are very grateful to them for the additional effort that will be required to implement the policy.

We thank all of you for your efforts to maintain the mission of our campus. The sacrifices you are making now will save lives and help to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. This time will pass and will become a chapter in our campus’s history that we can all be proud of. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and your loved ones.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/20/coronavirus-response-grading-policies-for-the-spring-semester/
949,Berkeley,20-Mar-20,"We are writing with updates related to COVID-19. First, a message of thanks for all you are doing to adapt to our new reality of remotely delivered instruction, social distancing, and sheltering in place. It has been a radical and abrupt change in all aspects of our lives and we appreciate your patience as we work to protect the health of the members of our campus community while trying to preserve our mission.

You all are likely aware that Governor Newsom issued a statewide executive order yesterday. The Governor’s order complements the Bay Area orders, so it doesn’t reflect a change for our campus and the directives that have been issued about coming to work.

Cases of COVID-19 associated with the campus
We reported on our first case last Saturday, March 14 in this message.

Health experts advise that COVID-19 has been circulating widely in the Bay Area for some time and it is highly likely that many of us have come into contact with an infected individual. As you probably know, testing is not widely available in the Bay Area. The virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were widely available, testing would reveal that many of us have already been exposed to this virus.

The primary public health strategy now is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. Local public health authorities are no longer tracing contacts between people who test positive and others except in exceptional circumstances.

We are giving students in our residence halls more information to assist them in making choices to leave campus housing if they are able. We are committed to remaining operational for those who need or wish to remain housed on campus. We will continue to  alter our dining hall operations to mitigate the spread of the virus. We have provided detailed information and instructions to students with housing and dining contracts.

Travel
The U.S. Department of State has issued a Global Level 4/Do Not Travel advisory this afternoon.

If your university-related travel has been affected by COVID-19, please visit the Berkeley Travel Office website for information about reimbursement.

Additionally, for business travelers who booked their travel through Connexxus and are currently traveling and,

are in need of emergency assistance related to making changes to their travel reservations or,
need assistance for medical referral, evacuation, repatriation, or other emergency services unrelated to specific travel reservations (services listed here are also available to business travelers that may not have booked through Connexxus but registered their travel with the UC Travel Insurance program):
Please consult the emergency assistance page of the UC Berkeley Travel site.

Events
Campus units have cancelled events and event reservations through April 7. The current policy regarding campus events and updates as they become available will be posted on the Berkeley News COVID-19 information website. We have not yet made a decision about spring commencement activities.

Parking
While we have been clear about having everyone stay away from campus, we recognize there are very limited situations where someone will need to be on campus. For that reason, we have suspended parking restrictions and will not be issuing tickets. The only exceptions are that you are not permitted to park in fire lanes or reserved spaces, or disabled spaces without a placard, and there is still no parking between 2am and 5am. For more information about parking and transportation during this time, please visit the parking website.

Well-being
We  recognize that many people are experiencing heightened anxiety and fear in response to the current pandemic and the uncertainty it brings. While we all strive to support each other as a community, at times, it may also be useful to connect with formal resources for assistance.

You can access free, confidential support from a licensed mental health professional through Be Well at Work – Employee Assistance. Appointments, including phone and video options are available, and can be scheduled:

By email – employeeassistance@berkeley.edu OR
By phone – 510-643-7754

Please protect your health with these tips to prevent illness and tips to prepare your household from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and review this help from UC health plans.

Principles of Community
We have been made aware of xenophobic acts on our campus and want everyone to know in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is wrong, goes against our values and violates our Principles of Community. If you experience this or any other form of race- or ethnicity-based targeting, please report it at our Stop Hate website. Now is the time to be practicing compassion and kindness, recognizing that each of us is operating in a state of uncertainty.

We will continue to keep you updated as decisions are made and we have pertinent information to share. Meantime, please take care of yourselves and be well.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/20/coronavirus-response-update-to-campus-on-covid-19/
886,Berkeley,19-Mar-20,"We understand that many students are still considering whether they want to remain in campus-operated student housing for the remainder of the semester. We are writing to provide you with updated information about what we anticipate the conditions in our resident housing may be, based upon the most current public health information available to the campus.

We are committed to supporting all of our students through this outbreak, especially those who remain in campus residence halls and apartments. This information is concerning, but we want you to know the latest information, so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. We fully appreciate that for many of you, leaving campus housing is not an option.  For those of you who do have the option to move, you can find information about relief from the financial obligations of your housing agreements on the Housing Move Out/COVID-19 webpage. You can also find the form needed to be relieved from your financial obligations under your housing agreement here. Yesterday, the head of the UC Health System advised students who are able to make the choice to move out of the residence halls should do so in order to enable social distancing protocols for those who need to remain.

We have confirmed with the City of Berkeley Public Health Department that it is not a violation of the shelter-in-place order to move out of campus housing.

Exposure to COVID-19

We do not anticipate that every campus environment can be managed to avoid exposing people to COVID-19, given what public health authorities have told the public about the existing conditions of widespread community transmission of the virus in the Bay Area. As you probably know, testing is not widely available in the Bay Area. The virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were available, testing would reveal that many of us have already been exposed to this virus. That includes the people who live near you, the residential staff that support your residential experience, and the dedicated people who prepare and serve your meals and clean your facilities.

The primary public health strategy is now mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals.  Local public health authorities are no longer tracing contacts between people who test positive and others except in exceptional circumstances. We want to prepare you for the reality that the dense living conditions of campus housing make it inevitable that you will be told that that people living in and supporting campus housing have tested positive.

It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residence halls or apartments. We have a limited ability to house these students off campus, but we anticipate that those off-campus resources will be exhausted quickly as more people become ill. Inevitably, students who are ill will be living in some proximity to students who are well. We will, of course, provide as much physical distance as we can between students who are ill and those who are not ill, and implement other measures to avoid exposure to people who are ill, as much as we are able.

Dining

The campus is attempting to move as quickly as possible to provide boxed and to-go meals, instead of serving food in dining halls. You should expect that in the future, residents may not be permitted to sit and eat together. While taking your meal to go is currently available, switching to boxed meals only will be a challenging goal to achieve. Reconfiguring our dining operation in this manner is not simple. We are concerned that as staff become ill, we will not have enough people to support the labor-intensive effort necessary to prepare individual meals. Everyone on the globe is attempting to buy the supplies necessary to provide meals to go, at a time when production of those materials has been slowed by the impacts of the virus.

It may therefore be necessary, in order for us to provide for appropriate social distancing, for us to assign you to a staggered meal time, or require you to eat in your room, or outdoors, or otherwise manage your dining experience in a manner that is not convenient for you. We will be flexible if your assigned meal time conflicts with a time you need to be online for a class.

Housing assignments

Depending upon how many people move out of campus housing, and how many people become ill, it is possible that you will be required to move to another unit, possibly more than once. If this is necessary we commit to you that it will be accomplished in an orderly way, in accordance with the recommendations of public health authorities.

We acknowledge that this information will add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you. Please take advantage of these campus resources for support.

934,Berkeley,18-Mar-20,"The adoption of the Bay Area shelter-in-place was a dramatic action that has suddenly changed all of our lives. The University’s employees are permitted by the shelter-in-place orders to continue to come to work in order to carry out the University’s essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work at the campus to perform duties related to distance learning and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and research continuity.

This Executive Order issues directions regarding which employees and faculty members are permitted to come to campus today through April 7, while the Alameda County shelter-in-place order is in effect, for the purpose of carrying out remote instruction and engaging in essential research activities. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.

Please see the detailed information below. These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.

Who this directive covers
This message is a formal employment directive issued by the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost and the Vice Chancellor for Administration and it applies to all employees and faculty, including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers, who are engaged in instruction and research activities. This directive does not apply to those employees who already are working from home except as necessary to support essential activities, consistent with the direction of their supervisor. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Employees and faculty who come to campus for reasons inconsistent with this directive are subject to discipline.

Remote instruction
Employees and faculty members may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. We have suspended our course capture service as of today. As you make the change to fully-remote instruction, please visit our Instructional Resilience Resources site to take advantage of the virtual consultation services (outlined below) offered by Research Teaching and Learning (RLT). The team is here to support you as best as possible as you transition in a virtual environment. We offer individual virtual consultations with staff who can help guide you on best practices and technical tools. Consultation services can be scheduled in the following ways:

For virtual 1:1 consultations with the Center for Teaching and Learning schedule at http://bit.ly/CTL-Consult
For Zoom/bCourses virtual tutorials and webinars with Digital Learning Services schedule at http://bit.ly/DLSconsultations
Research
Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may engage in only those research continuity activities that have been specifically approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. See CalMessages of March 9 and March 17 for further detail. If you are uncertain as to whether the research activity that you are presently supporting is approved to continue during this period, fill in this form by 5 pm today. PIs will be notified about whether they have approval to continue their research on a rolling basis starting March 18, through March 20.

No one supporting the campus research enterprise can come to campus to support or engage in activities that have not been designated by the campus as appropriate. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, please contact the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies, or the Assistant Vice Chancellor for People & Culture.

Building access
Please be advised that suspension of building access (including key-card access) to many campus administrative and research buildings is imminent. This action is necessary to secure and clean campus buildings. Building managers will be informed prior to suspension of access and will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.

Supervisors, chairs, and building managers should begin compiling lists of employees and faculty who will continue to require building access on an exceptional basis in order to enable distance learning activities and research activities approved by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. Employees and faculty who believe that they should have such access should immediately communicate their needs to their supervisor or department chair.

When working from home has limitations
Instructors and the staff who support them may come to campus in order to access the internet and other campus resources for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. No employee or faculty member supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their office to work, for purposes other than delivering instruction, solely because their home internet access is not adequate or because their conditions at home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently.  The University understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. The campus has adopted an emergency procurement process to enable employees and faculty to obtain equipment and internet access to enable them to work from home. Employees and faculty who need these resources should request them from their supervisor or Chair.

A word of thanks
We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and reiterate that these changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place order, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university.

Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times, and be well.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/18/coronavirus-response-executive-order-regarding-remote-instruction-and-research/
627,Berkeley,18-Mar-20,"Our community has pulled together in positive and innovative ways in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The expanding outbreak and the current Bay Area shelter-in-place orders mandate that we be more explicit in how we respond to this growing public health challenge.

Further, we understand there may be some confusion or lack of clarity regarding what members of the campus community can do in their work capacity (and when they should and should not come to campus to work) in light of previous campus messages and various shelter-in-place orders, including from Alameda County and the City of Berkeley. This memo supersedes all earlier communications, except the Executive Order regarding distance learning and research issued earlier today.

The information below reflects directives from the University; they are not guidelines. All employees, staff and students must adhere to these directives. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Employees and faculty may be disciplined for failing to observe these directives.

Dos
Do come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation of the University. If you believe that the operation you are supporting is not essential but there is an expectation that you come to work anyway, you may seek confirmation of the essential nature of your work by emailing the Chief Human Resources Officer.

Do come to campus if your supervisor directs you to do so for a specific or limited purpose, even if you are generally working from home. You are allowed to come to work for this purpose.

Do feel free to park in any designated campus parking lot if you are directed to come to work.  Daytime parking lot enforcement has been suspended so that employees may avoid taking public transportation if they choose to do so.

Do feel free to visit the campus COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address loneliness and isolation that may occur while we are  under the shelter-in-place order.

Don’ts
Do not come to work if you are sick.

Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave.

Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down or continuity work as approved and directed by the Vice Chancellor for Research. Separate, specific guidance has been issued to campus researchers.

Do not come to work solely because your home internet access is inadequate, or because the conditions at your home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently.  The University understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. The campus has adopted an emergency procurement process to enable employees and faculty to obtain equipment and internet access to enable them to work from home. Employees and faculty who need these resources should address their needs with their supervisor or department chair.

Do not come to campus because there is something in your office that you would like to retrieve, or because you want to visit with colleagues who must work on campus. You should only be coming to campus if your supervisor has given you express permission  to do so. Your supervisor can give you permission to come to campus on a one-time basis or as otherwise necessary.

We know that these are challenging times and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through these issues. These directives are designed to further protect our campus community and give you confidence that your work is consistent with the shelter-in-place orders in the Bay Area. These directives are intended to safeguard the maintenance of the campus’s essential and critical operations. Please take care of yourselves and be well.

1236,Berkeley,17-Mar-20,"Over the weekend, public health officials confirmed a UC Berkeley graduate student has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). The individual is self-isolating and is in good condition and has no serious symptoms. Public health officials have determined that there are no high risk contacts from this case, meaning no one is at significantly higher risk of contracting it from the infected individual than would be expected in the general population. You should continue to monitor your health and if you exhibit COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath), contact your physician or University Health Services (UHS). More information can be found at news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/ and news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/17/what-uc-berkeley-students-need-to-know-about-coronavirus/.

We recognize that moving to remote instruction for the remainder of the semester, dealing with the shelter-in-place order, working remotely, facing closures in the community, and possibly juggling childcare responsibilities is incredibly challenging. We are here to support you.

Financial Aid and Scholarships, Other Administrative Support
As a reminder, as long as you remain enrolled in a class through the end of the semester, your financial aid will not be affected by your decision to leave or remain on-campus. Additionally, future residency determinations will take into account these special circumstances – you won’t be penalized for leaving.

We continue to provide online and phone advising for billing and payment, financial aid, and registrar inquiries. Common requests:

For additional financial aid, apply for an Emergency Loan and select the EFT (Direct Deposit) option or submit a Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request.
Sign up for Direct Deposit, a fast, convenient, safe, and reliable way to have payments you receive deposited directly to your bank account. Signing up for direct deposit is the most efficient way to get your payments.
Visit CalCentral, “Profile” to update your local address, if appropriate.
Request Transcripts or Verification of Enrollment. Review the “Academic Records” section in the “My Academics” tab of CalCentral. You will see options for “Transcript – Undergraduate or Graduate Student” and “Enrollment Verification.”

Housing
Students in on-campus housing should watch for additional messages with more details. If you live in on-campus undergraduate housing and choose to end your contract, you can estimate your refund. You will receive one full installment refund along with a partial installment refund based on your cancellation date – April 1, April 10, or April 20. For reference, there are 10 installments for the year (five in the Fall and five in the Spring). You can see all of the installments in CalCentral under “My Finances,” “Billing Summary”. Your decision to stay or move out will not affect your financial aid package. Students will receive their refund minus any outstanding charges (only affects a very small number of students).

Students in off-campus private residence (apartments or houses), may be responsible for paying rent for the remainder of the term of your lease. Read more about terminating your lease at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/terminatinglease.

Supporting Your Physical Health
Students are encouraged to contact the UHS advice line (Nurse Advice Line (24/7) at (510) 643-7197) if they have symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, or had close sustained contact with a known positive case of COVID-19 (as a reminder, public health officials have determined the graduate student who tested positive did not have high risk contacts). We encourage everyone to view the helpful resource information we have circulated, including social distancing and tips on proper hygiene, such as lathering your hands and washing for at least 20 seconds, on the UHS website.

Supporting Your Mental Health
As the situation continues to evolve feelings of uncertainty, anxiety and fear can be overwhelming. Students, faculty and staff are dealing with sudden changes to their regular schedules and worry about what comes next for themselves, friends and family.  We encourage you to reach out for support if you need it. Counselors at University Health Services (UHS) at the Tang Center are available for urgent concerns: Counseling and Psychological Services website or (510) 642-9494 (after-hours counseling line (855) 817-5667). We also offer students support with medical withdrawal (for physical or psychological reasons), if appropriate. Here are some additional tips to help:

Be proactive about managing stress
Taking care of your physical and emotional health during uncertain times is key. Get tipis and resources around mental health and coping.
Pay attention to your stress level and prioritize stress management. Practice self care by talking to friends, exercising, and taking breaks will help your academic performance.
Visit recalibrate for wellness information and resources targeted at the entire campus community.
Sleep
There is good evidence that high-quality sleep (roughly 7-9 hours for the average person) significantly improves task performance, learning, and memory.
Sleep and anxiety are often interrelated and improving sleep quality appears to lessen generalized anxiety.
Seek help
Getting help is a sign of strength and resiliency. Visit the Office of the Dean of Students’ Mental Health Matters to learn how we are in this together.
If stress is interfering with your life (socially or academically) or if you find yourself depressed or anxious for weeks or longer, this will interfere with your ability to learn and perform academically. Talk to a professional mental health counselor. Confidential campus counselors at University Health Services at the Tang Center are available on a drop-in basis for urgent concerns. There are also new online self-help tools. Visit the CAPS website, call Counseling and Psychological Services at (510) 642-9494, or, when the Tang Center is closed, call the after-hours counseling line (855) 817-5667.
It’s okay if you need help. You are not alone. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 800-273-TALK (8255).
In addition to taking care of yourself, please be mindful of other students facing similar challenges this time of year. Download the Just in Case Berkeley mobile app to get tips to help you cope or help a friend and emergency information.

Staying Healthy
We continue to encourage hand-washing and social distancing by leaving at least 6 ft. of space between yourself and others when you are outside of your room or apartment. This includes walking around outside, eating at a dining hall, or visiting the library. Here are some other ways to stay healthy.

Finally, please continue to keep our Principles of Community in mind. Don’t forget to practice grace, empathy, and compassion towards yourself and others. We will get through this moment in time together.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/17/coronavirus-response-important-reminders-and-support-for-students/

1069,Berkeley,16-Mar-20,"Following up on a campus wide message earlier today and in response to a rapidly changing environment around COVID-19 and the urgent need to practice social distancing, the campus is taking the following actions. These directives are consistent with and authorized by recently announced “shelter in place” guidance from several Bay Area counties, including Alameda County and the City of Berkeley.

Instruction
Effective immediately, all in-person instruction is cancelled for the remainder of the semester unless and until the campus announces that in-person instruction may resume. There will be no exceptions. Kudos and thanks to instructors and our Digital Learning Services staff for making the majority of our courses remotely accessible; we must continue to move aggressively in this direction. As reported earlier, remote instruction will be provided through the end of the semester. Executive Vice Chancellor & Provost Paul Alivisatos and Academic Senate Chair Oliver O’Reilly will communicate more specific information to instructors.

Housing/Dining
As we advised earlier, students who live in campus housing and Blackwell Hall may choose to leave Berkeley and obtain prorated relief from the payment obligations of their housing contracts. The Berkeley health department has confirmed that the “shelter in place” order does not prevent students from moving out of our student housing facilities to reside somewhere else.  We will keep residence and dining facilities open under these emergency circumstances so long as there is a need to do so. More information is available at the COVID-19 Housing website.  The Basic Needs Center, including the Food Pantry, will move to 103 Sproul Hall.

Research
Our research community is directed to immediately transition to work remotely whenever possible. Principal Investigators should suspend on-campus research to the greatest extent possible, immediately, and implement plans to operate remotely at least through April 7. Essential access, limited to sustaining research capability, such as animal care, servicing of critical instrumentation, and maintenance of germ lines, will be authorized by the Vice Chancellor for Research Office in coordination with Deans and Chairs. Exceptional access will be considered by a campus review process, which is currently being developed, modeled on the one at the University of California, San Francisco. Please visit the Vice Chancellor for Research website for specific information and more detailed guidance. The VC Research will also send out a more specific email with guidance on identification of critical research continuity needs.

Staff
Staff who are not explicitly instructed to work at  the campus in person should not come to work. Managers and supervisors will assess what services need to continue on the campus to protect and serve students in residence and maintain other critical operations, such as delivery of remote learning, student housing/dining, University Health Services, etc. Employees will receive direction from their managers if they are required to come to the campus in order to work.  People who are working from home should continue to do so.  California Gov. Newsom has advised anyone over the age of 65 to remain at home; the campus intends to support this goal. More specific information is forthcoming to managers and supervisors.

Libraries, Student Spaces and Events
All libraries will be closed. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Student Union, Eshleman Hall and Cesar Chavez Hall will be closed. The Recreational Sports Facility (RSF) will be closed.  Many other campus facilities have already closed or will be closed, check their websites for current information.  The campus will assess whether limited operation of these facilities is possible and will announce the conditions under which these facilities may reopen if operation of the facilities is determined to be both consistent with public health directives and feasible.

All public events planned to take place on the campus prior to April 7, 2020, should be cancelled or rescheduled.  No new event reservations should be accepted by any facility manager until further notice. We have not yet made a decision about commencement-related events in May.

General campus operations
When buildings close tonight, they will remain locked and will require card-key access for entry. If your building has metal key entry, consult with your manager to determine your need and ability to gain access.

Cleaning of public spaces has increased. Custodial staff is being informed about when special or deep cleaning is warranted and is responding accordingly. We greatly appreciate the extra efforts that our staff are making.

We realize this information and these directives might add to already heightened anxiety and fear. We are making these decisions based on our interest in protecting the members of our community and the vulnerable populations in the greater Bay Area. We look forward to the day when we can return to normal operations and the vibrant, bustling campus that we all know and love. For now, though, we strongly urge everyone to take measures to protect your own health and safety and that of the community at large and to practice social distancing. There is helpful guidance about social distancing in this New York Times article and interesting simulations about the impact of social distancing in this Washington Post article. In the interest of mental and physical health (and in keeping with various county and city directives), we urge you to try to get outside (maintaining a distance of six feet between you and others). The American Psychological Association posted this advice, which you may also find helpful.

Also, please note that while the shelter in place guidance appears to be very broad, it does have certain exceptions including for essential services and certain entities, including institutions of higher education like ours. We are being careful not to direct any of our employees to do anything that could violate this order. In addition, the county and city orders state that those sheltering in place may engage in “essential activities as necessary for the health and safety for individuals and their families.”

The University Health Services website and the campus COVID-19 website are both valuable sources of information and are being continually updated. We are deeply grateful to those working in University Health Services who continue to care for the members of our community.

This is an unprecedented and dramatic event, yet we are in many ways well prepared for emergencies such as this. We are committed to doing all we can to support our students and employees. Please take care of yourselves and each other. Together, we will get through this.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/16/uc-berkeley-takes-additional-actions-to-encourage-social-distancing/
210,Berkeley,16-Mar-20,"In light of Alameda County and the City of Berkeley’s announcement advising county residents to shelter in place beginning Tuesday, March 17 at 12:01 a.m. through Tuesday, April 7, we are rapidly moving toward a “maintenance-only” mode of physical operation of the campus.

Generally speaking, this means that all in-person instruction should cease. All instruction that can be delivered remotely should continue.

Labs should ramp down normal operations, and shift to basic maintenance, ensuring safety and preservation of future capability.

With rare exceptions (including those in student-facing functions that cannot be offered remotely like housing, dining, and University Health Services and critical operations such as UCPD, facilities, custodial, information systems and technology, maintenance of certain critical research specimens, etc.), employees should return home as soon as they are able, and where possible, work remotely.

Generally, employees should assume they will work from home through April 7 unless they hear otherwise from their managers. For those who cannot work from home due to the nature of their job, UCOP is working on systemwide guidance which they will issue shortly.

We are working quickly to gather more information and will provide additional details later this afternoon. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

549,Berkeley,14-Mar-20,"UPDATED Saturday, March 14, 2020, 7:45 p.m.: Public health officials have determined that there are no high risk contacts from this case, meaning that no one is at significantly higher risk of contracting it from the infected individual than would be expected in the general population.

People should continue to monitor their health and be in touch with their physician or University Health Services if they are exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms.

We’re writing to share that we have confirmed that a member of our campus community has contracted COVID-19. The individual is a graduate student who does not live on campus property or in the city of Berkeley and has self-isolated in their city of residence. The individual is in good condition and has no serious symptoms.

For the latest updates

We are coordinating closely with public health officials and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  state and local health guidance in responding to this case. University Health Services (UHS) professionals are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who need to be advised about their contacts with this student.

We understand that this news is unsettling, but we want to assure you that your health and safety remain our number one priority. Facilities personnel will be alerted and will provide deep cleaning to any appropriate areas. We are also coordinating to make sure that the student is getting the care needed.

Due to privacy concerns, we will not release any information involving specific student records or private health care information, but our safety protocols have been activated in order to mitigate further exposure.

We understand that some members of our community may be concerned that they have the virus. This may include circumstances where you have had contact with someone you believe or know to have the virus. Students should contact the UHS advice line at (510) 643-7197, and faculty and staff should contact their medical providers, if they have symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, or had close sustained contact with a known positive case of COVID-19. Most other situations simply require self-monitoring for symptoms, reasonable social distancing strategies, good hand-washing and cough etiquette, and regular cleaning of frequently- touched surfaces. Faculty, staff and students are strongly encouraged to stay home when ill.

The virus is circulating within our broader community, and as tests become more widely available, we will hear of more confirmed cases. This is a reality that the campus has been preparing for and is ready for, in terms of protocols established in coordination with local public health authorities and in our new policies designed to limit large gatherings on campus.

In the meantime, we encourage everyone to view the helpful resource information, including tips on proper hygiene, such as lathering your hands and washing for at least 20 seconds, as well as mental health resources, on the UHS website.

The situation regarding COVID-19 is dynamic, and, consequently, guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information.

78,Berkeley,13-Mar-20,"With local schools temporarily closing due to coronavirus concerns, many of our employees will have to take time off work to provide childcare. We will now grant up to 14 days of paid administrative leave for employees who have to stay home, and who are unable to work remotely, because they must provide childcare to their children whose schools have closed due to coronavirus concerns. Managers and supervisors are asked to grant their employees permission for these requests.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/13/uc-berkeley-offers-14-days-paid-leave-to-parents-with-children-home-from-school/
878,Berkeley,13-Mar-20,"We have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely via Zoom, teleconferencing and other virtual platforms for lecture, discussion, and seminar courses (as well as other types of courses such as laboratory, clinic, and studio courses, that have already successfully developed strategies for remote learning) through the end of the semester. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority.

We also are committed to preserving our academic mission. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to more students in non-lecture courses and settings. For the small number of courses that do not have a remote option, students will need to get guidance from their instructors on how they are adopting social distancing practices, which ideally leaves six feet of space between individuals. More information to instructors is forthcoming today.

We will support students and families in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break. They will be allowed to do so. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.).
Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees if they decide to move out.  The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts from students who decide to move out of campus housing and Blackwell Hall for the remainder of this academic year.  The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid by these students, based upon their effective move-out date. Students will have the choice to receive relief from payment obligations based upon an effective move-out date of April 1, April 10, or April 20. Students who want to move out must complete their written request and move out prior to April 20.  The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the student’s campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student’s housing costs are covered by the student’s financial aid package. FAQS, further guidance, specific details, and online forms to complete to obtain housing refunds are being developed and will be published no later than Monday, March 16.
Bowles Hall, International House (I-House), co-ops, fraternities and sororities, private apartments and other housing facilities not owned by the campus have their own housing policies. Please contact your building/house manager for details. In the event your current housing will close down and you do not have other options or would prefer to stay in Berkeley, please contact Cal Housing for assistance in securing a university housing contract.

Depending on the guidance and direction of public health officials regarding COVID-19 in the coming weeks, it is possible that the campus may generally resume in-person instruction at some point during the semester. If in-person instruction resumes, in-person course attendance will continue to not be mandatory for the rest of the semester. Students who are able to make a decision now to finish this semester remotely are welcome to do so.

We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. Supervisors are encouraged to explore work assignments that these students could perform remotely over a number of weeks. If such arrangements cannot be worked out, under UC systemwide policy, students may receive two weeks of paid administrative leave. Many students work a few hours a week, so such a leave could cover many weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.

Despite this decision regarding instruction, critical campus functions, including our research enterprise and student support services, remain operational, some with adjusted service hours. We will rely on individual units to communicate any changes with your constituents. We have advised that managers and supervisors offer flexible work arrangements for employees when possible, yet we recognize that many of our operations require employees to be on campus.

Currently there are no positive cases of COVID-19 related to any members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated University Health Services professionals and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely.

Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “flatten the curve,” and slow the spread of COVID-19, respect those around you in accordance with our Principles of Community, stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus, and be well.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/13/uc-berkeley-extends-remote-instruction-through-end-of-semester/
658,Berkeley,12-Mar-20,"In our prior message, we reiterated the encouragement to make arrangements for your employees to work remotely, but our message was not clear enough. In order to increase social distancing in the workplace, managers and supervisors must proactively work with their employees, including student employees, to develop plans for most employees to work remotely.

The campus is still open but in order for us to shift more quickly to alternative work arrangements, you should begin entering into Temporary Remote Work Agreements immediately.

Alternative Work Arrangements
For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented,\ and student workers), managers and employees should work together to develop a remote work plan to complete special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training. In developing a remote work plan, managers should be mindful of employees who may not have internet access. Some training recommendations are included at the end of this message.

As a reminder, our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to report to work.

Flexible Scheduling
Subject to the needs of the University, managers should consider flexible work arrangements such as having employees work on-site with reduced shifts (fewer hours or fewer days). This can be coupled with remote work assignments for the time not spent on-site.

Use of Sick Leave and Paid Administrative Leave
For specific guidance on the use of sick leave and paid administrative leave please refer to the guidance provided by the UC Office of the President. For assistance in applying the guidance to specific situations, please consult with the Academic Personnel Office, your Regional HR Manager or People & Culture.

Next steps
We appreciate the burden that these significant operational changes place on our employees and thank you in advance for your cooperation. Your flexibility and support are indispensable as we move forward together as a community. Please contact the Academic Personnel Office, your Regional HR managers or People & Culture for assistance in managing any employment-related issues.

Training, learning and development recommendations
As part of developing a remote work plan, managers should work with their employees to identify opportunities for both training and learning & development. The top training priority is the mandatory compliance training, which includes Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training for managers and supervisors and for staff, Ethics and Cybersecurity training. The next priority for the campus community is Unconscious Bias Training.

For learning & development, all employees, especially managers and supervisors, should consider completing the online management program, Grow Today. This fully online workshop series is designed for all staff, from seasoned people leaders to those desiring to become a manager, supervisor, or team lead. It includes the core curriculum of the UC People Management Certificate and the full curriculum for the UC Implicit Bias Certificate.

You can also take this time to prepare to ‘Achieve Together’ (our new Performance Management program) by visiting our updated website, which now includes FAQs, program guides and employee training. You can also check out our online learning opportunities for both individual contributors and managers/supervisors.

We also recommend checking out our transferable skills library. This provides curated learning paths from our partners at LinkedIn Learning, which is another source of development opportunities that all members of our UC Berkeley community can access.

Alternative work arrangements
We continue to encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all employees, including student employees, in caring for their health – and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 – while still enabling them to continue to perform the important work they do. Our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences.

642,Berkeley,9-Mar-20,"Today I am announcing new campus actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. There are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time; however, as local, national, and global public health recommendations shift to include mitigation of transmission, the campus is proactively taking steps that will help to protect the community.

For more
The latest information on the campus response can be found on the coronavirus information page.

A more detailed version of this memo is also available.

These changes are effective starting Tuesday, March 10, and will remain in place through Spring Break, which ends March 29. A decision on what will happen on March 30 and beyond will occur at a later date, based on the latest coronavirus information at that time.

Instruction
Beginning Tuesday, March 10, we will be suspending most in-person classes and will be offering ALL lecture courses (including discussion sections), seminar instruction and examination through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom, course capture, etc.) through Spring Break.
Instructors who do not have remote learning processes in place by March 10 will be given a two-day period (March 10 and 11) during which they may cancel classes, to allow them time to establish such processes and to ready their course(s) for resumption online by Thursday, March 12. Students, please look for communications from instructors about plans for individual courses.
Courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate will continue to meet in person. For the time being, this will include all laboratory, performing arts, and physical education courses, although they are encouraged to minimize in-person meetings as appropriate.
Events
All campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 150 attendees will be canceled or postponed. These include events put on by the administration or an academic department and scheduled to take place through March 29. This does not include events scheduled by Cal Performances or Intercollegiate Athletics; however, those events should include generous refund policies for anyone who wishes not to attend for any reason. Guidance will be forthcoming regarding registered student organization events.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 150 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
Campus Operations
The campus is not closing. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations will proceed normally, including student housing and dining and research support operations. Please note, however, that there may be some limitations in operations and services as managers will be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided soon.
More detailed information on these matters is posted on the campus’s coronavirus information website. Additional details, and the most up-to-date news, for students and instructors pertaining to instruction will be posted on the Instructional Resilience Resources page.

We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice will have broad impacts and will be challenging and disruptive for many of you, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. We are grateful to the staff throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts on our behalf during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles. Your work is critically important at this time and we greatly value you and your contributions.

In our assessment of the current situation, including the likelihood that the Berkeley campus could have a coronavirus case here at any time, we believe that this is the best action for our campus community and the broader Berkeley community.

We will continue to update you on this issue with information posted on the new coronavirus information website. Information on the virus and related health and safety information is available on the special University Health Services website.

While there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus, we know that there are confirmed cases in neighboring areas, and it could very well happen on the Berkeley campus at any time. Consequently, we want to be as prepared and ready as possible, so that we can move quickly should we need to.

You may have seen the memo to instructors advising that they begin planning more ways to offer their course content and lectures outside of the classroom, predominantly online. We have also encouraged supervisors and managers to, where possible, allow employees to work from home. These are baseline measures that we would ramp up quickly, and perhaps broadly across campus, if circumstances warrant such actions.

Today we are calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that in the near future we will need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually as much as possible.

Campus events and activities are proceeding as planned right now, and in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no local guidance to limit events, but we stand prepared to take such action if and when needed.

Any campus decision to take broad actions, such as ending all classroom instruction or eliminating large events on campus, would be made in consultation with local public health authorities and the University of California Office of the President.

While some other universities in California and elsewhere may have taken more far-reaching actions, such as ending all classroom instruction and turning solely to remote learning, they take such actions in consultation with their local health officials, informed by the number of cases and community spread in their local area.

This situation is very fluid, and it could change very quickly in the Berkeley area, requiring, again, that we change course at a moment’s notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on the virus itself and other health information posted on the UHS website. For the latest information about campus actions and campus operations visit our coronavirus information platform that launched today.

Although anyone could suffer from coronavirus exposure, we also recognize that some are especially vulnerable, including older persons, and those with significant underlying health conditions.

Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.

1469,Berkeley,6-Mar-20,"Here are a few excerpts, edited for length, from the AMA:

Question from Akhenatenaten: What will the administration do to ensure an equal academic opportunity to succeed for those who acquire the virus? How will they proceed, sooner rather than later, to protect all students equally from coronavirus?
For more
The latest information on the campus response can be found on the coronavirus information page.

Paul Alivisatos, executive vice chancellor and provost: There are many protocols that we have or are putting in place to protect our community, and they touch nearly every aspect of the campus. We are encouraging instructors to move classes online and facilitating this change. We are asking instructors to relax attendance rules. We are building guidelines for student travel. We are developing telecommuting guidelines for staff. We are weighing whether to hold large events on campus, with guidance from local health authorities. RSSP is creating contingency plans for what will happen if and when a campus community member tests positive for coronavirus. We have and will continue to communicate these issues in regular emails about the situation. Up-to-date information is also available here.

Ella Callow, director, disability access & compliance chief: Disabled students have a right to be safe and healthy, and get their education. The tools are in place right now to help facilitate this. If going to class is a risk for you due to coronavirus, go to your Disabled Students’ Program Specialist. Talk to them about amending your Letter of Accommodation to include that the class must be made accessible to you through the use of the Instructional Resilience resources available to professors and GSIs. If you haven’t used DSP services yet, go online and check them out here.

Question from 127-0-0-1_1: Will the administration enforce policies that allow people who highly suspect they have coronavirus to avoid large events without objectively harming their grade?
Guy Nicolette, assistant vice chancellor for University Health Services: If you highly suspect you have the virus — i.e. you have fever or cough/difficulty breathing and you have traveled to any area with sustained transmission within the two weeks before symptoms start or you have had contact with a proven case — you should call your healthcare provider (for faculty/staff) or the UHS Advice Line (for students) at 510-643-7197 immediately for advice. This does not necessarily mean you have the virus, but you should put on a mask and get assessed as soon as possible. Strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for coronavirus; these are updated regularly as the situation evolves.

Callow: The Cal messages that were sent out on March 2 and March 4 from the Provost and Chair of the Academic Senate address some of your concerns.

Question from sprucegoose11: Are there protocols being developed to deep-clean and disinfect classrooms, public spaces, campus shuttles to mitigate the spread of the virus?
Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration: The campus has indeed enhanced disinfection and cleaning procedures for common areas. We have expanded our day service to clean and disinfect touch points in public areas, restrooms, and entrances, (ie. door knobs, elevator buttons, water fountains).

We have installed hand sanitizer dispensing stations in high-traffic visible areas across campus, and especially entrances to buildings, though we want to underscore that frequent hand-washing can be more effective than hand sanitizing. We will also be expanding our regular custodial coverage from weekly to daily in classrooms, labs, and conference areas.

Question from sprucegoose11: Will our Student Health Insurance Plan cover testing costs for the virus? Will the Tang center be testing students?
Nicolette: There is no cost to students for testing of those people that meet the CDC criteria for testing. Call the UHS Advice Line at 510-643-7197 if you believe you might have this illness, and we will help guide the next steps. Faculty/staff need to contact their healthcare provider, unless they believe they were infected in the course of their required duties at UCN (e.g. healthcare providers, UCPD), in which case they can also contact Occupational Health at 510-642-6891.

Question from sprucegoose11: Does campus administration advise against traveling over spring break?
Fisher: We are recommending students follow the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Department of State recommendations for personal travel. CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. Aside from any risk from coronavirus itself, the transportation bans and infrastructure disruption are significant. It is also possible that U.S. borders might close to re-entry from some areas, making it challenging to return.

Steve Sutton, vice chancellor for student affairs: There will soon be a short spring break travel survey from the Division of Student Affairs that will help us understand students’ spring break travel plans. We encourage students who receive an email invitation to please fill out this form, as it helps the campus better prepare. Cal Dining will be providing service over Spring Break for students who remain on campus. There will be service at the Crossroads location Sunday, March 22 through Saturday, March 28, with hours of service to include brunch 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and dinner 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Questions from neuralsurfer2000: Why hasn’t UC Berkeley already taken strong action in the form of cancelling classes/shifting them to all online?
Oliver O’Reilly, chair, Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate: Our goal and hope is to be able to continue instruction, modified as necessary. We are actively recommending that faculty use technology to accommodate students and to discourage sick students from coming to campus. To date, many departments have been adopting the recommendations, however we are aware that some have not – I shared a message with department chairs last night to strongly encourage they do so.

Should the public health officials advise the campus community to limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other, faculty who adopted the recommendations will enable the campus to maintain instructional continuity and ensure that students will continue to make academic progress. Instructors who haven’t adopted the recommendations will be in a very difficult position and may be unable to continue teaching their courses. This will put their students in an even more challenging position and will put the faculty member at odds with their responsibilities.

Question from sharksuki: What conditions have to be met for you to justifiably (by your definition) cancel classes?
Alivisatos: We are monitoring conditions on campus and in very close contact with the CDC and local public health officials (Berkeley Public Health and others). We would use their expert guidance, as well as consultation with the UC Office of the President, to make a decision like this. It is likely we would require all classes to move online before making the decision to cancel them.

Questions from pm-me-historyfacts: Given the high density of people in the dorms, it’s possible that just a few people could infect huge numbers of people. What is the administration doing to be proactive in high risk situations like this?
Sutton: We are currently bringing in an existing outside vendor to provide deep cleaning services for dorms and other spaces. I responded more fully to this above, but Residential Student Service Programs has plans in place to move students who are confirmed to have COVID-19 to isolation spaces (with beds, showers, kitchenette) and to have food delivered to them. If experts believe that multiple people within a dorm/floor have been exposed, we plan on quarantining floors and again providing food delivery.

Questions from pm-me-historyfacts: What is the recommendation on travel outside the U.S.? In the case that students are stuck in other countries, what can they do?
Fisher: Our recommendation is to follow CDC guidance, which currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. The CDC is advising social distancing strategies, including staying home for 14 days, for individuals returning from these countries. Please check the travel guidance on our website for more info here.

Question from usernoob23: What are you actually doing to help mitigate the effect once it reaches UC Berkeley?
Nicolette: We have already amended our triage processes (online and nurse-staffed) to enhance our ability to take care of as many people as possible while minimizing the risk of exposure to others, and we will do so further should there be a case on campus. UHS operations are planning to convert to a higher volume mass assessment model should we face an outbreak situation, changing our appointment model, separating patient flow, and potentially conducting triage outside the building.

We are setting up contracts with temp agencies to provide additional staff and have been preparing for adapted use of medical equipment to make it stretch further, in alignment with CDC guidance. We are also preparing our mental health staff to be better able to support our students, and our occupational health and employee assistance programs to do the same for faculty/staff.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/06/ask-me-anything-berkeley-campus-officials-answer-reddit-questions-about-coronavirsu/
312,Berkeley,6-Mar-20,"As concerns over the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak intensify at the local, national, and international levels, incidents of xenophobia and anti-Asian racism, harassment, and bullying on campus also have increased. These behaviors have no place at UC Berkeley.

While we should exercise caution against infection from coronavirus, we also should stand firm in rejecting all forms of anti-Asian sentiment and other xenophobia in the guise of fear of COVID-19.

The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans notes, “While the coronavirus represents a legitimate public health concern, it is not a ‘green light’ to target Asian Americans and Asian immigrants with racism and hate.”

As reflected in our campus Principles of Community, we must remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our campus community, regardless of race or country of origin, feel welcome, safe, and respected.

UC Berkeley prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation/identity and/or sexual violence status. If you have experienced physical assaults, hate crimes, and/or threats of violence, you have the right to report them to UCPD and the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD). Concerns about hateful incidents or messages also can be made via stophate.berkeley.edu, our systemwide portal for making those reports.

As a reminder, people should not come to work if they feel ill. In addition, vulnerable populations, including older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions, should strongly consider ways to work remotely and limit exposure to the larger campus community.

Alternative Work Arrangements
We are encouraging all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all their employees in caring for their health — and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 — while still enabling them to continue to perform the important work they do.

One effective strategy for minimizing the spread of COVID-19 is greater “social distancing” through alternative work arrangements. In situations where work can temporarily be performed from home or an alternate location, we encourage managers and employees to work together to identify opportunities to allow employees to work remotely (telecommute). If alternative work arrangements are not a possibility, employees should continue to come to work as usual, unless the situation changes.

Social distancing can also be accomplished by using technology (Zoom or teleconferencing) to reduce the number of meetings involving large numbers of people.

Represented employees and student workers
Please be mindful that hourly, represented, and student workers may have different levels of job flexibility; hence, please take that into account in your strategy and responses.

Resources
For guidance on working remotely, please visit the Telecommunications Policy Website. For managers seeking additional guidance on how to manage remote workers, we encourage you to take advantage of our LinkedIn Learning resources. Technology-related guidance and resources for telecommuting are available on the Technology Resources page.

Please contact Regional HR managers or People & Culture for assistance in managing any employment-related issues.

Next steps
As we continue to work through the uncertainty caused by the spread of COVID-19, we hope that we can be sensitive to each other’s needs in this situation and make accommodations when we can. Campus leaders are continuing to meet daily to think through these issues and assess options should circumstances require the campus to take broad action to reduce potential exposure.

We have every confidence in our community’s ability to pull together with kindness, care, and compassion. And we count on every member of our community to guard against the stereotyping and xenophobia that sometimes accompany disease outbreaks.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/06/uc-berkeley-staff-encouraged-to-work-remotely-to-curb-coronavirus-spread/
1342,Berkeley,6-Mar-20,"We are writing today to share with you the latest updates, policies and general guidance regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) and travel.

Please keep in mind that as we take steps to help ensure the health and safety of our community we also want to be respectful of everyone. We ask everyone to follow our Principles of Community and learn more about stigma and how to correct it with facts and information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Work-related, non-essential travel
The University of California, Office of the President (UCOP) systemwide policy limits faculty, staff and student work-related travel to impacted countries if the work is non-essential. Initially, this was for countries with a CDC risk level of 3, however, yesterday UCOP announced that it was expanding the list to Level 2 countries. We encourage everyone to view the continually updated information on travel posted on the campus Global Engagement Office website for more information.

If your business travel has been canceled as a result of the coronavirus and you were not able to obtain a full refund of some or all of your expenses, you have options for requesting reimbursement, which can vary depending on how you booked your travel. We’ve outlined these options on the travel website.

If you are still planning to travel for business and booked the travel outside of the UC Travel Portal, Connexxus, but have not yet registered the trip for travel insurance, please be sure to register immediately, as the UC provided travel insurance program will cover trip cancellation or interruption (up to $2,000) as a result of the coronavirus and medical expenses up to $500,000 when traveling outside of the U.S.

We understand that news about the virus and its spread is concerning and some individuals may be reluctant about travel — domestic or international — right now. We encourage managers and supervisors to review the CDC and UCOP guidance and direct employees with questions to that guidance as well.

Personal travel
We encourage you to follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and U.S. Department of State recommendations for travel. CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. Aside from any risk from coronavirus itself, the transportation bans and infrastructure disruption are significant. It is also possible that U.S. borders might close to re-entry from some areas, making it challenging to return.

Spring break and students
There will soon be a short spring break travel survey from the Division of Student Affairs that will help us understand more about students’ travel plans during the spring break. We encourage students who receive an email invitation to please fill out this form, as it helps the campus to better prepare.

Cal Dining will be providing service over spring break for students who remain on campus. There will be service at the Crossroads location Sunday, March 22 through Saturday, March 28, with hours of service to include brunch 10am-4pm and dinner 5pm-8pm.

Study Abroad
There are no campus-based study-abroad programs operating in the spring semester through the Berkeley Study Abroad office. The system-wide, UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) has canceled its spring and summer programs in China, as well as its spring programs in South Korea and Italy.

UCEAP is working with staff and partners in Italy and South Korea, UCOP and the nine UC campuses to assist students who are currently in those two countries. Students and their parents have received instructions for activating the Trip Interruption Benefit of the UCEAP travel insurance for early departure. UCEAP is coordinating additional financial assistance for travel home and academic support as needed.

As Department of State and CDC updates are released, UCEAP will make decisions about programs in other countries. Likewise, campus-based summer abroad programs managed by the Berkeley Study Abroad office will also rely on Department of State and CDC updates.

International students unable to travel home this summer
We are aware that world events may cause some international students to choose not to return to their home this coming summer. To assist students who may not have summer housing in place, Cal Housing is encouraging these students to register for housing for the 12-week summer session (Session AD). Please visit the Cal Housing website for details. Please note that summer housing stock is limited.

For those students who choose to remain in Berkeley for the summer, Berkeley Summer Sessions offers options that can help keep their academics on track or allow them to gain a new credential.

If you are unclear as to how any of these choices may or may not impact your non-immigrant status you are encouraged to contact the Berkeley International Office.

Guidance to students, faculty, postdocs, staff and visiting scholars and students, regarding travel to campus from impacted countries to work or study at UC Berkeley.
Students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, student researchers and postdocs traveling to campus from mainland China after February 2, 2020 will, per California Dept of Public Health (CDPH) guidance, be screened and quarantined for 14 days after their return with close monitoring by their local public health department.

CDC now also recommends that individuals with a recent travel history from all countries/areas with widespread, ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice countries) stay home for 14 days from the time you left and practice social distancing.The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) echoed this guidance in a directive issued yesterday, stating that such individuals must self-isolate for 14 days.

All UC Berkeley faculty, staff, students, postdocs and other UC affiliates including visiting scholars are asked to call the University Health Services COVID-19 Travel Line at 510-642-6622 upon arrival in the Bay Area. All impacted international visiting scholars, visiting student researchers and postdocs should also contact the Berkeley International Office to ensure that U.S. Department of Homeland Security SEVIS arrival reporting requirements are met and should also notify their host department of their arrival and/or any delays to the start of their program/stay.

CDC guidance instructs individuals traveling from the impacted areas as noted above to:

Stay home and avoid contact with others; not to go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.

Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.
Avoid crowded places (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in public.
Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).
Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.
If you get sick with fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), cough, or have trouble breathing:
Seek medical care. Call ahead before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room. For students ONLY: call the UHS Advice Line (24/7) at (510) 643-7197.
Tell your doctor about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others, and wear a paper mask, if you have one
If you need to seek medical care for other reasons, such as dialysis, call ahead to your doctor and tell them about your recent travel to an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of COVID-19.
Additional resources
We encourage everyone to view the helpful resource information, including tips on proper hygiene such as lathering your hands and washing for at least 20 seconds, as well as mental health resources, on the UHS website. For COVID-19 travel-related questions, UHS has set up an advice line. Please call 510-642-6622 during business hours.

These are trying times, so we encourage everyone to take care of themselves and be sensitive to the needs of those around you.

The situation regarding coronavirus (COVID-19) is dynamic and consequently guidance from public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changes frequently. Please review the content on the COVID-19 campus website regularly.

746,Berkeley,4-Mar-20,"We write in follow up to our March 2 message to all instructors regarding planning ahead for instructional resilience. In light of the news yesterday that there is now a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Berkeley, we are providing the following guidance to instructors on holding courses and exams. We are providing this guidance as a precautionary measure, so that students who feel unwell do not feel compelled to attend lectures or take examinations while they are ill.

Instructional guidance
Instructors are asked to review and implement the following instructional guidance:

Holding Classes: In-person classes should continue to be held until advised otherwise. Additionally, instructors are asked, whenever feasible, to offer an online option for their course lecture material (see #2 and #3 below). Instructors who are unwell are asked, as is standard practice, to make arrangements to have their course covered.
Course Capture (Screen Capture with Audio Recording – No Video of Instructor): For classes offered in rooms that are equipped and are not currently using course capture, we are asking for instructors to use the free Screen with Audio Recording option so that students can participate remotely. Email coursecapture@berkeley.edu with your course name to activate this option.
Alternate Means of Recording Classes: For classes offered in rooms where free Course Capture is not available, instructors are encouraged to:
use ZoomPro and a laptop to record lecture slides/audio where strong internet connection is available and share after class through bCourses; or
record audio from your phone/tablet/laptop and share audio file and slide deck through bCourses as separate files; and
share a text version through bCourses.
Attendance Requirements: We are asking instructors to consider suspending any attendance requirements until further notice.
Office Hours: We are asking instructors to consider enabling video conferencing for office hours.
Exams: For examinations during the month of March, we encourage instructors to give take-home exams that are returned to the instructor using the bCourses Quizzes or Assignments functionality. Instructors should accommodate students who are ill.
Labs: Labs should remain open and routine safety measures should continue to be adhered to.
Course Activities and Physical Contact: We recommend instructors consider a no physical contact policy for course activities (e.g., for courses in the departments such as Theatre, Dance and Performing Studies, Physical Education, Maker Spaces, etc.). Additionally, staff, instructors, and students are strongly encouraged to properly clean contact surfaces and equipment before and after use. Facilities Services has also been asked to increase their cleaning services during this period.
Resources
Schedule a virtual or in-person consultation with a DLS consultant for support in using digital methods for teaching. Please feel free to bring a GSI or other member of your teaching staff with you. Drop in consultation services will also be offered in the Academic Innovation Studio (117 Dwinelle) from 9am to 4pm Monday through Friday.
Terry Johnson, Faculty Director of the CTL, will hold a workshop on pedagogical approaches to disruption on Thursday, March 5, from 4:45 p.m.  to 6:00 p.m. To accommodate schedules and capacity an additional, identical workshop will be held the following week. You can attend in person at the Academic Innovation Studio or via Zoom.
Visit the Instructional Resilience Resources page for links to resources, best practices, support, and training materials. Here you will also learn how to access a free ZoomPro account, which allows instructors to offer audio and video streaming for up to 300 participants and sessions lasting up to 24 hours. Instructors offering courses with extremely different needs – from small group seminars to large lectures – have successfully used ZoomPro. Staff are currently on standby anticipating requests from instructors for these accounts.
Please note that a detailed list of accommodations can be found on the Academic Accommodations Hub. An updated set of guidelines for missed days of instruction has also been issued by the Academic Senate.
Instructors who have questions or concerns about implementing our recommendations, please elevate them to your chair for guidance. For issues that are not resolvable at the local level, chairs are encouraged to contact their deans. Should you have other issues that we have not addressed or ideas that might benefit the instructional mission of the campus during these times, please feel free to let us know by sending an email to vcue@berkeley.edu. We will do our utmost to respond in a timely manner.

482,Berkeley,3-Mar-20,"Local public health officials have confirmed today one case of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Berkeley. The individual is not affiliated with the campus and, at this time, there is no obvious connection.

The individual is in good condition and is isolating at home. This was a travel-related transmission of the virus, not a local community transmission, according to public health authorities.

For more updates
The latest information on how UC Berkeley is responding to coronavirus

We understand that news of a confirmed case within the city of Berkeley is unsettling. Please keep in mind that the risk to anyone in the general U.S. population remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Precautions
We remind the campus community to take appropriate precautions. Please call your healthcare provider or the University Health Services (UHS) Advice Line for students at (510) 643-7197 immediately if both of the following are true:

You have a fever (>100.3F if measured) or cough/difficulty breathing AND
Travel to any area with sustained transmission within the 2 weeks before symptoms start or contact with a proven case of coronavirus.
This does NOT necessarily mean you have the coronavirus but it means you should put on a mask and get assessed ASAP; if you have the flu UHS can also offer treatment.

The best protection is thorough and frequent hand washing, lathering for at least 20 seconds (hand sanitizer works too), avoiding touching your face, and vaccination for the flu — it’s still here. Keep your work areas and door knobs clean. If you feel ill, stay home.



Regarding masks, while formally fitted N95 masks are required for healthcare providers and personnel assessing or transporting a possible case of COVID-19, they are NOT recommended for the general public. They are not necessary and it is critical to preserve these supplies.

Testing guidelines
Please note that strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for this coronavirus and each test needs to be approved by the public health officer. While each case is evaluated separately, and this may change, UHS and other health clinics are generally NOT currently testing people without a relevant travel history, unless they are severely ill and need to be hospitalized.

Campus support / Health and safety efforts
We understand that this news of a local case can be concerning and result in feelings of anxiousness. For additional information, please continue to visit the University Health Services web pages that contain an FAQ, a video with basic information about the virus, and information about mental health resources.



Campus leaders continue to meet regularly to address prevention and response efforts, which include operations. For example, we are ensuring the safety of the campus environment through measures such as expanded distribution and placement of hand sanitizers and enhanced disinfection and cleaning procedures of common areas.

We will continue to keep the campus updated.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/03/city-of-berkeley-coronavirus-case-not-linked-to-uc-berkeley/
752,Berkeley,2-Mar-20,"A. Paul Alivisatos, UC Berkeley’s executive vice chancellor and provost, and Oliver M. O’Reilly, chair of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, sent the following message to all all faculty, instructors and graduate student instructors on Monday, March 2:

We write to let you know that as of today, Monday March 2, there is no reported case of COVID-19 on the Berkeley campus and a single reported case in Alameda County. In the interests of health and safety, this is an appropriate time for all instructors (e.g., faculty, graduate student instructors, lecturers, etc.) to be prepared in the event that some students, staff, or instructors become ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months, or in the event that the campus needs to temporarily suspend in-person instruction.



As a community we must do our utmost in these challenging times to ensure that our students receive the quality of education they deserve and continue progress towards their academic goals. We also wish to remind instructors that they should accommodate and not penalize students who become ill or are quarantined. We are also committed to protecting the health and safety of our students and our teaching community.

In responses to the disruptions caused by PG&E outages and air quality issues in the recent past, a Task Force for Instructional Resilience was charged in the late Fall to address continuity during times when courses cannot be held on campus as planned. The following recommendations, which we strongly encourage you to consider applying to your courses, have been generated through listening sessions with the campus community, a campus wide survey with 290 responses and hours of task force discussions and working group meetings:

The Center for Teaching & Learning and Digital Learning Services has excellent resources for booking consultations and accessing training materials – including specific training and support on Zoom and bCourses. Here you will also learn how to access a free ZoomPro account which allows instructors to offer courses for up to 24 hours and 300 participants. Staff are currently on standby anticipating requests from instructors for these accounts. If your class has over 300 students email digitallearning@berkeley.edu and staff will assist you. Terry Johnson will hold a workshop at AIS on Thursday March 5 from 4:45pm-6:00pm on Instructional Resilience. The workshop can also be access ed remotely using Zoom. Staff are eager to assist faculty who may not yet be familiar with this technology.
Best practices and preparation checklists for both instructors and students to help prepare for disruptions have been posted on the Instructional Resilience Resources page at teaching.berkeley.edu. We strongly encourage instructors to also review the guidelines for students, so they can anticipate students’ questions and concerns.
Instructors should ensure that they have access to the gradebooks for all of the sections of the classes for which they are instructors of record. For ease of access, instructors are strongly encouraged to use the gradebook facility in bCourses. This will provide back up should an instructor/GSI fall ill. We also advise that the instructor of record consider delegating access to the bCourses gradebook to their department chair.
Provisions should also be made with an instructor’s department so that an alternate instructor or graduate student instructor is on standby should the instructor or graduate student instructor become ill or quarantined and unable to teach.
Instructors are encouraged to consider assessments and exams that accommodate student illness and possible lack of access to campus. Provisions should also be put in place so that the final exam can be administered and graded should the instructor become ill or placed under quarantine.
The Academic Senate’s Committee on Courses and Instruction (COCI) has issued guidelines for single-incident disruption of classes to assist in managing reduced days of instruction.
Should local public health officials advise that we limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other, we believe the preliminary recommendations and information provided above will help you plan ahead. The task force will continue to develop recommendations and work with the campus to develop resources that will support instructional resilience into the future.

We realize these are times of uncertainty and concern and we thank you for your patience and wisdom in navigating these challenges. For the sake of our students and staff, it is important that we are as prepared as possible all the while hoping that our precautions will prove to be unnecessary. Should you have any ideas or concerns please feel free to share them with the Instructional Resilience Task Force by emailing vcue@berkeley.edu We will do our utmost to respond in a timely manner and adopt your ideas if we believe they will be effective.

436,Berkeley,2-Mar-20,"As you may have learned over the weekend, public health officials have announced that there is a confirmed case of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) involving an Alameda County resident. It is linked to the recent case in Solano County and does not represent local transmission.

At this time, we have no confirmed cases of the virus on campus and we continue to take appropriate actions to prepare for any possible case here. Above all, we are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our campus community. We understand and empathize with the anxiety many are feeling about the novel coronavirus and we are committed to providing regular updates.

For more updates
The latest information on how UC Berkeley is responding to coronavirus

Today, campus officials have activated our Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which will allow for operational leaders from across campus units to meet, share information and develop contingency plans in a more efficient and coordinated manner. This is in addition to the ongoing meetings of senior campus leadership (the Crisis Management Team) that began two months ago. Campus health officials are in close contact with and will continue to take guidance from local public health officials at the city, county, state, and federal levels. The UC Office of the President provides additional operational guidance.

Other developments regarding the virus include an expansion of countries that now have travel advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. We encourage everyone to view the continually updated information on travel which is posted on the campus Global Engagement website.



We encourage students to review this preparation checklist to help with planning for possible disruptions to instruction. This includes guidance such as asking instructors what their plans are for disruptions and being ready to engage more heavily via bCourses, Zoom or other alternate instructional tools. Campus academic leadership sent a message to instructors today advising them to make preparations in the event in-person instruction is disrupted.

Please continue to visit the University Health Services web page for the latest and more detailed information regarding the virus, campus actions and general tips on how to stay safe.

Meanwhile, we continue to remind you to wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, cover and contain any coughs into a tissue or your sleeve, avoid touching your face, and please stay home if you feel sick.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/02/coronavirus-update-still-no-confirmed-cases-at-uc-berkeley/
802,Berkeley,28-Feb-20,"There have been a number of new and significant developments regarding the novel coronavirus(COVID-19), consequently we are writing to you today to share the latest information and guidance with you.

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the virus on campus or in Alameda County. We remain vigilant in our campus prevention and response efforts, which have been underway for months now, and are ready to take prompt and effective action should a case occur here.

Recent developments regarding the virus include the announcement by public health officials this week of a new and troubling confirmed coronavirus case in Solano County; news of notable spread of the disease in more countries; and a warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that Americans should expect to see more cases here including the possibility of the virus spreading in some communities.  To prepare, local officials should review their pandemic plans, and everyone should follow the standard protocols of washing their hands frequently, not touching their face and staying home if sick.

Please keep in mind that while the potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States, the CDC states that the risk to the general American public, which is unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, is considered low. Still, we realize that this is a difficult time and we encourage the entire campus community to look out for one another.

New case in Solano county
The CDC and public health officials have announced that the new confirmed case in Solano County involves an individual who has not traveled to the impacted countries and has had no known contact with individuals with the virus. The individual is being treated at the UC Davis Medical Center.

Because this case is not connected with travel, it suggests that the virus may now be present in the U.S. community. As a result, public health professionals have today updated protocols for determining the criteria for testing individuals, have bolstered testing capacity at state and local laboratories, and are updating travel and other guidance daily.



On the Berkeley campus, we are proactively engaged in pandemic planning in collaboration with our public health partners: this includes everything from intentional use and preservation of essential medical supplies and staffing resources, to enhancing protocols and coordinating efforts to isolate sick and quarantine at-risk individuals. This is in addition to ongoing efforts that include campus leaders meeting at least weekly to develop and review plans regarding best practices such as where and how to house individuals if a case occurs; how to ensure we will meet teaching obligations if there are a number of cases on campus; and how to assist and support international students, researchers and other potentially impacted members of our campus community.

Campus officials are also working in coordination with the University of California, Office of the President, which activated its Emergency Operations Center many weeks ago and continues to hold regular conference calls including medical, environmental health and safety, administrative, and emergency management leadership from across the UC system.

Spread of the disease in more countries
There have been a number of news reports of the virus’s growing impact in other countries including Italy and South Korea. UC President Janet Napolitano recently updated her systemwide directive regarding travel to advise the UC community to temporarily avoid all nonessential travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Travel Warning – Level 3 Notice (avoid nonessential travel). Note that the CDC travel warning is distinct from the State Department travel advisories.  The systemwide directive currently includes South Korea as well as China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Macau an d Hong Kong).



We would in addition strongly recommend that everyone carefully review both the CDC website and the State Department website in planning for upcoming personal travel: additional hot spots are likely to emerge and in addition to the risk of exposure while abroad, there is a risk that border controls similar to those currently in place for China may be put in place by the U.S. Government and it could be challenging to return.

The Berkeley campus has a process in place by which members of the campus community may seek exemptions for university-related travel. We also encourage everyone who travels, whether for university business or for personal travel, to register with the campus travel service, which provides additional protections and safety measures.



Please continue to refer to the University Health Services’ advisory page, which is updated weekly or more frequently when needed.  Significant campus updates will be communicated through Cal Message and other means, as appropriate

And, once again, please continue to take care of yourselves and look out for each other as we work our way through these difficult times.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/02/28/how-uc-berkeley-is-responding-to-new-coronavirus-developments/
332,Berkeley,31-Jan-20,"News regarding the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues to evolve and we are writing today to keep you informed of the latest information from public health officials, governmental entities and others.

We learned today that there is one confirmed case of coronavirus in Santa Clara County. Currently, there remains no confirmed cases in Alameda County. And, as you are aware, there are a number of other cases in the United States and thousands in China.

[Earlier: How UC Berkeley is preparing for coronavirus]

Regarding travel, the State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory (do not travel) for China and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to China. University of California President Janet Napolitano issued a directive Thursday requiring that UC limit non-essential UC-related travel to China.

At UC Berkeley we are establishing local travel protocols to carry out the new UCOP travel directive. Please send any requests for essential UC-related travel to China to our Global Engagement Office (geo@berkeley.edu) for review and approval.

For the latest information and more details about recent developments please continue to view the UHS Health Advisory. We also strongly encourage all members of the campus community to register with the campus travel insurance program for both personal and professional travel as doing so provides a number of measures to help ensure your safety.

While the CDC informs us that the risk of the virus to the U.S. general population is low, we understand that these can be anxious and stressful times. We encourage all members of the campus community to support each other, look out for each other, and keep in mind our Principles of Community. Remember, we are in flu season, so coming in contact with someone with a cough or fever does not necessarily indicate that they have coronavirus. Be mindful of your assumptions about others.

We will send another coronavirus update soon, meanwhile please continue to check the UHS website and news.berkeley.edu for updates.",https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/01/31/as-coronavirus-arrives-in-bay-area-uc-berkeley-prepares/
503,Berkeley,28-Jan-20,"We are writing to provide an update on the coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and campus response and preparedness efforts.

University Health Services (UHS),working in partnership with local public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), continues to monitor the situation closely and take steps to help ensure the health and safety of the campus community.

There are several cases in the United States, including one in Santa Clara County and a few in Southern California. Most of the infections, thousands at this point, have occurred in China, including outside Wuhan, China.

While this coronavirus is understandably causing worry and anxiety, particularly in those returning from or with family in affected areas in China, the CDC currently believes the risk of the virus to the U.S. general public is low.

On campus, we are following all health protocols prescribed by the CDC and reinforced by state, county and city health officials. The CDC does not currently recommend isolation of travelers returning from affected areas if they do not have symptoms.  And as a community, we should be aware that this is an especially difficult time for Chinese students with family in the Wuhan area. To support the well-being of our students and the campus community, information and support resources may be helpful.

For individuals who recently returned from Wuhan, China please see our FAQ  for the latest health recommendations.

University Health Services officials have set up screening procedures for individuals who come to the Tang Center who are at high risk and are showing symptoms. Such individuals are moved immediately into a private room and evaluated in coordination with the public health department to see if they meet CDC criteria for testing and isolation. Senior campus leaders have been meeting to oversee and to help coordinate campus preparedness and response efforts. The UC Office of the President is also working to ensure close collaboration and communication among UC campuses.

Information and precautions for the general public
The best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the flu and other respiratory viruses are to:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Stay home when you are sick; if you must be out and about, consider wearing a paper (“surgical”) mask and avoid close contact with others.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then immediately throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, cough into your sleeve (not your hands).

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Academic Information
We are encouraging instructors to support students who have been advised to stay home, by helping them meet their academic obligations through alternatives to classroom-based learning. For students and instructors, details on policies for accommodations can be found here. 

We will continue to update the UC Berkeley community regarding the coronavirus as developments occur.  Additional information can be found at the links below:

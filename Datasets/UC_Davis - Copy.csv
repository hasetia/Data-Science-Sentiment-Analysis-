31-Jan-20,Davis,"Fight it like the flu
Updated 5 p.m. Jan. 31 ? UC Davis continues to think locally and globally regarding the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and is spreading around the world.

INFLUENZA
Protecting yourself against the flu is protecting yourself from ?a real and present danger right now here at home,? UC Davis Health?s chief nursing and patient services officer, Toby Marsh, said in a memo to all staff late this afternoon (Jan. 31).

?An estimated 15 million people have been infected by the flu this season, with more than 8,000 deaths so far. In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.?

The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus ? the flu.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, ?person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.?

On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a ?very high threat? travel destination for university affiliates.

Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County?s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident ? a man ? had tested positive for the novel ? or new ? coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.

The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.

More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.

Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.

Travel advisory
With today?s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates? China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China ? and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.

Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.

Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs? COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.

Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs. 

The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.

The best defense
To help protect against flu virus ? and by extension, coronavirus ? Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.

UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.

Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: ?Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.?

Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. ?This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,? Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.

Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.

Schorzman?s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.

Human-to-human transmission
Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was ?not surprising, given what we know about the disease.?

MORE FROM UC DAVIS HEALTH
In a Jan. 24 news release and video, ?What U.S. Residents Should Know,? Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases, addresses such questions as, ?Should I wear a mask?? and ?What should I do if I have cold symptoms??
In a Jan. 22 news release and video, ?What You Should Know? (below), Blumberg addresses such questions as, ?Will the flu shot make a difference? and ?How can I avoid Wuhan coronavirus??
He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.

?That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,? Marsh said.

?It?s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.?

Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and ?determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.?

He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.

?I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,? he told staff. ?Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.?

The cap applies to all events, university-sponsored or otherwise, in all campus spaces and venues, at all UC Davis locations, and to university events held off-campus.

Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities, according to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, which recommends an attendance cap of 50 for eight weeks.

UC Davis had been operating with an attendance cap of 150, to remain in effect through spring quarter. This led to the cancellation of Picnic Day and Decision UC Davis for newly admitted freshmen and their families, among other events. The Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts has canceled all events through March 31.

Chancellor May's Thursday Thoughts - April 9, 2020

Chancellor Gary S. May's Friday coronavirus update includes his Thursday Thoughts Instagram post, above, in which he and LeShelle answer questions from the community.

To the UC Davis Community:

We continue to make hard decisions, but none of them detracts from our UC Davis mission. We continue moving forward boldly, as always  with spring quarter and Summer Sessions, vital student services, emergency veterinary care, COVID-19 health care and research, and so much more.

Unfortunately, we have had to cancel traditions, including next weekends Picnic Day, when tens of thousands of people would normally be on campus. And while the urge to celebrate may have some of you thinking, Well, maybe we can have a small party anyway  we implore you: Dont do it.

Nor should we see gatherings this holiday weekend. We are still under shelter-in-place orders, the coronavirus threat is real, please do not jeopardize your health or anyone elses.

Two days ago, in emails to students, staff and faculty, I announced we were postponing spring commencements perhaps the hardest decision of all. But we are moving forward with a virtual ceremony and are exploring options to have our graduates return in December for the real thing. They deserve it.

Picnic Day and commencement connect us to UC Davis like nothing else. But, even without the actual events, we can still connect with our favorite university   by participating in our fourth annual Give Day, from noon Friday, April 17, to 5 p.m. Saturday, April 18. And, remember, its totally online, at giveday.ucdavis.edu, so its safe to attend.

We are proceeding with Give Day, because, as I said, we are moving forward. During and after this pandemic, we still have research to do, discoveries to make and students to teach  including those who at this very moment are considering whether to say yes to coming to UC Davis in the fall. This week and next we are hosting those newly admitted students at Aggie Experience Live! our remote version of the open house known as Decision UC Davis. More than 7,000 prospective students have participated so far, and, judging by all the comments we are seeing on Facebook, they are liking what they see.

Instruction and assessment
This is Week 2 of spring quarter. Students are settling into their remote learning routines and midterms are approaching. Faculty members preparing for exams should be aware of our new Guide to Remote Assessment and Testing Options (available on the Keep Teaching website). The Center for Educational Effectiveness and Academic Technology Services created the guide to present options beyond online proctoring that promote academic integrity and equitably assess student learning in this new remote environment.

We also are announcing remote instruction will continue during Summer Sessions. Hundreds of courses will be offered, so summer will still be a good time to access high-demand classes for progress to degree. Registration opens April 27. Students can check out the Summer Sessions website for dates, courses and the rest of the information theyll need to plan and register.

Instructors should contact their departments with questions about remote summer instruction. (And, if health directives change, some in-person laboratory courses may become available for Summer Session II. Stay tuned for details.)

Regarding graduate instruction, the Davis Division of the Academic Senate this week approved changes that provide increased flexibility for late drops and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading for graduate students for spring quarter 2020. More information is provided in this letter from Jean-Pierre Delplanque, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies; and Kristin Lagattuta, chair of the Academic Senate.

Other new resources
Virtual UC Davis  As the campus has shifted to remote learning for spring quarter (and Summer Sessions as well), departments within the Division of Student Affairs have gone virtual to continue to support and empower students in ways that align with public health and safety guidelines. Our new Virtual UC Davis website offers information on the wide range of services still available to students  including Student Health and Counseling Services, Academic Assistance and Tutoring Centers, bookstore, Campus Recreation, Community Resources, Services for International Students and Scholars, Student Disability Center and Student Resources for Remote Learning.
Zoom privacy With coronavirus-created demands, we all now collectively spend much of our time on Zoom. Its use nationwide has jumped from 10 million monthly users in December to about 200 million daily users today. This week and last, weve seen a surge of concern and national media related to privacy and security on Zoom. Our campus privacy officer and chief information security officer joined forces to discuss some concerns raised by our teaching community. Their letter also introduces FAQs with resources to help you strengthen privacy and security on Zoom.
Global Teaching and Learning Resources in the age of COVID-19 helps faculty connect with others around the world and support students in becoming global thinkers and learners.
Student employees
We value our student employees, and we know, for some, their UC Davis income is vital to their ability to persist in their studies and pay for essentials such as food and rent. Yet their opportunity to keep working may be complicated amid suspended campus operations (indeed, some of them may have left Davis). They are eligible for paid administrative leave, but we also are encouraging their supervisors to think creatively about project work and other tasks the students could still perform remotely. Our Internship and Career Center is available to brainstorm ideas; call 530-752-2855 or send an email to icc@ucdavis.edu.

Mitigating the crisis
We continue to be grateful for what our health care personnel are doing in Sacramento, and what our researchers are doing on both sides of the causeway. Yesterday we learned of another patient leaving the UC Davis Medical Center after receiving treatment that included being enrolled in a clinical trial. We are collaborating with the state to quickly and significantly boost Californias testing capacity. A new web application developed here allows users to track COVID-19 cases and testing across the globe.

Researchers responded quickly Monday when the Office of Research put out a call for proposals for COVID-19-related projects and 10 of them received funding just three days later. More awards are yet to come.

As this crisis (hopefully) nears its peak, it is important for the rest of us to adhere to the CDCs guidelines: Practice social distancing, dont gather in groups. This goes for all ages. Please stay home, please limit your trips to the grocery store (and when you go, go alone).

And with warmer weather due this weekend, another reminder: If you plan to visit the Arboretum and Public Garden, or the Putah Creek Riparian Reserve, keep as much space as possible (at the very minimum 6 feet) between you and others. Some of our trails are narrower than 6 feet, so please consider going someplace else, or stay home. We cannot let down our guard.

We close this week by expressing our heartfelt appreciation again to our medical center heroes, our researchers, and all other faculty and staff supporting our continued mission.

Sincerely,

Gary S. May
Chancellor"

Thursday Thoughts: April 16, 2020

Chancellor Gary S. Mays Friday coronavirus update includes his Thursday Thoughts Instagram post, above, in which he and LeShelle answer questions from the community.

To the UC Davis Community:

Social distancing and isolation are working to flatten the coronavirus curve in California, and we are confident that our actions to suspend campus operations and move to remote instruction minimized infection in our community. We learned only yesterday (April 16) that a student living in The Sol at West Village neighborhood tested positive for COVID-19 on April 5. They have been self-isolating since they initially felt unwell and their symptoms resolved several days ago. Other residents of the complex are being notified by the property management. We are glad the student is doing well and wish them a full and speedy recovery.

I said at the beginning of this crisis, Well get through this, together. And we will. All of us are dealing with so much disruption in our personal and family lives, and yet each of us, in their own way, is contributing to our universitys continued mission. Our hospital staff is providing extraordinary care to COVID-19 patients. Our dedicated faculty are continuing to develop creative ways to teach our undergraduate and graduate students via remote instruction. Our students are making progress toward their degrees. Our staff members are taking care of everything else, as they always do only now, many of them are working from home, while others are still coming to campus to perform their vital duties in animal care, police and fire, dining, custodial, groundskeeping, maintenance and more. We appreciate everyones hard work.

Through it all, we see unwavering commitment to our shared purpose. We see hundreds of researchers dialing in to Zoom for weekly town halls with Dean Allison Brashear of the School of Medicine and Vice Chancellor Prasant Mohapatra of the Office of Research. We see faculty members connecting in a weekly forum that started yesterday, FacultyConnect, to discuss remote instruction. One of our distinguished professors, Walter Leal, has organized a public awareness symposium, Thursday, April 23, and I am honored to be delivering welcome remarks.

The College of Biological Sciences has organized a series of COVID-19 town halls, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Fridays, open to students, faculty, staff and the public. Todays program, with the colleges former dean, James Hildreth, and Dean Brashear, will be livestreamed here.

At a town hall earlier this month, experts from the School of Veterinary Medicines One Health Institute and the California National Primate Research Center presented updates on the schools COVID-19 response efforts. You can read about the town hall  and watch a recording  here.

Several COVID-19 research projects have started on the Davis and Sacramento campuses. Yesterday we reported the results of one of our two coronavirus-related clinical trials: Nearly two-thirds of severely ill patients showed improvement with the drug remdesivir in a small study involving our hospital and others in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan. We see no end to what our physicians and scientists will take on, in research and public outreach, to help in the battle against this pandemic.

Resources and other support
We see campus support units continuing to post and update online resources to help us through remote instruction during spring term. The UC Davis Library, in the first edition of a newsletter for faculty and researchers, highlighted a surprising range of online tools and resources to help with research and instruction in a variety of disciplines. Materials include films and digital music, a new app for teaching anatomy, peer-reviewed video demonstrations of lab experiments, and thousands more e-books now available through a new partnership with the HathiTrust Digital Library. Youll find all of this on the librarys coronavirus page (which also includes a Student Support and Healthy Study Environment section).

We also see no end to the compassion and care with which we are treating one another, by way of Coping as a Community webinars, WorkLife and Good Stuff newsletters, and much more to help us make it through.

Sadly, the nation is seeing an upswing in domestic violence as the pandemic wears on, attributed to social isolation and victims having to shelter in place with their abusers. Earlier this week, administrators of our various support programs sent an email to everyone in the campus community, stating, UC Davis is committed to continuing to support our students, staff and faculty who are affected by all forms of sexual violence, including relationship violence. All university support and reporting services continue to be available during the stay-in-place order, including emotional support, assistance with safety planning, and assistance with workplace, academic and housing accommodations.
They added: We are committed to providing services to our community members regardless of where they happen to be physically located during this unprecedented time. Read the complete letter, including a list of resources and contact information.

What lies ahead
Last week we announced we will maintain remote instruction through both Summer Sessions. In fact, all UC campuses will do the same. It is too soon to say what will happen beyond summer all we can do is continue to carefully monitor the rapidly evolving situation. We will reopen for on-site instruction when it is safe to do so  in coordination with federal, state and local health departments and authorities.

As with all coronavirus-related decisions, we will act only after extensive planning and review. I meet and consult with President Napolitano and the other nine UC chancellors three times each week to discuss and develop policies and plans, and I consult with my Leadership Council at least four days a week to discuss and develop solutions to the challenges that confront us. As you know, UC loves its meetings, and you can be sure they are continuing with the health and safety of our community the No. 1 priority in every discussion. (Speaking of meetings, check out this information from our campus privacy officer and chief information security officer about Zoom privacy and security, along with a set of updated FAQs.)

Heres a quick update on where we are now in the planning process:

Next week I will announce the formation of two Scenario Planning Groups that will work in tandem to prepare the campus to ramp up on-campus activities in a planful and prudent manner in line with evolving conditions and medical guidance as well as county, state and federal directives. One group, chaired by Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Ralph Hexter, will focus on instruction for the fall quarter, while the other, chaired by Vice Chancellor Kelly Ratliff of Finance, Operations and Administration, will focus on operations broadly defined.
Preparation for a range of possible scenarios is important given the uncertainties we will face. What is certain is that we want to fulfill the universitys missions of teaching, research and public service as robustly and impactfully as possible while ensuring the best possible outcomes for all members of our community.
Separately, the Office of Research has established the Research Ramp-Up/Down Task Force, or RRT, to formulate guidance for a slow-and-cautious ramp-up of the research enterprise when county and state officials relax their stay-at-home orders, or to ramp it down again should there be a resurgence of COVID-19.
Give Day and Picnic Day: All online
Our fourth annual Give Day is underway, today and tomorrow, with an emphasis on emergency funds. It normally coincides with Picnic Day, which, as you know, has been canceled and we sincerely hope our students and others will not risk getting together with friends to have their own Picnic Day. Please celebrate the day where you are sheltering in place, by enjoying archival videos and virtual events on the Virtual Picnic Day website. As Dateline writer Cody Kitaura put it so well this week: Theres only one must-visit location for Picnic Day this year, and its your couch.

Clearly, with campus operations suspended, we are having to make hard decisions about Picnic Day and commencement and other events that mean so much, especially to students. Unfortunately, this is the time we live in; this is what we must do for safety. Yes, we are doing things differently this quarter, but the important thing is this: Your education continues.

On a related note, I know some of you and your parents have been asking about the status of tuition and fees. I asked Vice Chancellor Ratliff to explain the situation  and she does so here, in a video. She shares additional information in this article in The California Aggie. As VC Ratliff points out: Your tuition and fees pay for people. People who are still working. They are faculty who are providing remote education, they are advisors and counselors who continue to serve students, and they are staff members who are maintaining our facilities and providing important student support services, such as Student Health and Counseling Services, the Internship and Career Center and the Aggie Compass Basic Needs Center. More information is available here on Student Affairs Virtual UC Davis website.

UC Davis is not closed. We continue to serve, and we all look forward to the time when everyone can return to campus.

Sincerely,

Gary S. May

Thursday Thoughts April 23, 2020

Chancellor Gary S. Mays Friday coronavirus update includes his Thursday Thoughts Instagram post, above. Chancellor May and LeShelle actually recorded this edition last Saturday, on what would have been Picnic Day, when the Mays would normally host the chancellors traditional Ice Cream Social. Instead, they prepared this video tour of the Chancellors Residence, showcasing the Aggie Room, UC Davis art and the chancellors playlist (and old-school player).

To the UC Davis Community:

This week we observed the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, and it has me thinking even more about the good work we do at UC Davis to protect the health of our land, air, water and animals, and of the 7.5 billion people who inhabit our planet.

We have been No. 1 in the nation in the GreenMetric World University Rankings for three years running, and our health system recently received an Environmental Excellence Award from Practice Greenhealth. We are equally proud of our John Muir Institute of the Environment, the SeaDoc Society, the Tahoe Environmental Research Center and so much more. Our research has slowed in this field, necessarily, but we are more than making up for it in COVID-19 research. We had no shortage of proposals for campus funding, and gave out our second and final set of awards this week.

Our Office of Research asked for proposals across all disciplines, and thats what we have in projects like Novel Bisaminoquinoline Derived Self-Delivered Nanodrug Against SARS-CoV-2, by Yuanpei Li, associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine; and Immunity Passport: New Forms of Biological Citizenship Post-COVID-19, by Cristiana Giordano, associate professor in the Department of Anthropology.

This week, our Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, in collaboration with the Center for Health and Technology and the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence, called for proposals related to the impact COVID-19 has had on health services, access, outcomes and costs.

Essential care
In Sacramento, UC Davis Health continues to do brilliant work in testing and research, and, of course, treatment. Heres a wonderful story about the festive farewell our health care team gave to a patient as she left the hospital. Beyond COVID-19, our health care team is continuing to provide essential patient care, including cancer surgeries, organ transplants and supporting the regions trauma care needs truly extraordinary in light of all that is happening. We thank our health care heroes. (The Washington Post spent a whole day here last week, and you can see a video report here, if youre a subscriber.)

Departments and students have been helping where they can, donating personal protective equipment and making face shields, for example, delivering hundreds of them this week and last to our medical center.

The Academic and Staff Assistance Program, or ASAP, which provides high quality, confidential counseling for faculty and staff at UC Davis and UC Davis Health, is offering its services virtually, and holding presentations and discussions on a number of topics, as well as drop-in support groups. For more information, call Davis ASAP, 530-752-2727, or UC Davis Health ASAP, 916-734-2727.

We have a truly outstanding team on both of our campuses and beyond, a point recognized earlier this week in a Twitter Roadblock when our coaches joined their counterparts around the country in tweeting their support for their academic and health colleagues as they take the fight to COVID-19 in our labs and hospitals. They used the hashtag #ProudToBeOnTheirTeam and if you look it up, youll see the tweets from this amazing show of support.

Face coverings
This morning, Yolo County issued an order requiring people to wear face coverings outside the home, including at work. Our groundskeepers, first responders and health care workers have already been wearing masks and face coverings at work. If you must be on campus to work, please bring your own face covering to wear. Most of you will already have them for your essential trips out of the house.

For employees who do not have suitable face coverings available for their on-campus assignments, we will have details soon about how to request them. As you might expect, orders for face coverings, including nonmedical masks, are in high demand. We have a limited supply on hand and have placed additional orders for expected delivery in June. 

The county order is effective immediately but not enforceable until 8 a.m. Monday, April 27. Please remember: Although wearing a face covering is one tool for reducing the spread of the virus, doing so is not a substitute for sheltering in place, physical distancing of at least 6 feet, and frequent hand-washing.

Planning scenarios
I told you last week about two Scenario Planning Groups that weve established to prepare the campus for a resumption of activities, subject, of course, to evolving conditions and medical guidance as well as county, state and federal directives. Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Ralph Hexter leads one of these groups, focusing on instruction for the fall quarter; while Vice Chancellor Kelly Ratliff of Finance, Operations and Administration leads the other, focusing on operations.

These groups will coordinate with the Office of Research, which has posted guidelines for ramping up research  but please note, and this is important: We are not there yet. This is preparation. We remain in Phase 1, sheltering in place in adherence to government directives, with only critical research allowed. Phase 2 allows time-sensitive research activities (with only a third of research personnel allowed on-site at any time). Phase 3 provides for a gradual restart, with two-thirds of research personnel allowed on-site at any time. In Phase 4, we would return to full research operations. (The guidelines can also be used in reverse, to ramp down research.)

The guidance includes principles that must be followed. They include the following: Protect the mental and physical health and safety of the research work force, clinical patients and human research subjects; no researcher should feel they are being compelled to work on campus or in the field during periods of shelter-at-home directives; safe practices within laboratories must be rigorously maintained, with adequate access to PPE and other safety related supplies; and the number of people in a workspace must be limited, to allow for proper social distancing.

Federal aid
You may have heard that the federal governments $2 trillion CARES Act provided direct funding to lessen the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and institutions of higher education. UC Davis expects to receive almost $34 million. Half, almost $17 million, will be used to provide direct financial support to students for increased needs related to the coronavirus. Financial Aid professionals at UC Davis and across UC are developing plans to distribute these funds to students, with the vast majority of funds expected to be awarded this quarter.

The remaining $17 million will be used to address the operational impact of COVID-19 on the campus. This level of funding, while helpful, will meet only a small portion of the campus need: Last month alone, we experienced unanticipated expenditures and losses of $80 million.

Campus leaders are developing guiding principles for allocation of our CARES Act funds. The U.S. Department of Education is expected to issue additional guidance and rules about the acceptable use and timeline for these funds, which will impact campus decisions.

We did some fundraising of our own last weekend during our fourth annual Give Day. We were a bit wary of going forward with this event during the pandemic, but ultimately decided our needs are too great especially our emergency funds, new and old, that are providing COVID-19 relief to our students and front-line workers. Not only did people respond, but they did so in a record way contributing more than $2.5 million to funds and programs all across the university, including $200,000 for those emergency funds I mentioned.

Earth Day and beyond
Before this pandemic, our Office of Sustainability had organized more than a month of activities to celebrate the 50th Earth Day. I want to thank everyone who pivoted quickly to move as many of those events online as possible. The calendar on our Earth Day website includes a World Climate Simulation next week (a program that can complement student learning in classes addressing climate change) and a virtual tour of our California Raptor Center on May 2.

Another Earth Day project is 50/50/50, in which we are all invited to submit essays, poems, artworks, posters, short films and music reflecting our thoughts about Earth Day when it began 50 years ago (those of us who are old enough to remember); our feelings today, on the 50th anniversary; and our vision for 50 years hence. Submit by email to sustainability@ucdavis.edu, and the team will assemble everything in a gallery on the Earth Day website.

I am heartened at a time like this to know we are in this together, taking care of one another and our planet (including the peregrine falcons who are the stars of a webcam show from their nest atop the UC Davis Medical Center be sure to check it out!).

Sincerely,

Gary S. May

1-May-20,Davis,"Checking In With Chancellor May: Signs of Hope
By News and Media Relations on May 1, 2020 in University
Thursday Thoughts: April 30, 2020

Chancellor Gary S. Mays Friday coronavirus update includes his Thursday Thoughts Instagram post, above. This week he and LeShelle are answering questions from the community.

To the UC Davis Community:

Shelter-in-place orders have been extended to May 22 in Sacramento County and May 31 in Yolo County, and, while some of you may be having a difficult time seeing any hint of a silver lining in the coronavirus cloud, I see signs of hope all around.

With revised public health orders, our health system is working to fully restore services within the next week for both the medical center and health care clinics around the region. (As a side note, the Emergency Department reports that it has been seeing more cases of delayed care  and hospital officials are urging people not to wait, that if they are worried about COVID-19 at the hospital, they neednt be. Watch this video to see the many steps being taken to reassure people they are safe in seeking care at UC Davis Health.)

Our veterinary hospital will start a similar, phased resumption of regular services this coming Monday (May 4). Some veterinary clinical services will initially be more available than others, and priority will still be given to more urgent cases as well as to existing clients.

Our research enterprise has guidelines in place to ramp back up. And we have our two Scenario Planning Groups at work, one dealing with instruction, the other with operations.

Assisting our counties
In addition, the campus is participating in making recommendations as Yolo County develops its plan for reopening. Three UC Davis officials  Eric Kvigne, associate vice chancellor for Safety Services; Mabel Salon, chief government and community relations officer; and Matt Dulcich, local government relations manager  serve on a stakeholders team, along with city and county and other representatives, to assist in implementing the countys Roadmap to Recovery.

Further, in letters we sent to the leadership of both Yolo and Sacramento counties, we offered our campuss technical and academic expertise as both counties develop plans and strategies for reopening regional business and other activities.  

In more good news, we are bringing blood drives back to campus. We have arranged for four collection days on the Davis campus, Thursday-Friday, May 21-22 and 28-29, for UC Davis affiliates and the community at large. Appointments are being taken now.

And lets not forget our grounds crew, back at work  with face coverings on  restoring our landscape to its usual pristine condition. Thank you, grounds crew.

Testing a vaccine and plasma
More reason for hope: Today (May 1), UC Davis and Verndari Inc. began preclinical testing of a COVID-19 vaccine. Its happening in our Mouse Biology Program, where researchers amended an existing protocol for influenza to allow for testing of the COVID-19 vaccine in an established rodent model. It will quickly provide the data we need before we can move into larger species, such as nonhuman primates, and human clinical trials.

Not only that, but the project involves a new delivery system, a VaxiPatch, in which an array of microneedles delivers the vaccine into your arm. The technology eliminates the need for refrigeration, facilitates high-volume, automated manufacturing of vaccines and can potentially be self-administered  all very important if we want to get this out to the public as fast as possible.

Human Health Sciences Vice Chancellor David Lubarsky rightly noted, This is exactly the type of combined business and academic effort our university excels at delivering. ... By working together with us at UC Davis, we can potentially help to address this global pandemic sooner rather than later.

In other COVID-19 research news:

Transfusions  UC Davis Health reported it had, for the first time, transfused blood from a recovered COVID-19 patient, into two other patients, in an effort to boost their ability to neutralize the virus and its devastating effects.
Antibodies  The health system implemented an accurate blood test to identify people who may have developed antibodies against the virus. The test is available to some UC Davis health care workers on a voluntary basis, and is expected to be available to other health care workers and the community in several weeks.
Davis-Sacramento connections
The connections between our Davis and Sacramento campuses are only growing stronger, in research and other ways.

A surgeon, Andrew Li, and a biomedical engineer, Tingrui Pan, for example, have come up with a prototype for a simple, inexpensive ventilator that uses microfluidics instead of mechanical parts.

I am also happy to report that 40 of our Davis campus custodians volunteered to temporarily transfer to the Sacramento campus. Theyre working in public areas as well as patient areas: emergency, exam and trauma. Thank you for stepping up.

And speaking of connections, our new Causeway Connection bus service starts Monday, on a reduced schedule during the pandemic, but still a cause for celebration as we launch a new fleet of all-electric buses, serving not only UC Davis affiliates but the public, carrying people between UC Davis Health and the Davis campus.

Technology for good and evil
Our faculty, staff and students continue to make excellent use of technology during spring quarter  big shout-out to all of our IT professionals who are assisting to keep people connected up and down the state, across the country and around the world.

Good news: We hesitated to call off our Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference, and, now we are happy to report it will proceed virtually, Thursday-Friday, May 7-8, with more than 500 participants. I know I will be watching (and Ill have to register like everyone else, by noon Wednesday, May 6).

Bad news: Zoombombing is real. In an April 10 letter posted here, Minming Wu Morri, campus privacy officer, and Cheryl Washington, chief information security officer, answered the question, What can you do? Ensure that you are using the latest version of Zoom and that you are enabling the newest Zoom privacy and security features, described here and in our Zoom Privacy and Security FAQs. These features are user-controlled and must be turned on.

Note: Unit IT leads are receiving updates from the campus privacy and information security offices on the latest issues and recommended fixes. Again, consult the Zoom Privacy and Security FAQs, which are being updated weekly with the latest developments on privacy and security.

Relief funds, summer programs
We are happy to report today that emergency relief payments related to the pandemic will be going out soon to undergraduates and graduate and professional school students with financial need. We are grateful to provide this support to a large portion of our student population, using CARES Act funds from the federal government and supplemental funds from campus.

And while the Department of Education prohibited the distribution of CARES Act money to DACA students, please know UC Davis and all UC campuses will use their own funding to assist DACA students in need. Please see my letter from earlier this week in (continued) support of our DACA students.

As summer nears, we have new guidance for instructors of Summer Session courses and directors of other campus-based summer programs. We announced April 10 that instruction in both Summer Sessions will be remote, though, if health directives change, some in-person laboratory courses may be possible in Summer Session II. In addition, uncertainty about how and when Yolo County Public Health guidance may change leads us to suggest that other campus-based summer programs should plan to be remote if possible.

We now have a process set up whereby instructors and program directors can seek approval for in-person instruction or program delivery, for instances in which program goals cannot be met without it, and when the instructor believes the program can be conducted in-person in accordance with then-current public health guidance. Please contact Risk Management Services to start the process, which will need final approval by the appropriate vice chancellor, or the provost and executive vice chancellor.

Walk the talk
As we enter our seventh week of shelter-in-place, please dont forget about getting some exercise. And be sure to participate in the 11th annual UC Walks, a virtual event this year, from Sunday to Sunday, May 3-10. Everything counts, not just walking! Do Zumba in your living room or any other workout you like to do  whatever gets you moving! Learn more and register here, then report back after you put in at least 30 minutes of exercise. In return, youll get a T-shirt (while supplies last), and have a chance to win prizes (including a FitBit).

So, thats one thing you can do during shelter-in-place. Heres another idea:  Attend the California Raptor Centers annual spring open house, to be held virtually, tomorrow (May 2).

Or, how about if I read to you and your children? Sacramento City Councilwoman Angelique Ashby invited me to participate in Storytime Sacramento, and, if you go to the website, you can find the video recording of me reading Ice Is Nice! from The Cat in the Hats Learning Library, a book about the North and South poles, and climate change. Youll find my story in Chapter 2.

Whatever you do with your family, please remember, hope is all around.

Sincerely,

Gary S. May
Chancellor"

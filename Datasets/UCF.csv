https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/focusing-on-our-mission/,21-May-2020,"As we are all adjusting to the different realities of COVID-19, my attention has been on ensuring that UCF’s mission of serving our students, scholars and state continues unabated.

In navigating the uncertainties of the pandemic and focusing on achieving operational excellence across the institution, strong and consistent leadership of our academic enterprise will be crucial to our success. This will provide us stability during a time when change and uncertainty have become a new normal.

To help us move forward, I have asked Dr. Michael Johnson to serve as our interim provost and vice president for Academic Affairs for the next two years, anticipating that we would launch a national search no earlier than Fall 2021.

Dr. Johnson’s strong institutional knowledge has been invaluable as I have transitioned to UCF. He is a leader of the highest integrity who has earned the respect of those across campus during his 30-year tenure here.

As we continue to navigate the year ahead, Dr. Johnson will be an instrumental partner in creating positive change, strengthening our academic and research programs and providing leadership to enterprise-level initiatives that will make us more effective and transparent, such as the redesign of our budget model. Dr. Johnson also will help ensure that voices across the university — particularly those of our faculty — are more involved in decision-making.

Our institutional planning requires our best collective thinking to engage in creative and compelling ways that will help UCF emerge stronger.

I am appreciative of the teams across the university that have come together to help with our plans to move forward during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the active engagement from the Faculty Senate earlier this week, and the groups, such as departments’ Human Resources advisors, who have shared their questions and have provided guidance to our planning efforts.

As we plan for the slow return of faculty, staff and eventually our students to campus, in all of our decisions, we will continue to prioritize our community’s health and well-being and provide more opportunities for your input and questions before we share our plans with the Florida Board of Governors next month. We also will continue sharing more information on UCF’s evolving practices and protocols both via email and on the university’s coronavirus website.

Additional Leadership Updates
We will soon begin our national searches for our chief financial officer and chief operations officer, as well as a third national search for a new chief information officer coinciding with Dr. Joel Hartman’s retirement on July 1.

For all three searches, I am committed to an inclusive process with representation from across the university, including faculty, staff, students and administrators. I also hope to engage community leaders, alumni and partners who have expertise in these administrative areas.

A Culture of Inclusion and Diversity
Closely aligned with decisions on leadership and strengthening our operations is a focus on UCF’s culture, specifically our strong commitment to inclusion and diversity.

One of the reasons I was attracted to UCF is because of the great pride we take in the depth and breadth of the diversity among our employees and student body, which is approaching majority minority, as well as our Hispanic-serving designation.

One thing already is clear to me: We must have an executive at the highest level who is focused on how we can become more inclusive and diverse across our entire campus, including in our leadership roles, and in our connections to the community. I am working closely with our Interim Chief Equity, Inclusion and Diversity Officer Dr. Kent Butler to review the results of our recent campus climate survey and develop a high-level plan for investing in UCF’s inclusion and diversity initiatives.

As we continue to move forward, I will be sharing more information with you about our next steps for our open leadership searches and opportunities for us to engage digitally — all of which are geared toward helping UCF become even more exceptional in our academics, operations and service.

Thank you for your commitment to working together to “Charge On” through an unusual summer and in planning for a different type of fall.

All the best,

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/ucf-research-restarting-labs/,20-May-2020,"COVID-19 has impacted all of us in some way. The disruptions shut down most of our research operations in March, and I know you have been eagerly awaiting word on when you can get back. I appreciate your patience.

Since April, I have been working with a dedicated team of faculty researchers, administrators and others to put together a plan for you to return to your laboratories. The task force’s main objective was to keep everyone as safe as possible, while increasing research activity in a phased approach. We also adopted several principles to keep us focused on your needs. The phased approach enhances safety and also gives the university the flexibility to scale up or down as changes in the pandemic necessitate.

If you can conduct your research remotely, please continue to do so. For others, we will begin the phased return to laboratories tomorrow, Thursday, May 21.

There will be several things you need to do before you can walk into your lab. In addition to wearing face coverings while on campus, observing physical distancing and washing hands often, there are six steps to getting access and keeping access during this time.

The Basics
Everyone in your research lab must wear face coverings while on campus. This includes getting to and from your lab, inside your lab (in addition to any face coverings your research requires that you wear) and in any shared common spaces, including elevators. If your research team includes students, they too, must wear face coverings and remain 6 feet apart from each other, while also regularly washing hands after completing each task, and after touching doors and shared surfaces.

Limited Supplies
As you can imagine, personal protective equipment is in high demand. If you have the necessary face coverings for your team and cleaning supplies to ensure your lab is disinfected, we ask that you use those supplies first.

If you do not have what you need, please call 407-882-7111. UCF’s Department of Emergency Management, with support from Resource Management, is working to source PPE, track requests and disburse items based on need.

Because safety is our priority, you may not enter your lab until you can secure these basic items. With these supplies in hand, you can move onto the six steps to access your lab.

Six Steps for Lab Access
Receive authorization from your Associate Dean of Research to gain access to your lab. Authorization is based on the research activity tiers. Currently, limited activities in Tiers 1-4 have been authorized.
Complete required training. This includes any outstanding EHS training, as well as new training prepared specifically for COVID-19. Log in through EHS portal.
Plan and prepare written safety procedures for your lab, including how you will clean and disinfect areas. The procedures must be clearly displayed in the lab using the COVID-19 Laboratory Restart form.
Schedule no more than 1 person per 200-square-feet at any given time, unless there are different safety requirements. The same is true for personnel using any office space linked to your lab.
Keep a copy of the weekly schedule of all lab personnel to help track any potential exposure, should that become necessary.
All people entering the lab must complete daily check-in and check-out forms.
Human Subject Research
We did not forget about all of our researchers working with human subjects. Your work is equally important, but presents additional challenges amid this pandemic.

All research involving face-to-face interaction that could not be done via a different mechanism such as phone, Skype or Zoom was halted on April 10 because of the increased risk to the researchers and subjects. The temporary IRB protocol revisions are still in effect for now.

The task force is working with the Institutional Review Board to create an approach tailored to your needs. More information about the next steps will be coming soon.

We know these requirements may seem daunting, but they are necessary to help enhance your safety and the safety of those around you.

We trust that everyone will comply with these new requirements, but we are aware that there may be a few who decide to ignore or fail to follow the rules. We also understand that some of you may be uncomfortable speaking up in those circumstances. The Integrity Line at 1-855-877-6049 or ucfintegrityline.com offers an opportunity to share your concerns anonymously.

Please continue to pay attention to your email for additional updates from the Office of Research. Additional emails about broader return to campus plans, including policies about safety during COVID-19 and enforcement, will be coming soon.

You can find all the information pertaining to this announcement for lab researchers at corona.research.ucf.edu.

Rest assured we didn’t create this system to make life difficult. Restarting research is a unique challenge for all of us, and there are bound to be hiccups. I ask you for your continued patience as we move through this process. We created this system to keep you safe and let us all get back to one of our core missions at UCF — conducting research that makes an impact. Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions.

Thanks again for your patience, understanding and cooperation during these trying times.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/our-return-to-campus-and-leadership-update/,13-May-2020,"As businesses and other entities across the state begin bringing back employees, UCF soon will as well, with a phased-in approach for faculty and staff returning to campus.

Since last month, teams from across the university have been working on what our return to the workplace, research labs, classrooms and campus life would look like. In all of our planning, we are prioritizing the safety of our entire campus community and following guidance from public health officials and Governor DeSantis’ plan for reopening Florida.

These measures will begin later this month for researchers who require access to their labs. They will receive detailed direction from the Office of Research with updates on how they and others will be able to operate in labs across campus and in the Central Florida Research Park. While it is critical that our research enterprise continues, we must do so safely with new procedures and physical distancing practices.

Over the next two weeks, campus leadership and supervisors will receive additional guidance for how we will pilot a slow return to work across campus beginning June 1. Working with your supervisor, individuals who are at a higher risk, have dependent-care responsibilities or can effectively work remotely can continue to do so.

More information about safety precautions, including educational trainings, wearing facial coverings, physical distancing, encouraging virtual meetings and increased cleanings of frequently touched surfaces, will be shared soon.

As we phase in our return to campus, we will remain vigilant through the summer and into the fall. Together, we will continue to adjust our practices based upon the latest available guidance from local and state officials, always with the goal of creating a safe environment for everyone at UCF.

Our teams continue to plan for how and when we will welcome back our students into classrooms, residence halls and campus activities and are working closely with the Florida Board of Governors. We hope to share decisions about the fall semester in June.

Leadership Updates
When I became president, I knew that managing the challenges from COVID-19 would be my No. 1 priority. I also believe that UCF’s long-term stability and success come from having strong leaders at every level of the university who empower everyone to perform to their highest potential.
We have been fortunate to have interim leaders who have helped the institution through the transitions of the past two years. It is time to begin building a permanent cabinet that will guide UCF’s future. The pandemic has proven it is more important than ever to focus on greater efficiencies and effectiveness in everything we do.

That is why we will be launching national searches for a chief financial officer and chief operations officer. Both will be critical to ensuring our operational excellence and helping us to strategically invest in the university’s academic enterprise moving forward.
More information about both searches will be shared soon. In the meantime, I am grateful to our interim CFO Joe Trubacz and interim COO Misty Shepherd for their continued leadership. I also appreciate the dedication and hard work of the people in each of their areas who have led UCF’s financial and administrative operations through a turbulent time.

Our people drive our greatness. The optimism and energy with which you face challenges demonstrate our strong commitment to our mission – even as the ways we work, teach and conduct our research change. I know UCF is full of talented and creative people who will continue to “Charge On” to new heights, building our future together.

Thank you once again for your patience as we all navigate the impact of COVID-19. Your safety remains our priority, and we will continue to make decisions about move-out with everyone’s health and well-being in mind. Below are the instructions for moving your belongings out of your room. There are three steps to follow, including two options for move-out. Please note that all key access has been deactivated and you must choose one of the below options to retrieve your belongings.

 

Step 1: Register your retrieval option in the Housing Portal (Open Now)
Log into the Housing Portal and click on the Belonging Retrieval Form to indicate the option you are choosing.

Option 1: I will schedule with Suddath, a third-party moving company, to pack and ship my belongings. I understand there is a charge for this service and that all scheduling, billing and details will be arranged directly with Suddath.

Option 2: I will schedule a move-out appointment with Housing to personally remove my belongings.

 

Step 2: Schedule Your Move
If you select Option 1, you will need to contact Suddath directly (using the Suddath resident move-out site) to arrange your moving appointment, billing and shipping arrangements.

If you select Option 2, you will choose a move-out appointment time in the Housing Portal beginning the week of May 4. We will send an additional email when the move-out appointments are available in the Housing Portal. Move-out appointments will take place from May 21 through June 17.

 

Step 3: Move out
Option 1: Moving Company (May 6 – 20)
Suddath will work during your scheduled appointment time to pack, store, ship or discard items as per your agreement with them. Suddath is not able to donate belongings on your behalf.

At the scheduled time, UCF DHRL staff will give Suddath access to the contracted room(s).
DHRL staff will be on-site in offices during the time Suddath staff is packing belongings.
Suddath staff will hold a video conference with the student during packing to ensure identification of the correct belongings.
All Suddath employees will be clearly identified via uniform and are Level 2 background checked, which means they have passed a state and national fingerprint-based check that considers disqualifying offenses for employees in positions of trust. UCF will not assume any costs or liability for lost or damaged items.
The average cost per resident will range between $200 and $265, excluding long-term storage fees and shipping distances. Charges will vary based on selected services.

You will return to campus during your scheduled appointment date and time to move your belongings out.

Appointments are 2 hours in length.
To maintain appropriate social distancing, you may bring no more than 2 additional individuals to assist.
Appointments are limited by building or floor to adhere with social distancing guidelines.
Safety measures will include stanchions and tape on ground for proper distancing.
We strongly recommend you bring your own masks and gloves.
Key return and express check-out will be a touch-free process.
You will only have access to your room on the day of your move out appointment.
DHRL staff will be on-site in offices during move out appointment times.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/help-for-employees-during-the-covid-19-crisis/,29-Apr-2020,"The past weeks have been difficult for all of us. COVID-19 has changed the ways that we work and live. Yesterday, President Cartwright wrote to us about some of the financial challenges the university is addressing. While UCF continues to plan next steps with everyone’s health and safety in mind, I want to address the personal hardships that many of you are facing now and offer some help.

I am thrilled to announce that our family of UCF employees answered the call for help and donated over 100,000 hours of personally accrued leave time to support our coworkers who have exhausted their own leave and are unable to work because of COVID-19.

Our faculty, who are working now to finish grading for the semester, have asked for a few more days to complete their donations. We are very happy to hear that there are more employees who want to help and have extended the donation window to May 11. We continue to gratefully accept donations at https://www.ucf.edu/lp/knights-care-leave-share/.

Many of us are working remotely and will continue to do so until further notice and pending conversations with our supervisors. Unfortunately, many UCF employees cannot work right now for a number of reasons including jobs that cannot be performed remotely, caring for children whose schools are closed, or the direct impact of a COVID-19 illness. For many of these employees, Emergency Paid Sick Leave will run out tomorrow, April 30.

For employees unable to work because of caring for a minor at home, I urge you to apply now for Emergency Family and Medical Leave: https://hr.ucf.edu/families-first-coronavirus-response-act/.

For leave-accruing employees who are unable to work because of COVID-19, your colleagues have generously provided for your support. Once you have exhausted your personally accrued leave, please request leave share at: https://www.ucf.edu/lp/knights-care-leave-share/

We are counting on supervisors and HR liaisons to help employees understand what leave they might be eligible to receive. HR has created a resource to help with this: https://hr.ucf.edu/files/COVID19-Leave-Options-at-a-Glance.pdf. Of course, your points of contacts in UCF Human Resources are always available to assist.

Finally, I want to remind you that UCF offers an excellent Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides a multitude of free resources, including information, training, counseling, and other forms of assistance and referrals to all non-student employees. I would encourage anyone wanting to better care for themselves or their family or who is uncertain about where to turn for emotional support to check out the EAP: https://HealthAdvocate.com/members.

As President Cartwright mentioned yesterday, we do not know for sure what the future holds for us as the university awaits future guidance from public health and government officials. We do know, however, that the UCF community will get through this together.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for giving so generously and for working so hard to help each other and to serve our students. You make me proud to be a Knight.

That’s why we are happy to share that thanks to federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or “CARES” Act, UCF will soon distribute more than $25 million in aid to our eligible students who need it most.

This is an important step in helping eligible students overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic and continue on their paths to academic and career success. The funds are designed to assist with expenses for undergraduate, graduate and MD students related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, such as housing, food, course materials, technology, health care and child care.

Students can apply for the aid here: https://tinyurl.com/UCF-CARES-ACT-Funding. The application window will be open through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, May 19.

Note that students must have submitted a 2019-2020 FAFSA or must submit a FAFSA application in order to be eligible for the funding. The federal legislation requires that students be degree-seeking, enrolled in the term for which they are seeking assistance, and U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens in order to be eligible for the emergency funding. Additionally, UCF Online students are not eligible.

All applications will be considered, but UCF’s focus is on helping eligible students with the most urgent needs. For example, students who have had difficulty paying off-campus rent or who had to purchase equipment to complete their courses online will be prioritized over students who received housing or dining refunds.

Due to the anticipated high volume of applications and the process reviewing applications, we expect that it will be 3-4 weeks before students will receive the money.

We hope that knowing that support could be coming offers some sense of relief.

Despite the incredible challenges from COVID-19, you have acted boldly to best serve our students and help our community through building a community of scholarship entirely online, making masks for our heroes and helpers, partnering with Central Florida’s front-line responders to battle the virus and in many other innovative ways.

There is no doubt the past several weeks have been difficult. The pandemic has had devastating effects on universities and communities across the world. While we do not yet know its full impact in Florida or on UCF, the information and data we will learn during the next month will be critical to our decision-making.

Our leadership team is planning for a variety of scenarios for possible impacts to our operations and how and when we could reopen the campus, including what it means for our teaching, research, clinical, student support, athletics and other activities.

These decisions will be made consistent with federal and state guidance with our UCF family’s health and safety top of mind and in coordination with the colleges and administrative units, the UCF Board of Trustees and the Florida Board of Governors.

For now, we are operating under the assumption that face-to-face classes would resume this fall, with social distancing and other protective measures that prioritize the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and campus visitors.

This means we likely will need to think differently about how our learning, research and work environments look and function going forward. We also are planning for other scenarios that involve a later start for face-to-face classes. I expect we will decide on the fall semester in June, and we will share that update with you.

Better Ways of Working Together
The pandemic has also made clear a responsibility for us to find more efficiencies in areas across the university so that we can emerge from these challenges a stronger institution. While our leadership team is closely looking at improvements we can make to the ways we work, it is up to all of us to consider how we can operate more effectively in support of our students and academic mission, especially in the face of financial uncertainties created by COVID-19.

Thanks to the federal CARES Act, UCF has received $51 million to support university operations and students impacted by COVID-19. This is the largest allocation to any Florida university and the fourth-largest in the nation, as the legislation prioritized schools serving the most Pell-eligible students.

Half of those funds will go directly to support our students with the greatest need in the form of emergency aid. The other half will help to offset some of the financial losses we are projecting through the summer. Other actions, like hiring, travel and purchasing freezes we instituted earlier this month, should save us $13 million through this fiscal year.

Together, these efforts will help us offset the financial strains of COVID-19, but we will continue to look for other efficiencies and understand the potential that ongoing financial impacts could require difficult decisions. I do not believe we can simply cut our way to excellence. We must continue to strategically invest in the human capital, initiatives and programs that will make UCF exceptional.

Our success is because of our talented people and a culture of innovation and grit that believes anything is possible — as shown by each of this semester’s graduating students.

This week, I hope you will join me in celebrating these graduates’ achievements during Saturday’s virtual commencement ceremonies, while also reflecting on everything you and our students have accomplished in this extraordinary time.

All the best,

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/drive-through-testing-starts-wednesday-in-lake-nona/,27-Apr-2020,"On April 29, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site will open in Lake Nona through a partnership between the UCF College of Medicine, Aventus Health and Tavistock.

The testing is by appointment only for people across the community. Patients must have a test order from a physician. Testing is covered by insurance. Those without insurance can get a free test through federal assistance.

Appointments will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday in the parking lot behind UCF Lake Nona Cancer Center, 6400 Sanger Road, Orlando FL 32827. Appointments may end before 5 p.m. if the 250 daily appointments are filled earlier.

Public health officials stay that more widespread testing is key in getting our community, state and nation back to “normal.” Screening those who show symptoms allows us to identify and treat those who are ill, identify those they came in contact with and tell them they must isolate to stop further spread.

COVID-19 symptoms include:

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
If you wish to be tested, follow these steps:

If you have an order for a test from your healthcare provider: Call Aventus Health directly to schedule a testing appointment at 407-986-0133
If you are a patient at UCF Health — the College of Medicine’s physician practice — or are a UCF employee: Contact UCF Health to obtain an order for a test by calling 407-266-3627
If you need to speak to a physician about getting a test: Get in touch with Aventus Health directly by calling 855-282-4860
After the patient has been screened by a provider, Aventus will reach out to complete all necessary paperwork, including insurance coverage and schedule an appointment for testing. Upon arrival during a scheduled time, individuals will drive through and receive the testing with a swab designated specifically for them. Following the 10-minute test, they’ll receive results in 24 to 48 hours.

The College of Medicine site is the second UCF drive-through testing location. COVID-19 testing continues on the main campus in Garage A.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/housing-information-and-update-for-parents/,27-Apr-2020,"As we continue to adapt to our “new normal,” UCF understands that many of our students and their families are experiencing hardships.

This is a stressful time for everyone, and we appreciate your patience as university leaders continue to make decisions in the best interests of our students, faculty and staff members, and our larger community.

Last month, UCF’s Board of Trustees approved refunds for on-campus housing for the Spring 2020 semester.

At the same time, UCF leaders sent a letter to off-campus housing managers urging them to be flexible with students in light of hardships caused by COVID-19. UCF continues to advocate on behalf of students, but the decision to offer refunds or terminate off-campus leases ultimately resides with the individual privately-owned properties.

Since sharing these updates, we’ve received many housing-related questions, and we’ve addressing those here.

What resources exist for students experiencing financial hardships?
UCF’s Knights Emergency Fund offers financial assistance to students who are experiencing a distressing situation that significantly impacts academic or personal success. Those in need are urged to contact them to see what assistance is available: https://scs.sdes.ucf.edu/.

In addition, thanks to federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or “CARES” Act, UCF will soon be able to distribute more than $25 million in aid to our students who need it most. These emergency grants can be used for eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care. Additional information, including how to apply for this funding, will be communicated to students this week.

What is “managed housing?”
Managed housing is an agreement where UCF acts as the property manager for privately-owned student housing. Generally, UCF is responsible for facilitating the leases with students, marketing the property to students, providing resident assistants and programs, as well as certain maintenance responsibilities, and in exchange, UCF is paid a fee for managing the property. The private owner is responsible for setting lease rates and the building and program budgets.

Northview, UnionWest and Rosen College Housing are UCF managed housing.

What is “affiliated housing?”
Affiliated housing is a step removed from managed housing. In this situation, private owners engage another private company to manage the student housing. The property manager engages UCF to provide very limited services – such as resident assistants or programming — to the property. UCF also agrees to refer students to affiliated housing in the event the university-owned and managed housing is full. In affiliated housing, UCF does not facilitate any of the leasing arrangements; rather these are the responsibility of the property manager.

Knights Circle and the Pointe at Central are affiliated with UCF.

Are there any other managed or affiliated housing communities?
No. All other housing properties and complexes surrounding UCF are privately-owned apartments that are neither affiliated nor managed by UCF.

Does UCF have the legal ability to require the owners of managed or affiliated housing to refund to students?
No. Because UCF does not own the properties, we can only encourage – not require – the owners to offer financial flexibility to students, and we are actively doing so.

Why do UCF shuttles run to complexes the university doesn’t own?
UCF shuttles run daily to several apartment complexes around the main campus to assist students who may not have adequate transportation to get to classes. Having a shuttle stop at an apartment complex does not mean that complex is managed or affiliated with the university. Rather, shuttles are managed by UCF and funded by the per-credit-hour Transportation Access Fee, and the service is offered by the university as a convenience for students.

When can I move my student out?
At this time, students are discouraged from returning to campus, in line with the state’s “Safer At Home” order, which calls for avoiding non-essential travel and relying on social distancing to stop further spread of COVID-19.

Housing and Residence Life is providing residents with two options for retrieving belongings from their room in the future:

Option 1: We have partnered with a university-approved vendor for residents and their families to directly arrange packing, storing and shipping options. This will take place during the month of May and may be an ideal option for out-of-state students.
Option 2: Residents will sign up for a first come, first served move-out appointment to return to campus and conduct an express check out in alignment with social distancing guidelines. This will take place May through July.
More information about these options will be communicated to residents in the coming days. For now, Housing asks that residents select their preferred option in the Housing Portal.

Will students receive refunds for summer housing?
Summer 2020 rent for students who live on campus has not been billed and will not be billed unless an exemption is granted for students with extenuating circumstances to remain on campus. Because summer rent has not yet been billed, there will not be a refund process.

At this time no decision has been made about refunds for students who live in UnionWest and NorthView.

Please continue to stay safe and prioritize your health and well-being. Continue to check UCF’s coronavirus website for updates, and know students may also receive additional information via email.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/a-strong-finish-to-the-spring-semester/,24-Apr-2020,"While the Spring 2020 semester is coming to an end in ways none of us could have anticipated, the sense of excitement and accomplishment that comes with the completion of the school year is present.

UCF is proud of our students’ resiliency and resolve in these challenging and uncertain times. Our students truly embody what it means to “Charge On!”

Thanks to federal relief from the “CARES Act,” UCF will be distributing $25.5 million in emergency aid to students with the most urgent need. We will share more information about how to apply for this funding soon, as part of our strong commitment to student success and helping one another through this difficult time.

While the trajectory of COVID-19 remains unknown, for now, let’s take a moment to reflect on the great work accomplished this spring and focus on a successful end to the semester.

Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading
The S/U opt-in period remains open through 11:59 p.m. Monday, April 27.

Given the disruptions of COVID-19, this allows students (except for M.D. students) to select whether they would like a S/U grade or letter grade for each of their Spring 2020 classes. Choices can be made or changed at any time up to next week’s deadline.

Instructions for choosing the S/U option are available here.

Students are reminded to consult with their advisors about their options and whether selecting S/U grading is a wise choice for them. To better understand S/U grading and potential implications, students are also encouraged to review these FAQs for undergraduate and graduate students.

Textbook Information
While UCF Bookstores are not physically open, operations are moving forward with staff available to assist students virtually.
Students with access to their textbooks: Rentals can be shipped back to the bookstore they were rented from free of charge using the appropriate return label.

UCF Main Campus
UCF Downtown
UCF Rosen College
If textbooks were purchased, students can sell them back for cash. The bookstore has partnered with MBS Textbook Exchange for online buyback options.

Students who do not have access to their textbooks: To accommodate students during these challenging times, the rental return deadline has been extended to June 15.

Students enrolled in summer classes: When available, choose a digital format for instant access to textbooks and course materials. Free shipping will be available for new, used and rental textbooks through the bookstore website, but note that shipping times may be longer than usual due to local delivery conditions. Students can find their upcoming semester course materials through my.ucf.edu → Student Self Service → My Class Schedule.

Virtual Commencement
UCF’s Spring 2020 class includes more than 8,600 students who will celebrate with us during virtual commencement ceremonies on May 2.

Former UCF football stars Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin — who currently play for the Seattle Seahawks — will serve as commencement speakers during the virtual ceremonies, which will be hosted on UCF’s Facebook and YouTube pages so that graduates and their families, friends and faculty members can watch.

More information and the time of each college’s ceremony are available here.

What’s Next
Remote instruction will continue for all summer sessions, meaning that the earliest face-to-face classes could resume is in the fall. UCF will announce a decision about fall classes in June.

To help our students registered for summer classes, UCF is waiving the Transportation Access Fee, which will result in savings of $2.5 million for our students. When applicable, the Materials and Supply Fee also will be waived for summer courses. UCF is not considering waiving additional summer fees or providing refunds for Spring 2020 fees at this time.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/bringing-a-challenging-semester-to-a-successful-close/,20-Apr-2020,"As the end of a historic semester approaches, I want to tell you how very proud I am of how our faculty have responded to the greatest teaching challenge of our professional lives.

The abrupt shift to remote teaching required a heavy lift in a very short time. In a single week, our faculty, with help from the Division of Digital Learning, moved almost 6,000 face-to-face and blended sections to remote delivery. This transition occurred in the midst of personal struggles with family care, health concerns, working remotely and, for some, personal loss. Add to that the emotional labor of supporting struggling students, and it is a heavy load.

I am grateful for all that you’ve done and how you continue to support our students and one another.

This sudden change has not, of course, been seamless for faculty or for students. Collectively, our students are facing job loss, fear of illness and the future, and the switch to remote classes. For more students than we would like, this is a hard time. The same is true for our colleagues who work for UCF.

As the semester nears an end, I again ask that you treat your students and one another with compassion. Students with technology problems, illness, or anxiety may need your consideration to complete assignments or exams.

Please also take the online “Kognito At-Risk” training to learn more about how to help students at risk. Instructions are at https://hr.ucf.edu/files/Kognito-Course-Completion-Guide.pdf.

We have been offered a simple way to help our UCF colleagues in need: to donate sick leave hours (or annual leave hours for 12-month employees). Faculty collectively have over 1 million hours of sick leave. Please consider donating some of yours at https://www.ucf.edu/lp/knights-care-leave-share/#donating-leave. I have donated, and I hope you will too.

Our faculty and staff have worked hard to keep our university running as smoothly as possible through remote teaching and working. Even before my arrival, I have been so impressed by your innovative spirit and commitment to our students — and each other — during these challenges.

Through the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, UCF employees are eligible to receive up to two weeks of paid sick leave. But some members of our UCF family already need extended leaves of absence to take care of themselves or their families, while others are unable to work remotely.

That’s why we are launching the Knights Care Leave Share. Through this program, you are able to donate your annual and sick leave into a UCF-sponsored leave bank for your fellow employees who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and have exhausted all of their personal leave. Eligible recipients will be paid their normal rate.

Leave donations will be accepted through April 24. The program is entirely voluntary. If you would like to and are able to donate your time to your colleagues, you can do so by submitting a donation form. If you need a donation, please ask for help by completing an application.

This means that the earliest face-to-face classes could resume is in the fall. At this time, remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

We recognize that this news may be disappointing for some of you and reassuring for others, while also leading to many questions.

While we don’t yet know the long-term impact of this pandemic, we wanted to make this decision well in advance to give students and faculty time to plan. Know that UCF has made this decision with the health and safety of our campus and broader communities top of mind.

In the coming weeks we’ll have more information to share about how this decision impacts you.

For Students
Student support functions, such as academic advising, financial aid, counseling and other essential resources, will continue to be offered remotely to help you be successful. UCF Keep Learning is another helpful resource to help students navigate online learning.

Incoming students will attend orientation virtually, and we are working on additional support services to help them thrive at UCF during the period of remote instruction and beyond.

No decision about summer commencement ceremonies has been made at this time.

Housing
In light of continued remote instruction, on-campus summer housing will not be available except for those students with extenuating circumstances who will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

More information will be shared directly with residents soon, and we ask for your patience as we navigate this challenging process.

It remains imperative that residents who didn’t return to campus after Spring Break not return to move out and retrieve their belongings. This is in line with the state’s “Safer At Home” order. We understand the strong desire to do so and will communicate information about moving out at a time when it is safe and prudent to do so.

For Faculty
We hope faculty are utilizing UCF Keep Teaching and have become familiar with our Faculty Toolkit.

Our Division of Digital Learning will remain a resource for faculty as they tailor summer courses to an online format.

S/U Grading Opt-In Period
Starting Friday, most students will be able to select whether they would like a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade or a letter grade for each of their Spring 2020 classes. The opt-in period will be open until 11:59 p.m. April 27.

There are important factors to consider when making this decision, but given the possible academic disruptions and hardships students have faced in the wake of COVID-19, this gives them the ability to select the option that works best for them. Students are highly encouraged to consult with their advisors about their options.

To also help students think critically about the impacts of their decision, we’ve put together FAQs for undergraduate and graduate students. Instructions about how to opt-in to S/U grading are available here.

Updates for Employees
As a reminder, remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

UCF HR has been working to adapt to federal, state and university guidance related to COVID-19 and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the federal legislation that took effect on April 1.

UCF will continue to provide paid administrative leave through April 16 to eligible faculty and A&P and USPS employees who are unable to work remotely or on campus.

Use of emergency paid sick leave also has been expanded for all eligible employees who are unable to work due to the governor’s Safer At Home Order that took effect April 3. The expansion allows employees — including OPS — to use emergency paid sick leave if they are unable to work remotely or on campus because of the order. This includes employees whose units do not currently have work they can do.

Employees currently on administrative leave will be eligible to use emergency paid sick leave to cover hours they are unable to work from April 17-30 due to the Safer At Home Order.

Employees have already been granted the total hours of emergency paid sick leave they are eligible to receive and can view their leave balances on their April 10 paychecks via myUCF.

Review the updated HR FAQs. Employees are encouraged to reach out to their HR liaisons with any questions.

Testing Site on Campus
On Monday, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site opened in UCF’s Garage A, providing up to 250 tests a day on weekdays to members of the community with a prescription and appointment.

Students and faculty and staff members who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 are encouraged to reach out to a healthcare provider and inquire about testing. Students should contact Student Health Services at 407-823-2701. Faculty or staff members should call UCF Health at 407-266-3627.

Upon calling, individuals will be given an appointment to be screened for symptoms. Those who qualify for testing will be provided a prescription, which will then be sent to Aventus — the third-party company facilitating the testing — to schedule a time for testing.

Tests are administered efficiently via a drive-through process that takes no more than 10 minutes from the start of the appointment time, and results can be expected within 24-48 hours.

Additional Information
In this period of dynamic change and unprecedented challenge, our students and faculty and staff members keep charging on.

Please continue to do your part in combatting COVID-19 by staying home as much as possible, practicing social distancing and taking personal health precautions, including proper hand-washing and avoiding touching your face and frequently touched surfaces.

There are many important factors to consider before selecting or bypassing the S/U option. The option may not be a wise choice for students in all circumstances. For example, in selecting S/U grading, there may be issues associated with financial aid, meeting major requirements, honors, etc.

Students are highly encouraged to consult with their advisors about their options. To better understand S/U grading and potential implications, students are also encouraged to review these FAQs for undergraduate and graduate students.

How Will This S/U Option Work?
Faculty members will continue to assign grades as outlined in the syllabi. At the end of the semester, the grades they submit will be converted by the Registrar’s Office to either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, for students selecting this option. For undergraduate students who opt for S/U grading, grades A through C will be marked Satisfactory (S); for graduate students, A through B- will be Satisfactory (S). The grade designation will appear on transcripts with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this spring semester because of the pandemic. Neither S or U grades will affect the GPA. Finally, students who do not choose to opt into the S/U grading need to take no further action.

By now, I hope students are utilizing the online resources available at Keep Learning. For faculty, we have created Keep Teaching and a Faculty Toolkit with other resources.

UCF will issue dining membership refunds to eligible students who are no longer on campus and have discontinued use of their dining membership.

Eligible students will receive a prorated refund based on the unused portion of their dining membership for the spring 2020 semester beginning March 16, 2020. The refund will also include unused spring dining dollars.

For students who have been approved to stay on campus, dining memberships will remain active.
For students who did not return to campus on or after Monday, March 16, a partial dining membership refund will be issued. The refund will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals after March 16, plus the total amount of unused spring dining dollars.
For students who returned to campus on or after Monday, March 16, but subsequently left campus early due to COVID-19, a partial refund will be issued. The refund will be calculated by adding the prorated amount of unused meals from the last date of use after March 16, plus the total amount of unused spring dining dollars.
Refunds will be posted in eligible students’ accounts and will be shown in their myUCF account. Most students have their student account linked to a bank through direct deposit. Students who do not have direct deposit are encouraged to sign up by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, and clicking Direct Deposit.

Students who have not set up direct deposit before refunds are posted will have checks sent to their mailing address on file with UCF.

GRADING SYSTEM AND GPAs
The university uses an alphabetic system to identify student grades and other actions regarding student progress or class attendance, as follows. Refer to the catalog for detailed information.

Grades	Grading Points Per Semester Hour of Credit
A	4.00
A-	3.75
B+	3.25
B	3.00
B-	2.75
C+	2.25
C	2.00
C-	1.75
D+	1.25
D	1.00
D-	.75
F	0.00
NC	No Credit (replaces the use of D+, D and D- in certain cases)
S	Satisfactory (with credit) satisfactory progress
U	Unsatisfactory (no credit) unsatisfactory progress
If you choose to change your letter graded courses to an S/U grade, those selected courses with grades that are equivalent to a A, A-, B+, B or B- grades will be converted to a Satisfactory (S) grade.

If your instructor agrees to give you an Incomplete (I) grade, and you wish to opt in for S/U grading, you must opt in by April 27 for that course. Then, once you complete the course requirements (or fail to complete the course requirements in the time allowed), your earned letter grade will be converted to S/U on your transcript.

Grades of C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F or NC will be converted to an Unsatisfactory (U) grade. Keep in mind that most labs are linked directly to the course. If you are registered for a lab that is graded separately and does not require you to be registered simultaneously to the lecture, then the option will exist.

Grades of S and U do not impact the GPA. A grade of S will result in credit for the course, but it will not be used in the calculation of your GPA. A grade of U will reflect attempted credit that was not earned in the course, but it will not affect the GPA.

Students may select the S/U grading option for most courses that are graded. Keep in mind that most labs are linked directly to the course. If you are registered for a lab that is graded separately and does not require you to be registered simultaneously to the lecture, then the option will exist.

OPTING IN AND WITHDRAWAL
I am considering opting-in for an S/U grade for a class. How should I proceed?
Read through these FAQs, review your graduate program handbook, and schedule an appointment to speak with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director for guidance. Some programs have requirements that limit you to letter grades (e.g., accreditation standards; minimum letter grade requirements) for certain classes. Additionally, some programs have strict rules about dismissal for “U” grades that you should consider as you make this choice.

I am in provisional admission status, on probation or on a conditional retention plan. Can I choose S/U grading?
Yes, but it is important to consider the implications of your choice. If you were admitted provisionally or are currently on probation or a Conditional Retention Plan, you should contact the student services team in Graduate Studies (email gradrcrd@ucf.edu) about your specific situation before opting in.

How does a student opt-in? By what deadline?
Students will opt-in by completing an online request form. When available, students will opt-in using the self-service option in myUCF. Navigate to my.UCF.edu > Student Self Service > Student Center > Other Academic (dropdown menu) > COVID-19 S/U Option. The decision to opt-in should be made in consultation with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director as soon as possible. The S/U opt-in period will begin April 10; the last day to opt-in is April 27.

Can I withdraw from a class instead of opting-in for an S/U?
You can withdraw from a class until Monday, April 20.

What happens if I don’t opt-in for an S/U?
You will receive the letter grade you earn for your class(es).

How does my decision to opt-in for a S/U grading impact my financial aid and/or satisfactory academic progress (SAP)?
Information about the impact of S/U grading on financial aid will be given prior to April 10. Please pay attention to your knights.ucf.edu email for the information.

Will opting-in for S/U grades affect my tuition reimbursement from my employer? What about my scholarship?
It is important that you check with your employer or scholarship award PRIOR to opting in for S/U grading. Some employers and scholarships will only pay if you earn letter grades in your courses.

Is the request form available yet?
The online form is not yet available. It will be available April 10. Students will be notified when this online form is available.

COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND CONTINUED STUDIES
Are there any classes that are not eligible for S/U grading?
Most classes are eligible for the Spring 2020 S/U opt-in policy. There are only a few exemptions that have been approved. Without a special exemption from the university, your faculty advisor or graduate program director cannot prevent you from opting in for S/U grading. Instead, their role is to advise you on what they think are the potential consequences of your choice. You are encouraged to seek their advice, but the ultimate decision is yours.

If I am taking a class that is a pre-requisite, how will an S/U impact my ability to register for the next class?
Some courses require a set letter grade in the pre-requisite for it to count. An S/U grade could negatively impact your academic progress in that degree program. It is important for you to consult with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director to understand the impact of the S/U election on required pre-requisites.

I am a graduate student who is enrolled in an undergraduate class as a pre-requisite for my graduate program and I am expecting a C grade in this class. If I choose the S/U option, will I receive an S or a U?
S/U grading is linked to your status as a graduate student. Thus, any grade of C that you earn, regardless of the level of class you are taking, will be evaluated using the graduate S/U conversion. Any C grade you earn will be converted to a U grade.

How does a U grade impact my GPA or academic standing?
An unsatisfactory (U) grade will not impact your GPA, but it may impact your academic standing. In general, receiving more than 6 credits of U grades can result in dismissal. Some programs have more strict standards, so you should refer to your graduate program handbook for information about how a U grade may impact your academic standing.

How would choosing S/U grading impact me if I’m part of a special population or cohort such as international students, veterans, student athletes, etc?
Please contact the appropriate resource office to anticipate the impact:

Student Athletes	Academic Services for Student Athletes (ASSA)	407-823-5895 or assa@ucf.edu
International Students	UCF Global	407-823-2337
Veterans	Veterans Academic Resource Center (VARC)	407-823-2707 or varc@ucf.edu
Financial Aid	Office of Student Financial Assistance	407-823-2827 or finaid@ucf.edu
I expect to earn a C (or C-/C+) in a class. What should I do?
This may be a difficult decision to make depending on your circumstances, so we recommend that you discuss this with your faculty advisor, graduate program director, college graduate advising office and/or the College of Graduate Studies. Failure to discuss your options with a knowledgeable advisor could result in making a choice that will negatively impact your academic progress in your program.

If I already withdrew, will I be able to reinstate in a course now that the opportunity to earn a U exists?
Students who request a withdrawal reversal already have the ability to do so within 3 business days from the date you withdrew. However, the request to reverse the withdrawal in this case must occur no later than Wednesday, April 22.

If I am graduating this semester, how will S/U affect me in a class I need to pass to graduate? How will it affect my GPA?
Remember that S/U grades do not change your GPA. They only reflect credit earned or not earned. For instance, if you are in your last semester and need specific letter grades to get or keep your GPA above 3.0, then the S/U grade will not be a good choice for you. If your GPA is already above 3.0 and you just need the credits to complete your degree, then the S/U grade might be something to consider. It is important to understand and review your degree audit and situation with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director so that you can make an informed choice.

How will S/U grades this semester be explained when I have my transcript sent to another professional or graduate school?
The back of the transcripts contains a legend detailing grades. Transcripts will indicate that the S/U option was made available this semester because of the pandemic. Additional information will be available at registrar.ucf.edu. If you are a graduate certificate or master’s degree student wishing to apply to another graduate degree program, you should talk with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director for information about how choosing S/U grades may impact your chances of being admitted in other graduate programs or how choosing S/U grades might impact the course transfers to those programs.

How will U grades impact my graduate assistantship?
Graduate assistantship students are expected to maintain good academic standing. Speak with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director if you have questions about how receiving a U grade could impact your funding.

How will U grades impact my university fellowship?
Most university fellowships require students to receive satisfactory grades in all classes (unsatisfactory grades are C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, NC and U). If you have questions about how a U grade could impact your graduate fellowship, email gradfellowship@ucf.edu.

Would I have to use grade forgiveness later if I choose to repeat a course in which I received a U grade?
No. Grade forgiveness is not available to graduate students.

Would repeating a course in which I received a U be considered as a second attempt?
Yes. U grades means that you did not earn credit for the course. If it is a required or core course in your plan of study, it would have to be repeated. If it is an elective course, then you could choose to repeat the elective course or you could pick a different elective from those allowed as part of the degree. You would still need to meet the necessary elective credit hour requirement for your degree plan of study.

Can I appeal my decision to receive an S/U for a class?
Appeals to reverse your request for an S/U will not be allowed.

Please consult with your faculty advisor and/or graduate program director before making any decisions regarding your academic plan.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/finding-hope-during-covid-19/,3-Apr-2020,"This has undoubtedly been a trying time for the UCF community.

COVID-19 is impacting us all in some way, and public health officials are advising that the worst may be yet to come.

Still, I’ve been inspired by the bravery and humanity I’ve seen from so many. From my health care peers working on the frontlines to the restaurant workers and store employees sustaining us to our own faculty and staff helping our students navigate stress and focus on their academic success — there is much to be hopeful about.

Another positive: Next week, a COVID-19 drive-through testing site will open at UCF in partnership with Aventus Biolabs.

Public health officials say that more widespread testing is key in getting the nation back to “normal,” and this is an opportunity for UCF to contribute to that cause.

 

About the Testing Site
Starting Monday, COVID-19 tests will be available to all members of the community with an appointment on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or until appointments are filled. The drive-through tests will be administered in Garage A.

Patients must be screened for symptoms by a healthcare provider before a test can be prescribed to those who qualify.

UCF students can obtain an ordered test from Student Health Services telehealth by calling 407-823-2701. UCF faculty and staff members can obtain their ordered test from their primary care provider or by contacting UCF Health at 407-266-3627. Aventus also can connect anyone with a telehealth provider by calling 855-282-4860.

After the patient has been screened by a provider, Aventus will reach out to complete all necessary paperwork and schedule an appointment for testing. Upon arrival during a scheduled time, individuals will drive through and receive the testing with a swab designated specifically for them. Following the 10-minute test, they’ll receive results in 24 to 48 hours.

Learn more about the testing process.

 

UCF Gives Back
The UCF community is making many other contributions to the battle against COVID-19.

Earlier this week, UCF employees came through in a big way, gathering masks, gloves, goggles and other medical equipment from labs and departments and donating them to hospitals. These supplies will help sustain our local hospitals as they manage the expected surge of ill patients in the weeks to come.

The team at Limbitless Solutions also is helping medical workers by creating 3D printed visors, a piece of the disposable face shields these workers desperately need.

Workers like UCF alumna Jessica Goldonowicz DeSalvo, an emergency medicine physician who shared her powerful story about waiting for the “tsunami” of COVID-19 to hit as a way to encourage people to stay home and help reduce further spread of the virus.

There are countless other projects underway by UCF students and faculty and staff members to assist with this pandemic and its impact in a variety of ways. I know our entire community appreciates these efforts.

Each of us can do our part by taking COVID-19 seriously and doing everything in our power to reduce further spread. Continue practicing social distancing and taking personal health precautions, including practicing proper hand-washing and avoiding touching your face and frequently touched surfaces.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/ucf-housing-begins-issuing-refunds/,3-Apr-2020,"The Department of Housing and Residence Life will begin issuing housing refunds for a portion of the spring semester’s rent to residents that were not able to return to campus or have left their rooms, at the direction of the university in response to COVID-19.

Housing rent refunds will be prorated from March 27, 2020 through April 28, 2020. This represents approximately 25% of the spring semester.

If housing costs were paid with a credit card, the refund will go back on the credit card. Any unpaid charges owed to the university will be deducted from your housing refund. Refunds will be posted to eligible students’ accounts and will show in myUCF. If you have a direct deposit account set up, your refund will be deposited there. If not, it is strongly recommended that you enroll in direct deposit. Find instructions on how to set up a direct deposit.

If you haven’t set up direct deposit before housing refunds are posted, checks will be sent to your mailing address on file with UCF. You are encouraged to verify the address on file and to update if necessary. Verify or update your mailing address by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, clicking Student Center, and reviewing the Personal Information section.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/families-first-coronavirus-response-act-emergency-leave/,31-Mar-2020,"The impact of COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way all of us operate. For some of you, navigating the responsibilities of work while also caring for your families or your own health has made the transition particularly difficult.

On Wednesday, April 1, new federal legislation takes effect that could bring some relief.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) may provide you and other UCF employees with additional benefits. The Act focuses on two areas: emergency paid sick leave and emergency family and medical leave. The Act is effective from April 1 through December 31, 2020 and provides limited leave benefits to eligible employees.

 

Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL)
Beginning April 1, UCF will provide eligible employees with Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL). The EPSL may be used if an employee is unable to work (or work remotely) for one of several COVID-19 related reasons. Eligible full-time employees may be paid for up to 80 hours of EPSL. Eligible part-time employees will receive EPSL based on the average number of hours they work within a two-week period.

Eligible UCF employees will be automatically granted EPSL and can utilize this benefit by indicating the qualifying reason on their timesheet or LAPER in coordination with their department leave practices.

 

Emergency Family and Medical Leave (EFMLA)
In addition, eligible UCF employees can apply for Emergency Family and Medical Leave (EFMLA) if an employee is unable to work (or work remotely) because they are caring for their minor child, if the child’s school or child care provider is closed or unavailable due to the COVID-19 emergency.

The first ten days of emergency FMLA leave will be unpaid, but EPSL or regular accrued leave can be used during this period. After that, eligible employees will receive up to 2/3 of their regular pay for up to 10 weeks, for the number of hours that the employee would normally be scheduled to work. EFMLA claims will count towards the regular, annual FMLA limit of twelve work weeks.

 

Additional Information
Our current circumstances have forced us all to make big adjustments to our routines, including how we teach and work. We are in this together, and we hope these emergency provisions bring some help to those who need it. As a reminder, faculty, A&P, and USPS staff whose circumstances do not qualify for the FFCRA emergency leave provisions, and who are unable to work remotely during the Orange County Stay at Home Order, will be paid administrative leave from March 27 through April 9.

To learn more about UCF’s implementation of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, including whether you are eligible, what circumstances qualify for emergency leave, and what you need to do to request Emergency FMLA, please go to: hr.ucf.edu/families-first-coronavirus-response-act/.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/letter-to-off-campus-housing-managers/,31-Mar-2020,"Dear Off-Campus Student Housing Managers, 

As you know, our world has changed drastically in recent weeks due to COVID-19. Businesses have been shuttered and communities ordered to “stay at home” to slow the spread of this virus. We’ve seen big changes at the University of Central Florida, too. As directed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State University System, we’ve shifted all classes online for the spring and at least a portion of the summer semesters. In addition, we’ve intentionally depopulated campus by requesting our students return to their permanent residences. 

UCF has now begun processing refunds for on-campus student housing for a portion of the spring semester, and we also are working to provide relief for students who purchased meal plans. 

Your business is undoubtedly feeling the effects of this pandemic, even as you continue to support UCF and our students. We’re thankful to have you as a valued partner. At the same time, we know that many of our students are struggling as they navigate stress caused by the uncertainty of the pandemic; new virtual coursework; isolation from friends and social activities; and financial hardships from the loss of jobs and internships. We’ve heard from some students whose parents are guarantors on their lease and also now find themselves unexpectedly out of work. 

That’s why we are respectfully asking apartment and housing managers in the UCF area to work with our off-campus students on a case-by-case basis. Please consider granting early lease terminations and flexibility with rent payment plans, security deposits and guarantees. 

For those students who remain on your properties, we ask that you promote social distancing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In accordance with Orange County’s mandatory “Stay at Home” Executive Order, residents are ordered to stay at home as much as possible, with exceptions for trips deemed “essential.” Please discourage gatherings in your community spaces and help prevent parties from being hosted on your property.

Thank you for your consideration of our request and your continued support of UCF and our students. We know that by working together, we will all get through this. 

Sincerely, 

Thad Seymour Jr.

Grit, perseverance, determination, resilience. Whatever you call it, we are a community that always finds a way to overcome every obstacle and move forward. And we’ve faced an unprecedented challenge these past few weeks with COVID-19.

I know these are extremely difficult times for everyone. Because we’re not just professionals. We’re parents. We’re caregivers. We’re neighbors.

I just want to say how proud I am of our faculty and staff members, who, at the same time they’re taking care of our students, also are taking care of their families and loved ones.

Remote Working Update
As Wednesday’s UCF Alert said, the period of remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

For everyone’s health and safety, buildings will be locked to all employees, with the exception of those who have been approved by their dean or vice president as being critical to the university’s continued operation. These employees include: first responders, healthcare professionals, supply chain personnel, critical infrastructure support personnel, approved researchers and instructors, and certain contractors.

Employees who have this designation know it and have already had appropriate discussions with their supervisors. Employees who don’t fall into these categories should continue working remotely.

Also starting today through April 9, UCF will provide paid administrative leave to employees who are unable to work on campus and unable to work remotely. This leave applies to faculty, administrative and USPS employees.

We hope this will help with the financial strain the pandemic has caused so many in our campus community whose jobs don’t translate to remote work.

Families First Coronavirus Response Act
Starting April 1, when the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act takes effect, faculty and staff — along with eligible OPS employees — may qualify for emergency leave.

All other faculty, administrative and USPS employees who do not qualify for the federal aid and who cannot work remotely will be provided administrative leave through April 9.

Employees not available for work due to illness or personal time must take sick or annual leave per UCF policy.
UCF HR will share more detailed guidance about the federal legislation and will continue to provide updates directly to departments via each office’s HR liaison.

Ingenuity and Compassion
At Tuesday’s Board of Trustees meeting, I shared the ingenuity of our faculty members and our Division of Digital Learning team. In one week, they helped transition nearly 5,000 face-to-face course sections to remote delivery, and helped our faculty members convert another 700 mixed-mode sections fully online.

In the past week, I’ve also heard many stories of our community’s compassion and creativity. Among the many examples, professors and staff are sewing masks for our healthcare providers and developing free educational podcasts for teachers and families caring for people with disabilities in a new world of virtual learning.

Our lives have been disrupted, and we’ve taken a path none of us could have predicted. But seeing the grit and care shown by our faculty and staff, I’m confident we will get through this, together.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/spring-2020-s-u-grading-policy-faqs/,27-Mar-2020,"In response to students’ requests, UCF will offer undergraduates the option to select a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grade or a letter grade for eligible Spring 2020 courses. Students will be able to choose this option from April 10 – 27. Transcripts will indicate that the S/U option was made available this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is critical to understand how S/U grading may affect you. It is imperative to contact your advisor before making a grading decision. In some instances, an S/U grade may impact financial aid, degree program requirements and applications to graduate or professional school.

GRADING SYSTEM AND GPAs
 

What is UCF’s grading system?
UCF uses an alphabetic, plus/minus system to identify student grades and other actions regarding student progress or class attendance as outlined below. Refer to the Undergraduate Catalog for detailed information.

Grades	Grading Points Per Semester Hour of Credit
A	4.00
A-	3.75
B+	3.25
B	3.00
B-	2.75
C+	2.25
C	2.00
C-	1.75
D+	1.25
D	1.00
D-	.75
F	0.00
NC	No Credit (replaces the use of D+, D and D- in certain cases)
S	Satisfactory (with credit) satisfactory progress
U	Unsatisfactory (no credit) unsatisfactory progress
If you choose to select courses for S/U grading, those selected courses with grades that are equivalent to A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+ or C grades will convert to a satisfactory (S) grade. Grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F or NC will convert to an unsatisfactory (U) grade.

How does S/U grading impact GPAs?
Grades of S and U do not impact the GPA. A grade of S will result in credit for the course, but it will not be used in the calculation of the GPA. A grade of U will reflect attempted credit that was not earned in the course, but it will not affect the GPA.

How does an unsatisfactory grade impact my GPA or academic standing? 
A U grade will not impact your GPA, nor does it affect academic standing.

If I am graduating this semester, how will S/U affect me in a class I need to pass to graduate? How will it affect my GPA? 
It is essential to understand and review your degree audit and situation with your department or college advisor.

OPTING IN AND WITHDRAWAL
I am considering opting-in for an S/U grade for a class. How should I proceed? 
Read these FAQs and schedule an appointment to speak with your department or college advisor for guidance.

How do I opt-in to S/U grading? What’s the deadline?
You will complete an online request form using the self-service option in myUCF. Here are the steps you need to take:

Consult with your advisor as soon as possible.
Between April 10 to 27, submit your request for S/U grading. Go to the myUCF portal and select Student Self Service > Student Center > Other Academic (dropdown menu) > COVID-19 S/U Option.
Opt-in no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 27.
When will the request form be available?
The form will be available by April 10. UCF will notify you when it’s available.

What happens if I don’t opt-in for an S/U? 
You will receive the letter grade you earn for your class(es).

Can I withdraw from a class instead of opting-in for an S/U? 
Yes, you can withdraw from a class until Monday, April 20.

If I withdraw from a class, will I have an opportunity to reinstate in a course now that the opportunity to earn a U exists? 
Typically, you must request a withdrawal reversal within three business days from the date you withdrew. For Spring 2020, the request to reverse the withdrawal must occur no later than Wednesday, April 22.

COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND CONTINUED STUDIES
Are there any classes that are not eligible for S/U grading? 
Some classes may not be eligible for S/U grading. Information regarding UCF’s Spring 2020 S/U opt-in policy is forthcoming. You should seek guidance regarding this matter from faculty members and advisors.

 Can I choose an S/U grade for labs?
Most labs are associated with a course. You can select S/U grading if a lab is graded separately and does not require simultaneous registration in a lecture.

If I am taking a prerequisite class, will an S/U grade impact my ability to register for the next course? 
If your degree program requires a grade of a C or higher to advance to the next class, selecting the S/U option for the prerequisite may be inadvisable.

Does S/U grading impact students in special populations or cohorts?
You must contact the program office to determine how S/U grading will affect you.

How will my BHC University Honors status be determined based on Spring 2020 grades?

Good standing will be determined by using the UCF cumulative GPA and UCF Honors cumulative GPA as calculated by UCF after Spring 2020 grades are posted.
Students currently in good standing who achieve less than a 3.2 UCF cumulative GPA and/or a 3.0 cumulative Honors GPA after Spring 2020 grades are posted will receive a warning letter instead of being placed on probation.
Students currently on honors probation who achieve less than a 3.2 UCF term GPA and/or a 3.0 cumulative term GPA after Spring 2020 grades are posted will be placed on extended probation, instead of being removed from university honors.
Students graduating in Spring 2020 are expected to meet honors graduation requirements to graduate with university honors:
3.2 UCF cumulative GPA
3.0 honors cumulative GPA
Satisfactory completion of a minimum of eight BHC Honors courses as outlined on the BHC website 
BHC courses with grades of S will count toward the eight-course requirement.
Will selecting the S/U grading option impact my application to graduate or professional school? 
Please contact the graduate or professional program to which you are applying or the appropriate UCF resource office to discuss the possible impact of an S or U grade on your graduate or professional school application.

College of Graduate Studies at 407-823-2766 (for referrals and advice from comparable programs at UCF)
Will selecting S/U grading impact my financial aid and/or satisfactory academic progress (SAP)? 
S, U and NC grades could help you maintain your current GPA because it won’t change it. S grades may also help you meet the earned hours requirements. However, a U or NC grade would not help you meet the earned hours requirement nor the SAP completion percentage standard.

How will Spring 2020 S/U grades appear on my transcript sent to professional and graduate schools? 
The back of transcripts contains a legend detailing grades. Spring 2020 transcripts will indicate that the S/U grade option was offered this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

How will S/U grades be reviewed by Bright Futures or other scholarships that require a GPA and credit requirement? 
U grades will not negatively impact your GPA, and you will not receive credit. S grades also do not affect your GPA, and you will receive credit for completing the course.

I received a U grade in a class, would I have to use grade forgiveness to repeat it later?
No.

Would repeating a course in which I received a U be considered a second attempt? 
Yes.

Will an S grade meet Gordon Rule Writing, Math, Civic Literacy and State Core requirements? 
Yes.

Can I complete my Gordon Rule classes with a C-?
Yes. But these courses (courses where a C- is earned) are not eligible for the S/U option.

What tools do I use to help me make registration decisions for the Summer 2020, Fall 2020 and Spring 2021?
Continue to use the Pegasus Path, myKnight Audit and mySchedule Builder to make registration decisions.

Can I appeal my decision to receive an S/U for a class? 
Appeals to reverse your request for an S/U will not be allowed. Before you select S/U grading, consult with a faculty member or your academic advisor.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/a-caring-community/,27-Mar-2020,"This is an unprecedented time for our society and for all of us at UCF, both personally and professionally. We have asked a lot from you, and I am grateful for the way you have worked thoughtfully, creatively, and hard to help our students succeed. Thank you.

I am writing to give an update, but more importantly to acknowledge the critical need to care for our students and one another during these extraordinary circumstances.

This is a very difficult time for many of our students. They are frightened for their health and for their loved ones. Many have lost employment or are worried about how they can continue their education. Some are worried about housing and even finding sufficient food. Balancing family obligations with their education is even more difficult. Please have empathy and compassion for your students. Listen to their fears and concerns. Help them know of your sincere interest in their well-being, and encourage them as much as you can.

Many of us feel the same anxiety about health and loved ones, and for the future. On top of that, the emotional labor of responding to your students’ very real difficulties can take a toll. Please take good care of yourselves and your colleagues. Please let your chairs, deans, Faculty Excellence, and me know what you need. Email me if you need to talk. And if it can be helpful, please remember that you can take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program.

Those of you on the tenure track may freely ask for a tenure clock extension as a result of the turmoil caused by the pandemic. All requests will be granted.

Remote teaching will continue through the spring semester and into Summer A, C and D. A decision has not been made about Summer B. We have sought to alleviate student stress by giving students the option of choosing S/U grading this spring.

I hope that all of you know of the online resources available, such as the Keeping Teaching website for faculty and the Keep Learning website for students, to help. We have also created a Faculty Toolkit with FAQs and other resources. For the most up-to-date information about the coronavirus developments at UCF, along with more general FAQs for employees, see the UCF Coronavirus website.

We are confronted by extraordinary challenges. More are likely to develop. But I have been lifted up by the response of our faculty and staff these past two weeks. I do believe that, working together, we will continue to hold one another close and serve our students well.

Please stay safe.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/refunds-approved-for-ucf-on-campus-housing/,27-Mar-2020,"A plan to refund housing costs was unanimously approved on Thursday by the university’s Board of Trustees in light of the unprecedented need to ask students not to return to campus to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Refunds will go to students with leases in the Apollo, Libra, Lake Claire, Nike, Hercules and Neptune communities, as well as Towers and Rosen housing. The refunds will include students’ housing costs from March 27 through April 28, the end of the spring semester.

The university also is in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest — which are managed by UCF but privately owned. Details are still being worked out, but both are supportive of offering partial refunds for the spring term.

Students still living on campus as of March 27 will not receive refunds.

In addition, UCF continues to advocate on behalf of our students who reside in privately owned student apartments off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to these individual off-campus properties and management companies.

Refunds will be processed beginning next week.

If housing costs were paid with a credit card, the refund will go back on the credit card. If not, refunds will be posted in eligible students’ accounts and will be shown in myUCF. Most students have their student account linked to a bank through direct deposit. Students who do not have direct deposit are encouraged to sign up by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, and clicking Direct Deposit.

Students who haven’t set up direct deposit before refunds are posted will have checks sent to their mailing address on file with UCF. Students are encouraged to verify the address on file is correct, and to update it if it’s not. Verify or update your mailing address by logging in to myUCF, clicking Student Accounts, clicking Student Center, and reviewing the Personal Information section.

Any unpaid charges owed to the university will be deducted from students’ refunds.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/s-u-grade-option-update-student-withdrawal-deadline-now-april-20/,26-Mar-2020,"Yesterday, UCF announced a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading option that students can choose for their classes. This decision was made after consultation with deans and faculty members because we understand the added stress the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on our students.

Most students will be able to select the S/U option on a course-by-course basis.

Choosing this option may not be wise for students in all circumstances. For example, there may be issues associated with financial aid, meeting major requirements, etc. We are developing additional information to help students decide and to help advisors answer student questions before the opt-in period begins in April.

The S/U grades will not affect GPAs. The grade designation will appear on students’ transcripts with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are continuing to work through the details of providing this option—including determining the period for students to opt-in. Students and faculty and staff members can expect to hear more in the coming weeks.

For now, we are happy to share that this will be an option for our students. UCF is committed to student success, and it is critical that UCF supports our students during this challenging time.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/taking-care-of-our-knights/,25-Mar-2020,"Over the past two weeks, we’ve sent you a lot of information, and you may be feeling confused or overwhelmed. But if there’s one thing I hope has been clear in each message, it’s this: We care about you and want you to stay safe.

Like other college students across the country, you’ve been grappling with the stress of juggling new assignments online, or moving back home, or losing a job, or trying to pay rent, or taking care of family members.

You’ve heard these are unprecedented times — and that you need to take this virus seriously to protect yourself, your friends and your loved ones. That’s one reason Orange County enacted its “stay at home” order for the next two weeks beginning Thursday. That means only going out for essential things like trips to the grocery store, and not to friends’ apartments for dinner.

The strain of all of this is wearing. But we want to help you keep going, and help you take care of yourself not just academically but personally. We will emerge from this COVID-19 crisis — and I know the same grit and determination that resonates with all of us in Knight Nation will help us get through the challenging times ahead.

New Updates on Semester Grading
We’ve heard from students who’ve requested a pass-fail grading option because of this semester’s significant disruptions and worked with academic and faculty leaders across campus to best support students during this difficult time. We’ve also heard from many who are concerned about not receiving a letter grade for their work.

That’s why students will have the option to select — for each of their Spring 2020 courses — whether they would like a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade or a letter grade. This option will be available for students in most undergraduate and graduate programs, except medical students.

Details are still being finalized, but we want you to know that most of you will be able to make this choice. There are important factors to consider when making this decision, and we’ll soon be sharing that and more information about how and when you can select your grading preference.

Ultimately, we hope giving you this option will help ease some of the academic stress you’ve faced with the transition to remote learning.

And for those looking for additional resources to help with their new course formats, we have some helpful tips.

Student Support Services
Along with the switch to remote learning, many of our student support services also have moved online.

For any student who needs it, you can schedule a phone or virtual consultation with UCF’s Counseling and Psychological Services by calling 407-823-2811 or visiting their website.

Student Care Services also continues to work remotely with anyone who needs additional academic or personal support during this time. You also can call Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

And you can learn about more virtual student services, including virtual and livestreaming fitness classes, on our UCF Coronavirus website.

Need Groceries?
UCF’s Knights Helping Knights Pantry is offering students to-go bags with up to 10 food and toiletry items for curbside pickup. If you’re interested in this service, please fill out this form to order a bag.

Curbside pickup is available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the loading dock behind the Knights Pantry in parking lot B9.

Commencement
Our graduating seniors and their families will be happy to know that we have continued to explore alternative ways of celebrating this important milestone.

While UCF — like all other state universities — will not be hosting in-person commencement ceremonies this spring, we will be organizing a virtual commencement for our spring graduates. Details are being worked out and will be shared soon.

Additionally, we are looking at ways to recognize this semester’s graduates at a special rescheduled ceremony later this year. More information on that will come later.

Housing and Refunds
Finally, I want to end with an update related to many questions we have received regarding refunds for on-campus students’ housing and meal plans.

This is an area our team has been extensively working on during the past week. Our Board of Trustees tomorrow will be considering options for refunding a portion of spring housing costs for on-campus student residents. This would include residence halls and housing communities on the main campus and at the Rosen College. We are in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest, and both are supportive of offering partial refunds for the spring term.

UCF is advocating on behalf of our students who reside off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to individual off-campus properties and management companies.

We also hope to have more information to share soon with our students who have purchased meal plans about credits that may be available to them for future use.

These and other important updates will continue to be posted to the UCF Coronavirus website. I encourage you to check it frequently for the latest information and resources to help you during this difficult time.

While we all need to continue practicing social distancing, we also must keep reaching out (virtually) and supporting each other. We have an incredible team of faculty members, administrators, student support staff, advisors, counselors and others who are 100 percent committed to helping you.

And I could not be prouder of how our campus community continues to respond in this most challenging time.

Because together we will … Charge On!

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/how-the-new-student-s-u-grade-option-affects-faculty/,25-Mar-2020,"All of us care deeply about our students’ well-being and success. Juggling education, jobs and job loss, family responsibilities, and concerns about the future has become a struggle for many of our students. To alleviate student stress, and after consultation with deans and the Faculty Senate leadership, we have developed a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading option that students can choose for their classes. Today, Interim President Seymour announced this option to students. I am writing to explain what this means for you with more specifics to follow in coming days.

Students will be able to elect satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in any course. Faculty members will continue to assign grades as outlined in the syllabi. At the end of the semester, the grades you submit will be converted by the Registrar’s Office to either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, for students selecting this option. The grade designation will appear on their transcript with an annotation that the S/U option was offered this spring semester because of the pandemic.

Choosing this option might not be wise for a student in all circumstances. For example, there may be issues associated with financial aid, meeting major requirements, etc. We are developing information about these matters to help students decide, and to help advisors answer student questions. It will be important for students to discuss the option with advisors. This information will be available to students and advisors before the opt-in period begins.

In brief, this is how opt-in for students will work:

Undergraduate and graduate students may opt in to S/U grading and may choose during a yet-to-be-determined time in April;
Students may choose course-by-course;
S/U grades will have no effect on GPA;
Courses with “S” grades will count toward degree requirements, but not necessarily toward majors (if, for example, a “B” is required in a certain course in an undergraduate major);
For students who opt in to S/U grading:
Undergraduate grades of “A” through “C” will be replaced by “S;” “C-” and below will be replaced by “U;”
Graduate grades of “A” through “B-” will be replaced by “S;” “C+” and below will be replaced by “U.”
In a very few cases, certain courses may be excluded from this opportunity. I am in discussion with deans about this and other finer details. In addition, the M.D. program, which is on a different academic calendar, is excluded from this program.

More details are coming soon about how students can opt in, deadlines, etc., along with information for students about pros and cons.

The opt-in choice for students recognizes the very difficult time that they and all of us face and upholds UCF’s commitment to student success. I deeply appreciate the adjustments you have made in short order to keep advancing teaching and learning at UCF while navigating the personal challenges of your own. More about supporting faculty during this challenging time will come soon. Thank you.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/orange-county-announces-stay-at-home-order/,25-Mar-2020,"Orange County is mandating an emergency “stay at home” order that takes effect at 11 p.m. Thursday, March 26, for at least two weeks through 11 p.m. Thursday, April 9. This is an expansion of the previously announced curfew in Orange County and is a concerted effort to reduce further spread of COVID-19.

The order applies to all individuals within Orange County, with exceptions for essential workers and essential activities as outlined in the order. Frequently asked questions are addressed here: newsroom.ocfl.net/2020/03/stay-at-home-to-flatten-the-curve-orange-county-issues-stay-at-home-order-effective-march-26-2020-faqs.

UCF has taken strategic actions to depopulate the campus over the past several weeks.

By tonight, students who reside in UCF Housing should have returned to their permanent residences. Those with extenuating circumstances remaining on campus and students in off-campus housing must abide by the order. Students currently off campus should not return to UCF until further notice.

The period of remote work for employees will continue until further notice.

Starting Friday, March 27, only those employees who have been identified as essential; whose job functions require them to report to campus; and whose supervisors have approved them continuing to work on campus should be at UCF. Only essential employees who meet all three of these criteria will have key card access to campus buildings.  If you are unsure about how this applies to you, talk to your supervisor about what the “stay at home” order entails.

Starting Friday, March 27, through April 9, UCF will provide paid administrative leave to employees who are unable to work on campus and unable to work remotely. This leave applies to faculty, administrative and USPS employees. Beginning April 1, when the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act takes effect, faculty and staff—along with eligible OPS employees—may qualify for emergency leave. All other faculty, administrative, and USPS employees who do not qualify for the federal aid and who cannot work remotely will be provided administrative leave. Employees not available for work due to illness or personal time must take sick or annual leave per UCF policy.

More detailed guidance about the federal legislation will be shared soon with employees, supervisors and HR liaisons.

Additionally, the Office of Research had earlier this month identified and approved researchers who could continue to have limited access to their labs. In response to the “stay at home” order, the list will be further reduced to only allow access to personnel critical to maintaining facility operations. Those individuals will be selected by their college deans or directors and approved by the Vice President of Research. More information will be forthcoming.

We understand that this is a stressful time for you, and we care about your well-being. We also appreciate your patience as we make decisions that prioritize everyone’s safety.

Since sharing recent updates related to Housing, we’ve received many questions from our residents and their families. We’re providing some additional clarity and updated information.

Refunds
We understand the financial stress and uncertainty COVID-19 has caused so many of our students and their families.

Because of that, UCF’s Board of Trustees later this week will be considering options for refunding a portion of spring housing costs for student residents. This would include residence halls and housing communities on the main campus and Rosen. We are in discussions with the owners of NorthView and UnionWest — which are managed by UCF but privately owned — regarding refunds.

Once these decisions are reached, we will share this information with our students, as well as continued ways the university will support them in this difficult time.

Residents Who Haven’t Returned
Residents who have not returned to campus since UCF moved to remote instruction following spring break should not come back to campus right now.

These residents will receive instructions about completing their move out at a different time. Their belongings are safe, and no new residents will be moved into their spaces.

At this time, public health officials are advising against any non-essential travel, so residents should not be coming to campus to move out of residence halls. Move out for these residents will be scheduled at a time when risks associated with the further spread of COVID-19 are minimized.

Residents Still on Campus With No Summer Agreement
Residents physically remaining on campus with no summer agreement need to vacate their room by 6 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, unless they are granted an exemption.

These residents should visit the Housing Portal in myUCF to sign up for an appointment time and follow the move out instructions below.

Residents Still on Campus With Summer Agreements
Residents physically remaining on campus with a summer agreement still need to vacate their room by 6 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, unless they are granted an exception.

These residents should visit the Housing Portal in myUCF to sign up for an appointment time and follow the move out instructions below.

At this time, Housing does not know the status of residents’ ability to return for campus for the summer. They are encouraged to use their best judgement on whether to take all belongings, especially if it could be a hardship to get them at a later date.

Instructions for Move Out
Move out for the residents remaining on campus has been structured to allow for social distancing best practices to reduce further spread of COVID-19.

Residents must adhere to the two-hour move out time they selected in the Housing Portal. No more than two people should assist, and it’s especially important that residents not bring anyone who is sick or who has a compromised immune system with them.

Once all belongings have been removed, residents should go to the designated location for key drop-off. Key envelopes will be available, and residents should write their name, PID and room number on the envelope; place their room and mailbox keys inside; and drop the envelope in the key box.

After the resident has removed all their belongings and dropped off their keys, they should complete the Express Check Out Form in the Housing Portal to confirm that they have vacated the space.

Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
We are working quickly to review requests for exemptions also submitted through the Housing Portal for international students unable to travel; residents without permanent housing; and those with other hardships. Please know these are being handled on a case-by-case basis.

These residents will hear directly from Housing about whether they are approved to remain. They may be required to consolidate in a different location on campus, and campus services — including housekeeping — will be extremely limited. Residents who have requested an exception may remain in their space until a decision is rendered, and additional time to move out will be given if a request is denied.

More information will be shared as soon as possible, and residents requesting exceptions should stay tuned to their email.

Off-Campus Housing
Students who live in off-campus housing should contact their individual leasing office for more information.

This also applies to residents in affiliated housing at Knights Circle and the Pointe at Central. While UCF provides residence life services at these properties, respective management companies control leases and payment systems.

UCF is advocating on behalf of our students who reside off campus. Ultimately, any decisions about refunds will be up to individual properties and management companies.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-case-confirmed-at-ucf/,20-Mar-2020,"Today, UCF learned that one of our students has tested positive for COVID-19.

The incubation period for COVID-19 is 14 days, and we believe the risk of anyone who came into contact with him developing symptoms at this point is very low. Out of an abundance of caution, his residence hall and classrooms will be decontaminated for everyone’s safety.

The student is recovering away from UCF, and he has our best wishes for good health.

Additionally, a military contractor who works at the Partnership IV Building in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the main campus has tested positive for the coronavirus. Several of his colleagues also have submitted to tests.

While a small number of UCF Institute for Simulation and Training employees work in the same building, they aren’t believed to have come into contact with the military contractor. The UCF employees have already been working remotely and have been advised to monitor their health. Partnership IV will be closed for two weeks following thorough decontamination.

UCF also is aware of other students who have exhibited symptoms and are being tested and observing self-quarantine. While we believe their risk is low, this is a wake-up call that COVID-19 is at UCF and all of us must be vigilant.

This news hits close to home for UCF. But we must understand that as testing becomes more widely available across Central Florida, the number of positive cases will grow.

The realities of this pandemic are why we have moved to remote instruction for all students and remote work for most employees. COVID-19 is something we must all take seriously.

Social distancing is key in reducing further spread of COVID-19. It’s also important to take personal health precautions, such as practicing proper hand-washing and avoiding touching your face and frequently-touched surfaces.

UCF leadership, including Interim President Thad Seymour, Jr., continues to make decisions in consultation with public health officials and state leaders that prioritize the health and safety of everyone at UCF and in our broader community.

We are sharing answers to frequently asked questions, and resources for help if this news is affecting you here.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/update-about-covid-19-impacts-at-ucf/,19-Mar-2020,"COVID-19 remains a global pandemic that we all must take seriously.

A new report from the CDC finds that 38 percent of hospitalized cases in the U.S. are 20- to 54-year-olds, further proof that we need everyone in our campus community — and beyond — prioritizing their personal wellness and practicing social distancing.

As we have done since January, UCF will continue to make decisions with the health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff members, and larger community top of mind, and we’ll communicate these updates to you as we have new information to share.

Academic Calendar and Summer Remote Instruction
Students and advisors should have received notice that UCF is postponing registration for the summer and fall semesters to Thursday, March 26. The withdrawal and reinstatement deadlines also have been extended to Friday, March 27.

These dates are reflected in the Academic Calendar.

Additionally, UCF will continue with remote instruction through the Summer A, C and D semesters, which all start on Monday, May 11.

While we don’t yet know the long-term impact of this pandemic, we wanted to make this decision well in advance of the start of those semesters to give our faculty members and students time to adjust their plans.

Additional information about courses will be shared with students by their college.

Housing
Students who live in residence halls were asked not to return to campus following Spring Break, and those remaining are strongly encouraged to return to their permanent residence as soon as possible. Special accommodations will be made for residents with extreme extenuating circumstances.

However, to ensure social distancing, no residents should formally move out immediately.

Instead, Housing will soon share a plan for staggered move-out appointments that prioritize the safety of students, their families, and staff members. More information will be emailed to residents by Housing in the coming days.

Remote Work for Employees
Whether employees are working remotely or reporting to campus to do your jobs, we want you to continue to work.

It is critical that supervisors and employees work together to identify meaningful work. Tasks might be different from normal responsibilities, but everyone must be creative and flexible, while also remaining mindful of social distancing.

Now is a great time to revisit useful training, including online training, that you couldn’t find the time for previously. Or, consider planning out projects, future events and other department priorities ahead of time. For those on campus, a good use of this time could include completing projects that are easier to do while the campus is depopulated.

This is an unprecedented time that requires outside-the-box thinking. Let’s all be creative with how we use this time to best position our respective areas for the future.

Stay Tuned
With this rapidly evolving situation, UCF continues to follow guidance from state and federal officials to make the best decisions.

UCF and the State University System Board of Governors are reviewing all student services and the impact of moving to an online platform. Since this event affects students, faculty, and staff across all of Florida, any operational and financial decisions are being made with the greatest concern to all impacted.

UCF will share more information about potential reimbursements as soon as it becomes available. We ask for continued patience as we all work through this very difficult and ever-changing situation.

As always, we are committed to sharing regular information at ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus. Please continue to check this site frequently for new updates or answers to common questions.

Last week, UCF encouraged all residential students to return to their permanent residence and not return to campus while keeping residence halls open as a last resort for residents who cannot leave. Because of Tuesday’s announcement that UCF is moving to remote instruction through the remainder of the spring semester, and in the interest of continued resident safety; it has become apparent that all students will need to vacate their room soon – you should not move at this time. Do not make arrangements to move out without additional guidance from housing and residence life. By the end of the week, residents will receive additional communication and guidance on how to properly move out.

Limited exceptions will be made for residents with the following extenuating circumstances:

International students unable to travel
Residents without permanent housing
Residents with other hardships to be reviewed on a case by case basis
Instructions on requesting an exception for an extenuating circumstance will be provided later this week.

We understand that this is a stressful time and care about your wellbeing. Because safety is priority, it is critical that students do not formally move out of their residence halls at this time. Housing and Residence Life has developed a move out plan that will encourage reduced interactions and social distancing during the process. It is imperative that residents and their families follow the instructions that will be provided at a later time and will include the selection of a move out appointment.

Public health officials have said that social distancing is critical in reducing further spread of COVID-19.

This is a period of dynamic change and unprecedented challenge. We must all remain flexible and look for creative solutions to navigate through this time.

Guidance for Supervisors and Employees
Remote instruction will continue through at least the spring semester. Faculty and staff who are working remotely should expect to continue to do so for the immediate weeks ahead.

However, UCF remains open, with employees on campus supporting remote learning, campus operations and other essential areas.

Not knowing the future impact of this pandemic, we understand that finding meaningful work that can be completed either on campus or remotely during this stretch of time can seem difficult. Supervisors are encouraged to find ways to fill employees’ time and keep them productive.

Supervisors should consider tasks that keep employees fully occupied while also exercising social distancing.

For example, for employees working on campus, that might be working on projects that are best completed when buildings are unoccupied. For those working remotely, it could be finding new and creative ways to collaborate or work on old or new projects. For all employees, there may be useful web-based training and professional development.

While UCF works on solutions to address issues that have been brought to HR’s attention, we encourage all supervisors and employees to think outside the box about how to continue working during this unique time.

Federal Work-Study
Today, UCF received clarity from the U.S. Department of Education on Federal Work-Study during the coronavirus pandemic. This guidance allows FWS students to be paid using scheduled work hours for the term without reporting to work, effective this pay period.

This is good news for our students who rely on this federal aid.

Because of the circumstances, students are not required to work during this period, but some may have worked or would like to continue working. Supervisors have the flexibility to allow this, and students will be paid regardless.

As always, the hours that students work should be documented on a timesheet and submitted to payroll for normal processing. UCF Human Resources will be communicating directly with departmental payroll processors and authorizers about how to pay students who are unable to work.

Moving Forward
Teams from across UCF are in regular communication and making decisions about the university’s next steps. We understand that the element of unknown in this situation is frustrating.

While answers don’t come easy, we assure you UCF is committed to making decisions with the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff members, and larger community in mind.

We’re also committed to sharing regular updates as soon as they are available at UCF’s coronavirus website",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/ucf-moving-instruction-online-for-rest-of-semester/,17-Mar-2020,"Today, several additional key precautions were put in place for campus communities across our state to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The Florida Board of Governors, which oversees state universities, has directed UCF, along with the state’s other public universities, to extend our period of remote learning through the end of the spring semester. This important and necessary action will protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff.

UCF’s team of academic leaders and emergency and health officials has been working diligently for several weeks to make sure our campus could quickly respond to the growing threat of COVID-19, including this large-scale move to remote learning.

Fortunately, UCF has been a long-time leader in digital learning with faculty, staff and students who are among the country’s most innovative thinkers and doers.

Still, these circumstances bring unique challenges, and I encourage our students to work directly with their faculty members to help balance new demands and ways of learning for the rest of the semester.

No decisions yet have been made about the summer terms.

Commencement Ceremonies Canceled
Based on additional direction from the Board of Governors today, we will be canceling our commencement ceremonies scheduled for April 30 through May 2.

This is sad and disappointing news, but we recognize that these ceremonies could not move forward given the social distancing requirements. We understand that commencement ceremonies are a major milestone in the lives of our graduates and the loved ones who have supported them on their educational journey.

That’s why we are evaluating options to include the possibility of celebrating our graduates at a future time, and we will share more information as soon as it’s available.

In the meantime, cap and gown costs will be reimbursed by the vendor, Herff Jones. More information about commencement and reimbursements is available on UCF’s coronavirus website.

Remote Working
Faculty and staff who are working remotely should expect to continue to do so for the immediate weeks ahead. We will continue to keep you informed about remote working guidelines as decisions are made about campus operations for the remainder of the spring semester.

I know all of us realize that these decisions, while extremely difficult, must occur to help protect the health of both our campus community and our community as a whole. We are working hard to do all we can to maximize opportunities for learning and working during what is an unprecedented time in our global history.

This continues to be a quickly changing and evolving situation, and I am so thankful for everyone across campus — from our students to our staff to each of our faculty members — who are working together to make our community a place that prioritizes safety and each other’s well-being.

I know we will continue to persevere and to take care of ourselves, our loved ones and our fellow Knights!

UCF has transitioned to remote instruction effective through the spring semester, under official direction from the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System. Additionally, UCF will continue with remote instruction through the Summer A, C and D semesters, which all start on Monday, May 11, to minimize health and safety risks to the UCF community. At this time, the university has not made a decision about remote instruction for the summer B term, which begins June 22.

All UCF campuses will remain open, but during this period of remote instruction, we are advising our students to stay at home and not return to campus at this time. Most employees, with the exception of employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, are asked to begin working remotely starting Wednesday. Students will be able to access almost all campus services remotely.

The most up-to-date information always will be available on UCF’s coronavirus website and pushed to the entire campus community through email and UCF Alert.

Impact at UCF
On March 19, UCF learned that one of our students has tested positive for COVID-19.

The incubation period for COVID-19 is 14 days, and we believe the risk of anyone who came into contact with him developing symptoms at this point is very low. Out of an abundance of caution, his residence hall and classrooms will be decontaminated for everyone’s safety.

The student is recovering away from UCF, and he has our best wishes for good health.

Additionally, a military contractor who works at the Partnership IV Building in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the main campus has tested positive for the coronavirus. Several of his colleagues also have submitted to tests.

While a small number of UCF Institute for Simulation and Training employees work in the same building, they aren’t believed to have come into contact with the military contractor. The UCF employees have already been working remotely and have been advised to monitor their health. Partnership IV will be closed for two weeks following thorough decontamination.

UCF also is aware of other students who have exhibited symptoms and are being tested and observing self-quarantine. While we believe their risk is low, this is a wake-up call that COVID-19 is at UCF and all of us must be vigilant.

UCF leadership, including Interim President Thad Seymour Jr., continues to make decisions in consultation with public health officials and state leaders that prioritize the health and safety of everyone at UCF and in our broader community.

Online Classes
Online classes will continue as usual starting March 16; face-to-face classes will be available in an online format on March 18. More information on clinical courses, recitals and other performances, and other activities that do not as easily lend themselves to virtual environments will be coming soon.

The academic affairs team has been providing more information and resources to faculty about how best to move their courses online and what resources need to be provided to students.

Remote instruction will continue through the summer A, C and D semesters. Because courses are being moved online, students should not to come back to campus during this period of remote instruction. Fourteen days is the period in which secondary transmission to others is thought to be highest, and UCF advises against any additional travel during this time.

Residence halls will remain open only as a last resort to on-campus student residents who have no other place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below, and must let Housing know of their plans by responding to the form in the Housing portal.

All UCF campuses will remain open for employees reporting to work. Student employees should contact their supervisors for guidance.

Closures and Cancellations
UCF will suspend all campus events starting Saturday, March 14, through at least the spring semester.

New events should not be scheduled. Cancellations include all UCF Athletics events, UCF Celebrates the Arts, Knight-Thon, meetings of student organizations, admissions tours and other academic and recreational meetings and events.

Academic advising offices will remain operational, but advisors will not meet with students in person until further notice. In order to receive advising support, students should call or email their advisor or advising office to schedule an appointment via phone or video conferencing software.

View a full list of what’s open at UCF.

UCF is taking these steps with the safety and wellbeing of our campus community top of mind. It is imperative that you also prioritize your personal safety by practicing good hand hygiene, limiting your contact with others and contacting your healthcare provider immediately in the event you present flu-like symptoms.

This is a dynamic, stressful situation that requires everyone’s continued flexibility and understanding. UCF is committed to regularly sharing information on UCF’s coronavirus website and communicating through email and UCF Alert.

Recreation and Wellness Center

The Recreation and Wellness Center (RWC) and Wellness and Health Promotion Services (WHPS) will close effective March 14.

The closures will last until university emergency management officials clear the UCF community to use RWC and WHPS programs and services again.

To learn more about accessing virtual services offered by the RWC at this time, visit rwc.sdes.ucf.edu/programs/keeping_active.

Employees
For the safety of all members of the UCF community in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the university will transition to temporary remote work effective Wednesday for at least two weeks.

On Monday, Human Resources shared more information about implementing remote work. This included a form that employees who will be working remotely will need to complete and send to HR.

In the meantime, those who are prepared to work remotely can begin doing with approval from their supervisor.

Following health officials’ guidance, high-risk employees also should work remotely starting as soon as possible. Those at high risk from COVID-19 include persons age 65 or older; those with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes; pregnancy; and/or immunodeficiency from medications or medical conditions.

With the exception of employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, all others should be ready to work remotely starting Wednesday.

The most up-to-date information is available at ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus.

Travel & Study Abroad
Earlier this week, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, and global travel is restricted. Everyone is expected to monitor their health, limit interactions with others, and upon showing symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider.

Based on guidance from state and federal officials, UCF is prohibiting all employees’ official university domestic and international travel for the next 30 days. The exception is employee travel between UCF campuses, which remains permitted.

Those with planned university travel will receive an email with guidance on canceling their trip. No Travel Approval Petitions will be approved at this time.

More information about work-related travel is available here: ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/faq.

As UCF has previously shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a country that has a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options. Personal domestic and international travel by all students and employees is strongly discouraged during this unique time in an effort to best protect you and those around you.

UCF already has canceled all faculty-led trips, international exchanges and participation in partner programs for students and staff members for the spring and summer semesters.

Protection and Prevention
COVID-19 can be spread among people and animals.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent the virus and no specific treatment.

COVID-19 appears to spread predominantly through coughing and sneezing from infected persons. Individuals in close proximity to such persons, or who contact objects that have been contaminated with the virus, are at risk of illness.

Coronavirus symptoms are generally flu-like and include fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing.

The virus enters our bodies through contact with our eyes, nose and mouth. If your hands become contaminated with the virus, and you touch those areas, you are at risk of becoming ill. Flu-like symptoms — including fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing — are thought to appear within two to 14 days after exposure. Anyone who has traveled in the past 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should visit their healthcare provider immediately.


While the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, everyone can take these simple steps to prevent the spread of germs.

Steps to prevent the spread of germs
These tips are helpful in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19:

Avoid shaking hands.
Wash hands often with soap and water. You should spend at least 10-20 seconds washing. More information about proper hand washing is available at cdc.gov/handwashing.
As much as possible, avoid touching your face — especially your eyes, nose and mouth — with unwashed hands.
Be cautious about what you touch, and wash your hands after touching any public surface. Avoid grasping shared surfaces such as door handles, gas pumps, grocery carts, elevator buttons, etc. with your hands. Use your knuckles or hips or a paper towel or disposable glove.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or sleeve and clean up immediately.
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.
Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer that is greater than 60% alcohol at home and in your car. Use the sanitizer after touching any public object.
Use disinfectant wipes at stores whenever they are available. Wipe both the handle and child seat of grocery carts.
Avoid contact with those who are sick, and avoid others if you are sick.
In addition, flu vaccines are highly recommended, as it is flu season. Flu shots are available for free to students at Student Health Services, and employees can also receive the shot there for a cost.

Hand sanitizer stations are available across campus, and UCF is adding more to high-traffic areas on campus to encourage use during flu season.

UCF Resources
The most up-to-date information is available at ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus.

The CDC is sharing comprehensive information about COVID-19 here: cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html. At UCF, anyone with additional questions may call UCF Student Health Services at 407-823-2509. The UCF Police Department, which is staffed 24/7, also is available by calling 407-823-5555.

Students experiencing distress related to the outbreak can reach Counseling and Psychological Services 24/7 by calling 407-823-2811.

UCF employees are encouraged to view the answers to these frequently asked questions.

UCF will continue to monitor COVID-19 and share updates. Remember, the most important precaution you can take is being mindful your personal health by avoiding contact with germs.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/learning-working-during-covid-19/,16-Mar-2020,"Today, UCF launched new practices for learning and working in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across our nation. For many, that means taking what we do online or finding other ways to best serve our students remotely.

It’s certainly unprecedented for our university, and there’s no doubt that this is a challenging and stressful time. But it’s also an illustration of how resilient we are as a campus and a community.

By Wednesday, we will have transitioned our courses to remote learning thanks to the ingenuity of our faculty members and incredible support from our Center for Distributed Learning. Individual departments also are working directly with their students to help them find ways to best fulfill their clinical, internship or other requirements so they’re disrupted as little as possible while following the best guidance from health officials.

New Remote Working Guidelines
Also by Wednesday, we are transitioning to temporary remote work for at least two weeks for our faculty and staff whose jobs can be performed while off campus. New guidelines for remote work are available here, along with forms and processes for employees and supervisors to follow.

Those who are prepared to work remotely can begin doing so immediately, with approval from their supervisor and after completing the HR form.

Following health officials’ guidance, high-risk employees also should work remotely starting as soon as possible. Those at high risk from COVID-19 include persons age 65 or older; those with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes; those who are pregnant; and those with immunodeficiency from medications or medical conditions.

We also know that not all employees’ jobs can be performed remotely. Some employees will be required to remain on campus because they support remote learning, campus operations or other essential areas.

Supervisors should work with each of their employees to determine what, where and how their duties will be performed.

Frequent communication between employees and their supervisors will be key during this time. To help, UCF HR has put together a thorough online FAQ that addresses a variety of issues for the university’s different types of employees. UCF IT also has developed a helpful guide for employees working remotely.
These and other updates on the university’s response will continue to be posted to UCF’s coronavirus website.

Keeping Each Other Safe
In keeping with guidance from our federal and local health officials, we have a responsibility to take actions that will keep not only our campus but our larger community safe. That means intentionally having a smaller number of people on our campus and practicing social distancing, or avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

With that in mind, we have canceled all campus events, including athletics events, through at least March 30. And, we are evaluating other large-scale events scheduled beyond the next two weeks, including commencement. We will be sharing updates with you soon.

UCF also has resources in place to help you navigate through this stressful time. UCF’s Employee Assistance Program, Health Advocate, is available at 877-240-6863 for free, confidential, 24/7 assistance for all employees, including OPS employees in this special circumstance.

Mental health support is available to all students via Counseling and Psychological Services, which can be reached 24/7 by calling 407-823-2811.

Finally, I would like to thank each of you for your patience and flexibility during this extraordinary time. While we are each doing our very best to take care of our students, let’s also remember to continue to prioritize personal safety and the wellbeing of those around us.

And, most of all, let’s keep Charging On!

https://provost.ucf.edu/news/provost/direction-for-ucf-faculty-on-research-laboratory-access-amid-coronavirus-concerns/,16-Mar-2020,"On Wednesday, March 18, we are moving the bulk of university operations to remote access, in an effort to keep employees safe. In the area of research, the goal is to minimize or limit the number of people in a site at any given time, while allowing research that is absolutely essential or time-sensitive to continue. I am asking each of you who does research or has a lab to ask yourself whether your research MUST be conducted in a face-to-face setting at the current time.

Faculty with a laboratory need to fill out the Laboratory Access Survey immediately. The survey was released Friday, but I understand that not everyone may have seen it. Please find it here.

In that survey, you are asked to identify people critical to maintaining time-sensitive and necessary lab operations. This is not a guarantee every person will have access, but the survey will help the Office of Research create an authorization list. Only individuals identified on the authorization list will be allowed to enter your lab beginning Wednesday. It is likely that each building on campus will be limited to one entry point beginning that day. These procedures are to implement social distancing and for the safety of our faculty, staff, and students. We reserve the right to limit or stop research that is not consistent with these procedures or poses a health threat to personnel.

I ask that you take a hard look at what lab work can be done remotely and move to that by Wednesday. When considering who should get physical access, ask yourself these questions:

Does the work have to be done right now?
What is the minimum number of people I need in the lab to get critical work done?
For safety reasons we envision no more than two people in any lab at any given time, unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as required safety requirements. A section of the survey allows for you to make that case. Remember to consider your graduate students and post-doctoral scholars as you make decisions.

I know times are difficult and it appears things change daily. Please keep checking the UCF Coronavirus website for all updated information. The Office of Research is also posting research-relevant information and sharing documents with the Provost Office to give you as many access points as possible. We also will be distributing additional information from EHS.

I know everyone believes the research he or she is doing is critical. However, in these unusual times, we need to do what is necessary to keep each other safe. Just remember that we are all human and concerned. All of our efforts are meant to help prevent the spread of this disease and keep you, students, staff and our broader community safe.",University of Central Florida
https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/a-message-from-your-student-body-president/,16-Mar-2020,"As you all may have seen, today, March 16, is the first day that UCF is moving to remote instruction in an effort to promote safety for all of the UCF community. I’m not going to sugar coat this, I know this isn’t an easy adjustment for a lot of us.

This decision wasn’t made without a lot of considerations — it came after long consultations with medical and community experts that have advised us that this is the best way to move forward to keep everyone safe, which is our top priority in these trying times.

That being said, it is crucial that all students remember that spring break is over, and that we do not confuse an online school experience with an extension of spring break festivities. I urge all students to continue to check their Webcourses frequently and stay up to date with how their courses will be adapted to fit this new structure.

In an email to the student body, Vice President of Student Development and Enrollment Services, Dr. Maribeth Ehasz announced that any approved travel for registered student organizations, including travel previously approved by our Student Government allocations, are canceled. Along with this, all events through at least March 30 are canceled. My sincerest apologies to all RSO’s that are affected by this. I know these trips mean a lot to your organizations, and I share your frustrations that these opportunities are being taken away.

I know for many students this can be extremely difficult and I want to take a moment to empathize with each and every one of your current situations. To any student employee, on or off-campus, who relies on a thriving UCF community for work – we will come back stronger. In the meantime, I urge you to seek out any resources you need to help you, like our Knights Pantry.

To all of our incoming Freshmen and lowerclassmen, I know this isn’t your ideal Spring Semester. You may have been looking forward to many events that are now canceled and are missing out on seeing what a beacon of light UCF really is. Please keep in mind that the future of UCF is still bright, and you will have so much more to look forward to.

To all of our upperclassmen, and especially our graduating seniors, I am sorry and I am right there with you. This semester a lot of “lasts” have been taken from us, and I know how heavy a toll this may be taking on the final months of your college experience. I am in awe of your selflessness in handling this pandemic, and I encourage you all to use this time to reflect on everything you have been able to do during your time at UCF – rather than what we may be missing out on.

We are doing a good thing here. We are helping slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and everyone’s safety is our main concern. We need to band together, support each other, and remember that we will overcome this adversity.

That being said, the CDC has recommended canceling all events with a gathering of over 50 people for the next 8 weeks, and I encourage you all to take these recommendations to heart. UCF has taken courageous steps in an attempt to slow the spread of this pandemic, but it is only effective to the level of which you take this matter seriously.

This is not a time to panic, but to listen to the experts and follow their suggestions about social distancing and practicing good hygiene. In terms of UCF and its efforts, please refer back to Dr. Ehasz’s email, and follow the links she provided to be aware of all the resources UCF can provide to you.

There are still a lot of questions that I don’t know the answer to, but Student Government will continue to do our best to keep everyone’s spirits at ease.

I have great confidence in the UCF community and I know that we will get through this together.

As always, especially during these trying times, Go Knights! Charge On!

We know that social distancing is one of the key ways we can help protect the health of our community, and to this end, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel our upcoming events, including UCF Celebrates the Arts.   

Public offerings from the College of Arts and Humanities, including concerts, recitals, lectures, exhibitions, theatre performances, etc., are cancelled or postponed at least through the end of the Spring 2020 semester. UCF Celebrates the Arts 2020, planned for April 7-19 at Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, is also cancelled.

While this news is disappointing, our primary concern is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, employees and community. We did not make this decision lightly, as we recognize the preparation already invested into these events and the educational value of the students’ presentations. However, this altered schedule allows everyone to focus on individual health and the welfare of the community at-large.

Patrons who have already reserved tickets have several options:

Request a refund or future credit for their tickets by contacting the box office prior to the event date. Call 407-823-1500 or email boxoffice@ucf.edu.We anticipate a high volume of calls, please leave a message and a representative will return the call as soon as possible.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/keeping-our-campus-community-safe/,12-Mar-2020,"Yesterday, UCF along with other state universities announced we are moving to online instruction for at least two weeks starting Monday. While all UCF campuses will remain open with employees reporting to work, we are advising our students to stay at home and not return to campus during that time.

These are unprecedented steps that significantly impact how we learn, teach and operate. But as the number of Florida cases of COVID-19 continues to increase, the safety and wellbeing of our campus community must be our No. 1 priority, especially as students and faculty prepare to return from spring break.

This is a stressful situation that requires everyone’s flexibility and understanding. We know there are still many unanswered questions about how these decisions will affect each of our students and faculty and staff members.

Teams of university officials — everyone from emergency management and health officials to academic and student support leaders — are working together to quickly finalize more details so that we can share them with you by the end of this week.

The most up-to-date information always will be available on UCF’s coronavirus website and pushed to the entire campus community through email and UCF Alert.

Online Instruction and Research
Our academic affairs team, for example, has been providing more information and resources to faculty about how best to move their courses online and what resources need to be provided to students.

While all current online courses will continue as usual, courses in other modalities, including face-to-face, will be canceled Monday and Tuesday. All faculty are expected to have their courses available to students online by Wednesday, March 18. More information on clinical courses, recitals and other performances, and other activities that do not as easily lend themselves to virtual environments will be coming soon.

The Office of Research also will continue to provide guidance directly to faculty researchers regarding their ongoing work and labs over the next two weeks.

Housing
While we have advised students not to return to campus for two weeks beginning Monday, residence halls will remain open only for on-campus student residents who do not have an alternative place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below.

Housing will be reaching out to students who live on campus with further information and instructions for those who will be returning.

Travel
As UCF has previously shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a country that has a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options.

If any member of our campus community has returned from one of these countries in the past two weeks — or will soon be returning from one of these countries — please immediately contact Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

Those who have traveled to CDC Level 2 countries or taken a cruise should monitor their health, limit interactions with others for 14 days after returning to the U.S., and immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider upon showing symptoms.

UCF already has canceled all faculty-led trips, international exchanges and participation in partner programs for students and staff members for the spring and summer semesters.

As guidance from the state changes, the university will share new information about travel restrictions via email and the UCF coronavirus website.

Campus Events and Activities
Following CDC and Florida Department of Health guidance, faculty and staff members are expected to continue working.

But beginning next week, some campus services will not be available while courses are moved online.

Student employees should contact their supervisors regarding work assignments and accommodations. Other information about what will be open and closed beginning next week is coming soon.

It has become increasingly clear that social distancing is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing means avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining distance from others when possible.

Earlier this week, UCF provided guidance related to university events, and today, UCF Athletics announced that Knights’ home games would be played without spectators. Soon, we will be communicating additional information related to university events.

There’s no doubt that this is a critical time for our university, state, country and the world. We are working hard so UCF is prepared to ensure our students, faculty and staff can continue to safely receive a quality education, teach and work.

I have incredible confidence in our team — and in each of you. We will be compassionate and creative and apply the grit that we use to tackle any challenge that we face — like Knights always do.

Colleagues:

The Board of Governors, to minimize health risks from COVID-19, has directed state universities to move courses to remote delivery and advise students not to return to campus following spring break. Today, UCF advised students to remain away from campus for two weeks starting Monday, March 16. Under current plans, which are fluid, students are to return on Monday, March 30. Faculty and other employees are to report to work as usual (unless the travel restrictions apply).

All current online courses will continue as usual. Courses in other modalities, including face-to-face, will be canceled Monday and Tuesday. Faculty teaching other modalities must take steps to make them available to students online by Wednesday, March 18. Online teaching will be required for at least two weeks.

This has been a rapidly evolving situation, and today’s information is different from what you received only yesterday. Because of that, we ask and expect that you will frequently check your email and the UCF Coronavirus website for updates.

Meanwhile, beginning immediately, the following is required:

● Take steps to move your face-to-face and other courses to fully online delivery by Wednesday, March 18, using the resources below. Explore the resources, experiment with options, and seek help as needed from the Webcourses@ucf support team (https://cdl.ucf.edu/support/webcourses).

● Review the new “Keep Teaching” website, which offers options to help you move courses online as easily as possible. Resources include self-paced training on online course essentials.

● Watch the “Getting Started” workshop video. A recorded session will be available on the “Keep Teaching” website before the end of this week. If it is not posted when you access “Keep Teaching,” please continue checking as the site is periodically updated.

● Consider joining additional workshops next week that will allow faculty to ask questions. While these sessions will be offered live at the Faculty Multimedia Center (Main Campus, CB1-202), faculty are encouraged to follow social distancing guidelines and attend remotely:
— Tuesday, March 17, 3-4 p.m.
— Wednesday, March 18, 2-3 p.m.
— Thursday, March 19, 10-11 a.m.
— Friday, March 20, 2-3 p.m.

No registration is required. Each workshop will be live-streamed on the “Keep Teaching” website and recorded for review. Additional workshops will be scheduled as needed.

● Consider “open lab” assistance. The Webcourses@ucf support team will be on-site in the Faculty Multimedia Center (CB1-202) for individual walk-in support this week and next. For remote support sessions, please set an appointment.

We will continue to keep you informed of new developments. Remember, for the latest updates (not only about teaching), see UCF’s Coronavirus website.

I appreciate your flexibility during this difficult time and ask that you please be creative over the next two weeks in providing a high-quality experience. Finally, please have compassion for students for whom this will be a challenge.

Classes that are currently online will continue Monday. All other classes will be ready for online instruction by Wednesday. Information is currently available at ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus, and more updates will be shared via email with students and faculty over the next few days.

Remote instruction will continue for at least two weeks. Because courses are being moved online, students should not come back to campus for the next two weeks. Fourteen days is the period in which secondary transmission to others is thought to be highest, and UCF advises against any additional travel during this time.

Students should stay at or return to their permanent residences. Residence halls will remain open for residents who do not have an alternative place to stay, and certain campus services may not be available.

All UCF campuses will remain open for employees, who are expected to continue working. Student employees should contact their supervisors for guidance.

https://www.ucf.edu/coronavirus/updated-coronavirus-guidance/,11-Mar-2020,"While no cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported at UCF, the university continues monitoring the virus’ spread and evaluating the many impacts it may have on our campus community.

UCF is developing plans for modified operations should Coronavirus more directly impact the university. Campus is not expected to close. Essential campus operations would continue, with remote work and online class options should conditions require.

University officials continue to meet regularly on prevention efforts and planning for UCF using updated guidance from our state and federal health partners. Keeping our campus community safe and informed is our top priority.

Information and other resources will continue to be shared on UCF’s Coronavirus website, which will be updated as COVID-19 evolves or more directly impacts the university.

University Travel
In keeping with federal guidance, UCF has added Azerbaijan, China, Hong Kong, Italy, Iran, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Turkmenistan to its restricted destinations. All study abroad and university travel to these countries has been canceled, and we anticipate more countries will be added to this list as the virus spreads.

Because of that and out an abundance of caution, UCF is canceling all study abroad trips planned through the summer semester.

The Florida Department of Health advises that anyone returning from a country that has a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Level 3 Travel Health Notice self-quarantines for 14 days upon return. If you have returned from one of these countries in the past two weeks — or will soon be returning from one of these countries, please immediately contact Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

Event Guidance
While the campus’ operations remain normal, we are closely monitoring state guidance as it relates to event cancelations. We encourage you to consider alternatives to face-to-face meetings, such as livestreaming, for in-person events.

Other factors to consider based on the CDC’s guidance are:

Necessity of event;
attendance size and whether a significant number of participants are expected to travel to or from the region for this event;
the age and health of expected attendees, particularly older individuals; and
financial impact of cancelation and contract obligations.
Questions about the necessity of events should be directed to your dean or vice president.

As public health guidance evolves, the university may postpone or cancel upcoming events in prioritizing health and wellbeing. University officials also are reviewing existing upcoming events that have registered using the SAFE form and may be reaching out to event organizers with additional questions or guidance.

Courses and Academic Activities
While there are no immediate plans to move all courses online because of COVID-19, the university has been making plans if it is necessary to do so.

Faculty are receiving instructions and resources for shifting their coursework online. If this were to occur, the university community would immediately be notified of the change. Students would be expected to work directly with their faculty members to continue their studies.

Finally, we appreciate our campus community’s commitment to supporting each other during this time.

We understand that this situation can be stressful and these decisions have far-reaching impacts. We also know that we must do what is in the best interest of keeping all Knights safe, and we’ll continue to share precautionary measures and updates with you.

FAQs about Graduate Studies and Caronavirus
From Dr. Elizabeth Klonoff, vice president for Research and dean of the College of Undergraduate Studies

Due to the unprecedented COVID-19 emergency, investigators may be required to alter their protocols in ways to minimize the spread of this virus. The following outlines when or if the Institutional Review Board needs to be notified.

Should I continue my protocol under the COVID-19 emergency? (Updated April 10, 2020)

All research involving face-to-face interaction must halt if it cannot be done via a different mechanism such as phone, Skype, Zoom, etc. If the researcher has reason to believe halting the research will add risk to the subject, the researcher should contact the IRB.

What types of changes can I make to my protocol that do not require IRB approval?

In general, changes that:

a) Are temporary in nature in order to limit subject exposure to the virus. This means that when this crisis is over, you will return to all pre-crisis procedures.
i) Change on interaction methods, such as changes from face-to-face to over the phone or some other similar devices.
ii) Please remember that this change can only be implemented if it presents no greater risk to participants. For example, if your study was taking place in person to avoid the risk by direct observations of the research subjects, a change to over the phone would not be permitted without a formal review by the IRB in the form of a modification.
b) Do not add any additional risk to any subjects or study staff.
c) You should make a note in your study records regarding the above mentioned minor temporary change(s) that were made along with the justification in case you are ever audited.

What type of changes “must” be approved by the IRB prior to implementing them?

In general, changes that:

a) Are not being made as a direct result of the COVID-19 crisis, no matter how minor.
b) Are greater-than-minimal risk changes that are a result of the COVID 19 crisis.
c) Are on the protocol that is a greater-than-minimal risk study.

What if the greater-than-minimal risk revision can’t wait for IRB approval?

If it is in the best interest of the subject, and will minimize or prevent transmission of COVID 19, then make the change, however:
a) You should immediately notify the IRB by email.
b) You should make a note the change(s) in your study records with the justification.
c) You must submit the revision of protocol with the change(s) to the IRB as soon as possible, noting that the revision was implemented because of an emergency, including the justification for that emergent change(s).

What if there is a desire or need to keep a temporary COVID-19-related change a permanent change?

a) If the change is consistent with item #2 above, then initiate the change and submit the revision.
b) When you submit the revision, please include in the description of the revision that the change was already implemented, and the reason it was implemented “emergently”.

What if you decide to suspend your study until the COVID-19 crisis is over?

a) There is no need to inform the IRB. However,
i) If your study is a greater-than-minimal risk study that involves some type of patient care, you must ensure your suspension does not increase any risk to those study subjects.
ii) If possible, make sure you contact any study subject who will be affected by this suspension (ie a study visit will be canceled, etc.)
b) You should make a note in your study records of this temporary suspension along with the justification and any actions taken in case you are ever audited.

If you have any additional questions, contact IRB. Please be patient as we anticipate a large volume of requests at this time.",University of Central Florida

For the latest information and instructions visit UCF’s website dedicated to this issue. Our first priority is your safety and that of our campus community. We know you likely have concerns about the impact the outbreak may have on your research work.

Now is a good time to evaluate how your work in the lab or in the field may be impacted should conditions necessitate. Think weeks, not days. What research is essential and must be completed in the lab? Can your work be done remotely? How many people truly need access to the lab and how often? Are there special safety concerns? These are some of the questions you should be asking to prepare your mitigation plan.

Should face-to-face classes and events be canceled, access to campus and your labs may become limited, and you want to position yourself in the best way to weather disruptions with the least possible impact. The Office of Research is working hand-in-hand with university leadership to plan logistics as necessitated by the outbreak. We are also in communication with sponsor agencies to understand and communicate their responses.

Here is what you can count on from UCF. We will maintain power and telecommunications functions. UCF is closely working with the Florida Department of Health, the CDC, and other local and national agencies. We will communicate through the dedicated website https://www.ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/ and email.

In keeping with federal guidance, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mongolia, Italy, Iran and Japan are on UCF’s restricted destinations list, with study abroad programs to these countries canceled. UCF strongly recommends that all students and faculty and staff members also avoid personal travel to these countries.

Anyone returning from these countries is required to self-quarantine for 14 days, the period in which they could be contagious and pose a threat to others, and not return to campus until after that time. Any students or faculty or staff members who travel to these countries despite the warnings and with the understanding they will be required to self-quarantine should inform UCF of their plans by calling Student Health Services at 407-823-2509.

COVID-19 remains dynamic, and travel advisories are subject to change. Travelers should closely monitor travel information from the CDC: cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html.

Destinations with large, confined groups of people pose a higher risk of transmission. Travelers should proceed with caution, thoroughly research their destination, and consult with their doctors and UCF regarding any concerns.

I encourage you to not let the worries about the Coronavirus impact a fun and restful Spring Break. Rather, prioritize your safety and well-being, and make smart decisions.

Remain mindful that our hands are the vehicle for the spread of germs. Wash your hands often, and avoid using unclean hands to touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Know that UCF remains in regular contact with local, state and federal health agencies, and we’ll continue to share precautionary measures and other updates with you.

https://provost.ucf.edu/news/provost/to-ucf-faculty-on-coronavirus-be-safe-and-think-ahead/#new_tab,5-Mar-2020,"Dear Faculty Colleagues:

All of us are following the rapidly evolving news about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Although we hope that UCF will continue running as normal, the university is committed to being prepared. We must consider the possibility of students, staff, and faculty falling ill or being placed in isolation, and even the possibility of canceling face-to-face classes. Before spring break begins, I want to inform you about planning that is underway to allow us to continue to serve our students well.

UCF’s top priority is the personal safety of our faculty, students and staff. On Tuesday, UCF launched a website that provides prevention and health tips, helpful resources, FAQs, and regular updates about the Coronavirus and its effects. Urgent information is frequently distributed through UCF Alerts, so please be sure your information is current in myUCF. A Coronavirus information module has also been added to the UCF Mobile App.

We have not yet been significantly affected by COVID-19, and we do not know whether this will rise to a level that requires UCF to implement any significant response. However, this is the time to make contingency plans. University-wide plans are being developed (e.g., travel, working from home, etc.). Here is some of the planning underway for academic matters: 

One step is important in the short run: Please consider relaxing attendance policies so that ill students do not feel compelled to come to class. It will be important to take this step before we know it is needed and to protect our entire community.
If conditions require, we will move all possible courses online. UCF’s Center for Distributed Learning is developing a comprehensive website with tools and resources that will allow you to quickly shift online if this becomes necessary. This information will be shared with you after spring break. In the meantime, please think creatively about how to teach your courses if classes cannot meet in person.
We are also examining solutions for research laboratories if these conditions occur.
More detailed plans will follow. Thank you for taking the steps needed to provide students with the exceptional education they deserve.",University of Central Florida

The Florida Department of Health is monitoring these individuals, who remain in isolation. It is likely that additional cases in the state will be announced in coming days.

UCF is continuing communication, coordination and planning using updated guidance from our state and federal health partners. Today, we launched a new website, ucf.edu/coronavirus/coronavirus, which will be regularly updated with the latest information. The most important thing you can do right now is take precautions and prioritize your personal safety.

Protection and Prevention

COVID-19 symptoms are generally flu-like and include fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing. Symptoms are thought to appear within two to 14 days after exposure, and a person can be contagious but not symptomatic.

While the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, everyone can take these simple steps to prevent the spread of germs:

Wash hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. More information about proper hand washing is available here: cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue or your elbow and dispose of tissue immediately.
Avoid contact with those who are sick, and avoid others if you are sick.
If you’re feeling sick, stay home. Do not risk your health or the well-being of others by trying to “tough it out.”
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.
Avoid grasping shared surfaces such as door handles, gas pumps, grocery carts, elevator buttons, etc. with your hands. Use your knuckles or hips or a paper towel or disposable glove.
Avoid shaking hands.
Flu vaccines are highly recommended, as it is flu season. Flu shots are available for free to students at Student Health Services, and employees can also receive the shot there for a cost.

Hand sanitizer stations are available across campus, and UCF is adding more to high-traffic areas on campus to encourage use during flu season.

Travel

In keeping with federal guidance regarding avoiding nonessential travel, UCF Global has added China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mongolia, Italy and Japan to its restricted destinations list. All study abroad programs to these countries have been canceled.

Any students who return from travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea are required to self-quarantine and not return to campus for 14 days after their return, the period in which they could be contagious and pose a threat to others.

UCF Global is closely monitoring developments in the area and will continue to provide updates here: global.ucf.edu/international-health-and-safety/restricted-travel/

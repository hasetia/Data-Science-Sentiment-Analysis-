22-Jan-20,312,Irvine,"It’s that time of year when many of us get run down and catch colds or even the flu. You may also be seeing news stories on the increasing influenza rates, as well as a new virus in from Wuhan China called Coronavirus. While there may be people at UCI tending to the common cold or the flu, there are currently no known exposures on campus of the Coronavirus.

However, we want to take this opportunity to remind our Anteater family of the precautions to take to prevent contracting any virus-borne illness. Most importantly, wash your hands often, stay well hydrated and if you are feeling any symptoms such as a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, please contact your healthcare provider.

Additionally, as a student, keeping up-to-date with our immunization policy is essential. Please make sure that you are following requirements and have uploaded your immunization documentation to the UCI Student Health Portal. Faculty and staff should review their health records or visit a medical provider with questions about their vaccinations.

Any student suspecting they have influenza or the Coronavirus should call the Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304, or call their primary medical provider prior to arriving at the medical office. This allows us to provide you with information on your illness, and plan for your visit to the clinic if needed. Faculty and staff should contact their provider’s office for additional instructions about seeking care.

If you seek more information about the Coronavirus, please visit the website for the Center for Disease Control at www.cdc.gov. We are committed to working with the Orange County Health Agency, UCI Health, and other community partners to keep our campus healthy and inform you of any new developments.

We appreciate your help in ensuring the health of the UCI community.

Coronavirus FAQ – Jan. 26, 2020

What is the Coronavirus?

The 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a large family of viruses that are a common cause of mild upper respiratory infections, but also include both SARS and MERS, which can cause more serious disease. Most patients with coronavirus have mild symptoms, however this new virus has resulted in cases of severe illnesses and deaths reported in China.

To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

What is being done to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus?

To reduce further spread of the infection, Wuhan City and nearby areas have implemented travel restrictions. Airports in the US (including LAX), are now screening entering travelers from certain areas for symptoms of respiratory infection.

Locally, this is an evolving situation. The campus and medical center are in coordination with Orange County Health Care Agency resources and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) to provide ongoing clinical guidance.

Have there been any POSITIVE (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus cases on the UCI Campus?

No, we are informed there are currently no positive Coronavirus cases on the UCI campus or at the UCI Medical Center. Detailed information of confirmed cases in the U.S. can be found on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website as such information becomes available.

Is there a vaccine for Coronavirus, and can I be tested for Coronavirus if I feel unwell?

There is currently no vaccine for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working around the clock to develop one.

The only current testing for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is done at the CDC Laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia. At this point, testing is only performed for patients who meet all of the clinical and travel criteria.

What should I do if I think I have the Coronavirus? 

If you have a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath:

Stay Home from school/work if you are having symptoms 
Wash your hands and stay well hydrated/drinking fluids 
Cover your cough, and avoid close contact with others 
Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment 
If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, or have been in close contact with someone who has recently traveled to Wuhan, China, within 14 days before the onset of your symptoms, please notify your provider/clinic BEFORE entering their office. It is important to call so that your provider/clinic can be prepared for your visit.

The UCI Student Health Center has developed triage screening (by phone and at our front desks) and has implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff.

UCI Students should call Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304.

UCI Faculty and Staff should call their healthcare provider immediately for care.

What can I do to help keep from getting the Coronavirus, or other infections?

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school
Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food
If you have not received your annual flu shot, please visit the UCI SHC website to review the schedule, and schedule a Flu Shot visit
Do face masks protect against coronavirus? Do I need one?

For now, public health officials say there’s no need to wear face masks in the United States; however, there is likely no harm in adding this additional layer of prevention, especially for people who think they may be sick.

Health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases will follow CDC recommendations to wear the N95 respirator mask, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors.

How will I know if things change/there are any cases at UCI?

The UCI Student Health Center will continue to screen and identify possible cases of Coronavirus. We are committed to providing optimal care for those with symptoms, and to helping ensure appropriate treatment and exposure prevention. As the situation changes and we have new information, we will send timely updates to the campus community."

We want to provide you this midweek update to address the latest information on Coronavirus and UCI operations, as well as to quell some of the rumors that are traveling through campus. As was noted in the campus zotmail dated January 26, there was a positive case of the Novel Wuhan Coronavirus identified in Orange County. That individual is recovering in isolation, and has no affiliation with UCI.

UCI continues to operate normally, classes are not cancelled and the campus is not closed. Additionally, all ancillary activities such as seminars, athletic competitions, performances, and events continue to proceed as scheduled. Students should plan to continue attending classes and participating in campus activities. 

You will soon see reminders around campus as we prepare to launch a poster campaign to maintain vigilance within the Anteater community during this time of progressing information. As a preventative measure, campus facilities and custodial are increasing the frequency for wiping down common areas and using disinfectant, as well.

Since the last email update to campus, a website was created to house all updates related to Coronavirus and UCI operations. We invite you to visit: https://ehs.uci.edu/PublicHealth/coronavirus.html. On this website are two sets of FAQs: one for students and one for faculty and staff. You can find the buttons for the FAQs on the right side of the screen. Please check back to this page often as we are continuing to post updates as information about Coronavirus evolves.

Additionally, please listen to this UCI podcast where I talk candidly about the common questions students are asking both on campus and in social media. Here you can learn the latest information on face masks, and the symptoms and criteria for Coronavirus, as well as addressing the anxieties and fears students are expressing.

We continue to work with the Orange County Health Care Agency and medical center leadership to evaluate the situation in Orange County, and we will share updates by email, social media, and on both the Student Health Center and Public Health websites. And, we continue to follow the guidance of the Center for Disease Control.

31-Jan-20,392,Irvine,"Dear Anteaters, 

As the week comes to an end, I want to provide an update on the novel Coronavirus:

There are currently NO UCI students, staff, or faculty identified by the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) as “Persons Under Investigation” for the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus.
There are NO NEW positive cases identified in Orange County.
UCI leadership have been meeting daily to discuss developments and keep our campus informed and safe. We are also working closely with the OCHCA and the UC system. We continue to follow Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance and have not been directed to quarantine or isolate students, staff, or faculty who have had recent travel to China.

The CDC continues to enforce the proactive screening of new travelers from high-risk areas as they enter the United States at major airports. These travelers are screened for symptoms, and depending on findings, may be advised on infection precautions, or tested and possibly isolated prior to returning to their home/work/school.

Masks 
UCI is following the counsel of both the CDC and the University of California, which advises that available masks are for ill patients only, who we advise should stay home and recover before returning to classes.

Use of the specialized N95 masks is primarily designated for staff who have the highest potential contact with potentially sick individuals, such as healthcare providers and first responders.

Feelings of Concern 
We are all aware of the anxiety that comes from the unknown, and there are still many unknowns about the Coronavirus. We have resources for our students who are feeling stressed and we encourage them to contact the UCI Counseling Center for support. Staff and faculty who are feeling anxious should contact the Employee Assistance Program.

The campus has launched a campaign this week with wellness ambassadors to bring awareness to best practices for staying healthy – physically and mentally. Ambassadors are also able to answer your questions regarding what is currently known about the Coronavirus, influenza, and the common cold. 

As always, remember to wash your hands with soap and water frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep. Thank you for your cooperation in protecting the UCI community.

3-Feb-20,456,Irvine,"Dear Campus Community,
On Jan. 30, 2020, University of California President Janet Napolitano directed the UC community to temporarily “avoid all non-essential travel” to China. As a result of this directive, the campus and medical center have developed a process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential, or if it can be postponed.

UCI faculty, staff, and students should also be aware that on Jan. 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 alert, its most severe warning, stating “do not travel to China due to the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus.” In addition, commercial airline carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China making travel difficult.

UC restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal, but such travelers should be aware of travel risks, and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.

Approval Process Prior to Travel

As result of President Napolitano’s directive, all non-essential travel to China is now restricted until further notice. All travelers who would like to engage in essential travel to China (defined in the following categories) must obtain prior approval as follows:

The UCI campus has an existing travel approval policy and process that applies to students. This policy and process are being temporarily extended to include faculty and staff travel to China.

The Policy for Student International Activities – http://www.policies.uci.edu/policies/pols/420-10.php – includes a review process by the UCI International Risk Review Team which will temporarily include representation from UCI Health and the Academic Senate, as this policy is being extended to include faculty.

During this time, anyone who believes their travel to China is essential should contact the UCI International Risk Review Team to request review and approval before travel. Please email global@uci.edu to request a review.

As directed by President Napolitano, it is of the utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for university-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry https:/ehs.ucop.edu/away before their expected departure. This information must be kept up-to-date as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keep the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as coronavirus.

For more information on coronavirus, please visit the following sites:

• Centers for Disease Control (CDC)

• Campus EH&S Public Health Information

4-Feb-20,234,Irvine,"Dear Instructors, 

We ask that you refrain from requiring written excuses from medical personnel for absence due to illness. Many healthy people experience a mild-to-moderate illness and recover without the need to seek medical attention.

The UCI Student Health Center does not have the capacity to evaluate such illnesses and provide documentation excusing student absences. However, our providers will continue to provide documentation when a student is being treated by the Student Health Center for an illness that necessitates a change in course load or an incomplete.

From time-to-time the Academic Senate has issued guidance concerning missed classes and exams due to illnesses such as influenza advising that students not attend class if they have a fever. Should a student experience repeated absences due to illness, it may be appropriate for the faculty member to ask the student to seek medical advice or consult with Disability Services Center for temporary accommodations. 

The Senate guidelines advise faculty to use flexibility and good judgment in determining whether to excuse missed work, extend deadlines, or substitute an alternative assignment. Only the Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI) can waive the final exam. However, a department chair can authorize an instructor to offer an alternative format for a final exam (e.g., paper, take-home exam) on a one-time basis.

Thank you for your valuable time and attention.

CDC: What to do if you are sick with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"
14-Feb-20,1276,Irvine,"The Coronavirus pandemic is a global event affecting more than 25 countries. As you have read in recent campus messages from Dr. Albert Chang, medical director of the Student Health Center, there is still much that is unknown clinically about the novel virus. Knowledge is critical in informing how we respond, and it is for this reason that researchers – at UCI and around the world – are actively engaged in understanding and containing this novel virus.

Campus leaders, faculty experts, and student ambassadors are striving to share evidence-based best practices from the Centers for Disease Control, continually updating our coronavirus information resources; broadening our public health education campaign; and partnering with local and county public health agencies. We are living in this moment together.

Underlying the unknowns of the virus itself are assumptions and fears rooted in the human condition of coping with misinformation and the desire to protect one’s health. I explore these factors in the most recent episode of the UCI Podcast on inclusivity during challenging times.

What’s in a name?

As this pandemic has evolved over the past several weeks, so has the name and way in which we communicate about the novel Coronavirus. In its early days, the name of the city of Wuhan was used to describe the virus. The practice of associating a pathogen with a point of origin is shorthand for capturing a shifting and fast-moving process of discovery and transmission. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally adopted the acronym COVID-19. UCI has adopted this term. We will also use the term “Coronavirus” or “novel Coronavirus” in our communications.

What has come from this name change is an important lesson about the use of language in our multi-cultural world. Shorthand references to points of origin have unintentional cognitive impacts, such as triggering implicit biases and stereotypes. This practice can stigmatize an entire region. Among examples in the distant and recent past, include the “Spanish Flu” in the 20th century and Ebola (a tributary of the Congo River in Central Republic of Africa) in recent memory. These terms are not only inaccurate but also reinforce groundless fears and stereotypes about regions in the world, not to mention the people who inhabit them; and others who immigrated or travelled to from the affected areas.

Correcting Course

The WHO’s decision to adopt the acronym COVID-19 is an important step in focusing attention on the virus, and interrupting implicit assumptions and explicit stereotypes about the affected communities and individuals who travel to and from China. However, in the intervening time since news of the novel Coronavirus broke in January and WHO’s official naming of the virus this week, Chinese and Chinese American communities have felt the impact of both unintentional and intentional biases and discrimination.

It is all of our individual responsibility to help shift this sentiment against a group of people and engage in dialogue based on accurate information about the Coronavirus and reject stereotypes and prejudice, whether on-line or in public. It is not enough to expect equity for ourselves but fail to advocate on behalf of others; to support diversity without understanding the diverse communities that make up our community; to practice inclusion without confronting bias and prejudice; and honor free speech without using it for advancing inclusive excellence.

At UCI, each person matters. It’s a commitment that extends beyond our campus borders to communities near and far. As Dr. Martin Luther King famously wrote “we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied by a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” By appreciating our diversity and practicing intentional inclusivity, we expand our individual capacity for intelligent empathy. Let us consider this insight in responding to global events in the local context.

Douglas M. Haynes.
Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion"
25-Feb-20,1234,Irvine,"Dear Anteaters:

We write to provide you an update on the COVID-19 outbreak and impacts as it pertains to our campus community. As you may have seen in the latest news coverage, COVID-19 has now spread to regions across the globe including Japan, South Korea, and Italy. Researchers at UCI and elsewhere continue to work around the clock to better understand and mitigate the impacts and transmission of this novel coronavirus.

While there are no current known cases in Orange County, it is important to keep in mind best practices for staying well and considering your risk of exposure to the virus through travel activity. This is critically important to keep in mind as spring break is around the corner and many students, faculty and staff are making plans to travel home or make other trips.

No matter where you travel, always know the status of your visa, and always have some emergency contacts. And, while there, you should also consult the website of the country you are visiting to see what policies are in place. Medical experts advise that the risk is low if you are traveling to a country where there are few or no cases of COVID-19. However, it is emphasized that you should evaluate your trip each day and look for any updates from the local authorities and from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Whether for university business or personal travel, let UCI know if you plan to travel anytime. The best way to do this is by registering your travel information at UC International Travel Registry even if you are a U.S. Citizen. Sharing your travel information allows us to have knowledge of your whereabouts should you be in an area of the world that sees an increase in COVID-19 cases such that your return home becomes compromised.

The details and guidance offered below reflect the current state of affairs and recommendations from the CDC and the U.S. Department of State. Please take care to read through them if you have any travel planned. Further below, we offer links to official resources and contact information should you need to connect with someone about your individual situation.

Closer to home, we ask that everyone continue to do their part in preserving a health community at UCI and prevent spreading illnesses, including the influenza which continues to be a bigger threat locally. Remember these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hand with soap and water
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough
Stay in your room if you are sick
Clean and disinfect surfaces often
The golden rule for travel is this: if you are the one who is sick, stay home, do not travel, and wear a mask, even for the flu.

Finally, as Doug Haynes, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion recently noted in a campus email and podcast on inclusion during difficult times, please be mindful of cultural and racial aspects of the present time, particularly with regard to the growing awareness of the threat of the novel coronavirus. UCI welcomes international scholars and values our partnerships around the world.

International Travel Guidance

Restrictions

As of Feb. 25, CDC has issued the following travel guidance related to COVID-19:
China – Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel – last updated Feb. 22;
South Korea – Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel – last updated Feb. 24;
Japan – Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions – last updated Feb. 22;
Hong Kong – Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions – issued Feb. 19
CDC also recommends that all travelers reconsider cruise ship voyages into or within Asia at this time.
Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions traveling in these regions may be at increased risk for severe disease.
Let UCI know you plan to travel

All travelers who would like to engage in essential travel to China and South Korea (defined in the following categories) must obtain prior approval as follows:
The UCI campus has an existing travel approval policy and process that applies to students. This policy and process are being temporarily extended to include faculty and staff travel to China and South Korea.
The Policy for Student International Activities includes a review process by the UCI International Risk Review Team which will temporarily include representation from UCI Health and the Academic Senate, as this policy is being extended to include faculty.
During this time, anyone who believes their travel to China or South Korea is essential should contact the UCI International Risk Review Team to request review and approval before travel. Please email global@uci.edu to request a review.
UC restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal, but such travelers should be aware of travel risks, and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from China.
Returning Travelers from Restricted Regions

CDC is advising returning travelers (during the past 14 days) from South Korea OR China AND who feel sick with fever or cough, or have difficulty breathing to:
Seek medical advice. Call ahead before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
We understand that you may have made plans to travel to China and/or South Korea and booked your trip prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and that you may have family in these countries. Please note that if you travel to China or South Korea, and are respectively a Chinese or Korean national, it is not likely you will be let back into the United States.
For U.S. citizens and permanent residents, you will likely be expected to quarantine for 14 days upon your return. Whether you are under mandatory quarantine or self-quarantine, you will not be allowed back onto the UCI campus until after the quarantine ends. Be aware of how this may affect your attendance at classes, study groups, campus events – and ultimately your grades.
Stay Informed

To be the most informed before your journey, take a look at travel advisory information on these websites:
The website of the World Health Organization is a good place to start. There is a tab for “travel advice” that posts regular updates on locations and how to best protect yourself while traveling. Check out their videos on the subject, too.
The U.S. State Department issues travel advisories for various countries, for many reasons, in addition to COVID-19.
The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has advised Americans to cancel all nonessential travel to China and South Korea, and also provides regular updates regarding other countries where there are cases of COVID-19.

I’m writing to assure you that your health, well-being and academic excellence are our top priorities here at UCI. Since mid-January, a dedicated team on campus and at UCI Health has engaged daily in COVID-19 preparedness activities. The dynamic situation makes it challenging to predict what to expect as the virus’s reach spreads.

We are staying current by operating in lockstep with recommendations from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Campus leaders are in constant contact with the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) and the UC Office of the President.

This preparedness work is no small task, but it’s built on a great foundation developed from past epidemics such as the measles and SARS. Among the on-campus preparedness activities are:

Direct collaboration and partnership among campus, UCI Health and OCHCA to ensure aligned processes and clear communication
Support for students whose main residence is on campus and/or who are unable to return home for any reason during this impacted time. This includes:
A new patient intake and screening process to enhance identification and services at the Student Health Center
Quarantine and isolation plans for student campus housing
Alternative and remote course delivery methods
Identification of and outreach to students, faculty and staff who are abroad and may be in affected areas
Increased custodial services in large gathering areas such as lecture halls and dining facilities
Alternative work options and business continuity plans
Training of medical professionals and first responders on the screening of potentially exposed patients and the use of personal protective equipment
New practices for staff at the Employee Experience Center to manage questions based on individual situations
News reports and social media are raising anxiety levels in all of us. If you need help in managing the stress and concerns, know that the Counseling Center is open to all students, and employees may find guidance through the Employee Assistance Program. Together, we can ensure the peace of mind of our community.

For those who have travel plans during the upcoming spring break, please be sure to check the latest CDC travel guidelines and be aware of potential restrictions on your return. Bernadette Boden-Albala, dean of public health, recently recorded an informative podcast on traveling during difficult times.

Thank you for your continued commitment to observing these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough
Clean and disinfect surfaces often
If you are sick, stay home and do not travel
I am grateful to Dr. Albert Chang and Dr. Bill Wilson for their campus and medical center leadership, respectively, and dedication to our students, patients and community. We are fortunate to have world-class infectious disease and public health researchers at UCI and clinicians at UCI Health – all of whom are determined to mitigate the spread of this virus.

6-Mar-20,658,Irvine,"Dear UCI Community,

UC President Janet Napolitano has issued an amended travel directive based on the latest COVID-19 risk assessment from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). UC students, staff and faculty are to avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to CDC Level 2 countries, in addition to Level 3 countries. Currently:

CDC Level 3 Health Notice Countries are China, Iran, Italy and South Korea
CDC Level 2 Health Notice Countries: defined as those with “sustained community transmission” of COVID-19, includes just Japan, but please go to the CDC site for the most current information.
Further, individuals with a recent travel history from a CDC Level 3 country must self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left the Level 3 country and practice social distancing. CDC travel guidance for Level 3 countries applies to all travelers returning from a Level 3 country for any purpose, including personal travel. CDC is advising returning travelers from a Level 3 country who feel sick with fever or cough, or have difficulty breathing to:

Seek medical advice. Call ahead before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
During this time, anyone who believes their travel to a Level 2 or 3 jurisdiction is essential should contact the UCI International Risk Review Team to request review and approval before travel. Please email global@uci.edu to request a review.

Whether for university business or personal travel, let UCI know if you plan to travel by registering your travel information at UC International Travel Registry. No matter where you travel, always know the status of your visa, and always have some emergency contacts. And, while there, you should also consult the website of the country you are visiting to see what policies are in place. It is emphasized that you should evaluate your trip each day and look for any updates from the local authorities and from the World Health Organization and CDC.

We understand that you may have made plans to travel and booked your trip prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and that you may have family in these countries. Please note that if you travel to a Level 3 risk country, and are a national of the respective countries, it is not likely you will be let back into the United States.

For U.S. citizens and permanent residents, you will likely be expected to quarantine for 14 days upon your return. Whether you are under mandatory quarantine or self-quarantine, you will not be allowed back onto the UCI campus until after the quarantine ends. Be aware of how this may affect your attendance at classes, study groups, campus events — and ultimately your grades.

Additionally, please take into consideration these recommendations:

For domestic travelers: Use caution and judgment before any domestic travel, and check for the latest information from the county health care agency of your destination before your trip.
For large conferences and events:  We are following the guidance of health officials and there is currently no recommendation to avoid attending large conferences on campus. However, we still urge you to use caution and judgment if you decide to attend large conferences.
For incoming visitors to campus: Any visitor arriving to campus from a Level 3 jurisdiction must also follow the CDC guidelines to self-isolate off campus for 14 days since the date they left that country. This also applies to visitors who have been invited to campus on official university business.
For more tips about traveling at this time, visit the CDC Travel FAQ page.  Please also be sure to visit UCI’s COVID-19 website often as new resources are being posted regularly.

Thank you for your continued cooperation in protecting the UCI community.

6-Mar-20,470,Irvine,"Dear Middle Earth and Mesa Court Residents,

Among the proactive measures taken on campus to safeguard student health, UCI Dining has made a few changes that will reduce risk factors for contagion of coronavirus and other seasonal viruses. For example, you may notice in The Anteatery and Brandywine dining commons that self-serve stations, such as the salad bar, are now staffed with servers. There will also be two To-Go programs available for residents who prefer to eat their meals in their rooms or halls. And we will be increasing the frequency with which customer-facing areas such as dining tables, door handles, and food counters are wiped down.  There are no reported cases of corornavirus at UC Irvine, and our hope is that these preventive measures will reduce student concerns about potential exposure in group facilities. 

Peter’s To-Go Meals

Residents may pick up a to-go boxed meal at the cashier station at the Anteatery or Brandywine during breakfast, lunch, and dinner for one meal swipe per to-go boxed meal. Each boxed meal will include a protein, vegetable, starch, dessert, fruit and a drink. Vegetarian and Vegan entrees will be available upon request. Peter’s To-Go Meals may not be for dine-in. 

Reusable To-Go Container and Cup Program

Residents may visit the Anteatery or Brandywine and ask for a reusable to-go container and/or cup. For one meal swipe, residents can fill their reusable to go container with any items being served in our dining facilities to later enjoy in their rooms or halls. They can then return the dirty container or cup for a clean one or request a rain check card for future use. This reusable to-go program may not be for dine-in.

In addition to the to-go programs, Dining has also made a few other changes to the stations to help prevent the spread of viruses.

The Dining staff will be serving food at previous self-serve station to minimize the touching of tongs, serving spoons and ladles. Reusable cups and utensils will be provided at the cashier and food stations. Guests will be given a cup and utensils at the cashier station after they swipe in. Gloves will also be available upon request.
Signage will be posted at previous self-serve stations and throughout the dining facilities with these changes.
Dining staff will wipe down customer facing areas such as dining tables, door handles, food counters, sneeze guards, condiment bottles, etc. more frequently in all dining facilities. 
We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. Please direct any questions to our food services managers at the Anteatery and Brandywine or via email at food@uci.edu.

8-Mar-20,952,Irvine,"Dear UCI community,

Since my last message, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has increased significantly across the U.S. We expect this number will continue to climb with more widespread testing. It is also reasonable to assume that, at some point, there will be a confirmed case within our region, and perhaps within our campus community. Understandably, these possibilities lead to elevated worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in higher-risk populations.

Campus Status 
The campus continues to remain open and is operating normally. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported at UCI, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully and assess the local impact with our partners from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Orange County Health Care Agency. 

After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend ordinary instructional activity. In-person classroom meetings will be under normal operation for the week of March 9th.

We are aware that a small number of other universities, with different local circumstances, have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our local situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the State Department of Public Health, Orange County officials, university health officials, and UC Office of the President.

While we are not ending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we do understand the value of increased “social distancing” as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus. Today, in partnership with the Academic Senate, we are encouraging instructors to exercise flexibility and to adjust their course practices and policies to accommodate students who cannot attend in-person classes or take in-person finals during the remaining two weeks of the quarter.

Faculty have already begun planning to ensure that Spring instruction will proceed even if illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions prevent students or an instructor from coming to campus. If the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings. But that is not the situation we face at this time.

Operational Continuity 
As we consider future developments, faculty and staff should take steps to prepare for the possibility of a reduced campus operation, should that become necessary, including instruction, events, seminars, and other university business to be conducted fully online or remotely. 

While no decisions have been made yet to close large gatherings such as concerts, sporting events, conventions, or large community events, this remains a possibility for the future. As such, organizers should exercise key prevention strategies in your events operation plan.

Even if the campus needs to move to a hybrid or completely virtual instruction model, for planning purposes the campus community should assume that the campus will remain open in other ways. Additional details will be provided at the time, but we expect buildings will be open and faculty will have access to their offices, labs, and classroom facilities. On-campus housing will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases within on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials should it become necessary. Dining services in residence halls will also continue to serve students with meal plans.

Travel Considerations 
Additionally, students, faculty and staff should consider seriously whether personal travel is necessary at this time. If you are to leave for international travel now or at spring break, then you should understand there are real restrictions on getting back to the U.S., as well as the potential challenges of getting flights back home. Domestic travel is currently easier, but we are seeing a reduction in service in travel routes. While we can hope that transportation hubs will remain open, we cannot predict that will be the case upon your return to campus. 

Travel restrictions will become stricter as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase and high-risk Level 2-3 regions are identified. Whether you travel abroad or locally, you should be prepared to arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return should you return from a restricted jurisdiction (International or Domestic) or are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID-19. Other unanticipated restrictions may apply as public health officials monitor the situation.

Your Health & Wellness 
Should you need support to manage this difficult time, the Counseling Center is open to all students, and employees may find guidance through the Employee Assistance Program.

As a reminder, we recommend observing these simple tips to help stay well:

Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Stop touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Instead of shaking hands, find alternate ways to greet people.
Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough.
Clean and disinfect surfaces often.
If you are sick, stay home and do not travel. 
Call ahead before visiting your doctor or the Student Health Center to arrange a time to be seen.
Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UCI at the COVID-19 webpage. We will continue to make regular updates to FAQs and details about modified campus operations as new information is available.

I remain committed to ensuring that UCI delivers a world-class education while prioritizing the health and safety of our community. Thank you for doing your part to protect our community."
10-Mar-20,750,Irvine,"Dear Anteaters,

UCI has learned that we now have a member of our campus community who is considered a person under investigation (PUI) for potentially testing positive for COVID-19. This individual was seen by the Student Health Center, where their arrival was coordinated to avoid exposure to others and where they could be safely tested for COVID-19. The test was sent to the Orange County Health Care Agency, and we should know the results within 36 hours. This individual is now under self-quarantine off campus until we learn the results. 

As a continued commitment to the health of our campus, we have been screening, testing and following up on all cases that meet criteria. We currently have several cases that we are following very closely with the Orange County Health Care Agency, and we will be sure to inform our community of any updates and changes.

In addition to partnering with the County for COVID-19 preparedness and testing, UCI has contracted with Quest for increased testing ability. Through this level of increased testing, we will be able to expand the number of tests we will be able to perform, which will help us manage our resources. 

While we have increased capability for testing, please remember there are still specific criteria we consider prior to testing for COVID-19. Students who feel that they have been exposed or are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should call the Student Health Center/or your physician’s office for further guidance. Staff and faculty should contact their primary care provider or call ahead to an urgent care center before arriving in person.

If you feel ill or think that you qualify for testing, contact your provider BEFORE going into the clinic. And please consider using Live Health Online, a newly offered USHIP covered service that connects you via a TELE-MEDICINE visit with a provider online, from the convenience of your home, 24 hours a day. See the details here:https://shc.uci.edu/services/livehealth-online

Also note that, effective March 9, 2020, UC SHIP will reduce the student cost share to $0 for all medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with directives issued last week by the CA Department of Managed Care and the CA Department of Insurance. Cost sharing includes, but is not limited to, copays, deductibles or coinsurance. Medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19 may include hospital (including emergency department), urgent care visits, provider office visits and/or telehealth encounters (e.g., LiveHealth Online) where the purpose of the visit is to be screened and/or tested for COVID-19. 

For students who qualify based on the criteria above, and if those students pay out of pocket costs related to COVID-19 services to hospitals, urgent care centers, LiveHealth Online or other providers, Anthem will reimburse the student (i.e., copay, coinsurance). The student can reach out to Anthem directly or they may contact the Student Health Center Billing or Insurance Departments for assistance in obtaining reimbursement.

For students who have health insurance coverage other than UC SHIP, we encourage you to contact your insurance carrier directly for information related to your benefits and out-of-pocket costs associated with COVID-19 services. While LiveHealth Online is available to all registered students, those students who have health insurance other than UC SHIP may have a tele-health option available to them through their own health insurance plan.

We continue to encourage students to be healthy and to refrain from attending classes if they are unwell. And if you are feeling ill, you may contact your professors directly, or you may complete an Intake Form at the Disability Services Center to request accommodations for any clinically approved extended absences. https://dsc.uci.edu/register/

We realize this is a stressful time and many of you are feeling anxious. Everyone should continue to follow the guidance for regular handwashing with soap, getting plenty of sleep, eating healthy, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, along with adhering to the new guidance for social distancing – or keeping several feet of space between yourself and those around you in public, when feasible.

Please do not hesitate to call the Student Health Center or your physician if you would like to arrange a medical visit, and explore the Live Health Online option for a virtual visit. And please refer to the COVID-19 webpage for UCI information and updates.

We will send out another campus update when test results are received.

10-Mar-20,924,Irvine,"Dear UCI community,

With finals week just around the corner and the uncertainty of the impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hovering, I write to share definitive actions that the campus is taking effective immediately, and until further notice.

These decisions are made in support of the concept of “social distancing,” which is a public health concept to reduce the probability of contact between individuals who are or may be carrying a highly contagious disease. Social distancing – which can be effective with as little as a six-feet gap between individuals – helps to prevent infections that are transmitted by droplet (such as coughing, sneezing or touching a contaminated surface). Science shows that reducing the concentration of people in an area can lower the infection risk for everyone involved. The following actions are designed to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings.

Academic Instruction

As I mentioned in my March 8 message, while instruction for this week continues to take place in person, instructors are directed to exercise flexibility and to adjust their course practices and policies to accommodate students who cannot attend in-person classes over the next few days.
Final exams next week will be administered remotely. Departments and instructors should work together to determine the most appropriate solutions for finishing courses and assigning grades, putting student health and success first in their decision making. 
We are transitioning to a remote learning mode for Spring quarter. In limited cases, such as courses involving a lab, studio instruction, or clinical experiences, instructors will need to make accommodations to meet the course requirements whether in person or via an alternative delivery mode. Deans and department chairs will communicate these exceptions by the end of the week after consulting with the provost office. Otherwise, students will be able to receive instruction through distance learning options. 
Graduate students will transition to remote work whenever possible and may also continue work in research labs after consulting with their faculty and departments. Instructional tools and classrooms remain available for hosting online meetings, seminars, and course development. Access to research spaces and other resources necessary for graduate work will continue.
Students living on campus are strongly encouraged to return to their off-campus residences and, if possible, and to stay at home during the Spring quarter. As described above, Winter quarter final exams and Spring quarter instruction will be available to students living remotely. Students who remain in on-campus housing for the Spring will also receive instruction remotely and should be prepared for reduced on-campus activities and interactions. Dining services will remain open, with modified service options. The Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs will offer guidance on student services and housing in a separate message tomorrow and will create a process for identifying students who wish to move off campus for the remainder of the academic year.
UCI Health remains fully operational. Employees should follow guidance sent from medical center leadership. Students, residents, fellows and faculty members in the schools of the Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences will be receiving discipline-specific guidance.
Campus Events & Visits

All events and gatherings with more than 100 participants are to be canceled. Where possible, you are encouraged to deliver the event in an alternative format. For campus events that continue as scheduled, it is advised that organizers exercise key prevention strategies in event operation plans. Gatherings of less than 100 may also be inconsistent with the practice of social distancing if not properly organized.
Departments should not require visiting scholars and recruited faculty or graduate students to attend in-person meetings on campus. Necessary interviews and presentations should be done remotely.
All UCI Athletics events and competitions will continue as closed events. As such there will be no spectators or fans at these events.
Business Continuity

Importantly, the campus is not closing. Campus offices will remain open and most operations will continue. Employees who need to work remotely should contact supervisors for approval. Guidance for supervisors is forthcoming from Human Resources.
UCI is restricting all non-essential University-sponsored travel – international or domestic, particularly by air or train. Any UCI sponsored travel will require a vice chancellor, dean or chief officer approval. You are encouraged to find alternate means of conducting business as we work to help limit the potential spread of infection to other areas.
Office of Research has developed guidelines for assumptions in continuity planning that include reduction in available personnel, handling of experiments and data, and research management support. Guidance and information is forthcoming.
Understandably, there will be many questions in the days ahead. We are all committed to getting you timely information quickly, and with as much clarity as possible. However, I recognize that no number of messages or FAQs can answer every question, especially those with uniquely individual circumstances. We have established the UCI Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response Center. Students, staff, faculty, parents, and community partners may call 949-824-9918 or email covid19@uci.edu to connect directly for more information.

While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the UCI community at this time, those with symptoms, especially if they have visited high-risk areas, are encouraged to call their medical providers or the Student Health Center. I encourage you to revisit our previous communications and tips for staying well on the COVID-19 updates webpage.

Thank you for your commitment to a healthy UCI community. Please remember to stay well and look out for each other."
10-Mar-20,222,Irvine,"Dear Anteaters,

Since my last communication with you, we have received good news. The Orange County Health Care Agency informed us that the person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 tested negative. 

The Student Health Center has received a number of inquiries asking for information about the movement of the individual who was under investigation. In this week’s case, the campus quickly identified where the PUI had been and notified those individuals who were in close proximity with them, including classmates. Should we have any further cases of PUIs at UCI, we will be practicing the same outreach measures to ensure those that are most likely to be at risk are aware of the details and counseled on proper actions to take in order to minimize spreading the virus responsible for COVID-19.

As a reminder, if students feel ill or that you meet specific criteria for testing, please call the Student Health Center or physician’s office for further guidance. Students may also consider using LiveHealth Online, from the convenience of your home, 24 hours a day. Staff and faculty should contact their primary care provider or call ahead to an urgent care center before arriving in person.

11-Mar-20,213,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues,

As faculty prepare to deliver more instruction online, this is a good time to review our university policies concerning ownership of course materials and some steps faculty can take to protect them. 

The University of California’s 2003 policy on Ownership of Course Materials describes in detail ownership of course materials in whatever medium or combination thereof and includes, but is not limited to, lectures, lecture notes and materials, syllabi, study guides, and web-ready content. In brief, unless you have used “exceptional university resources” to create course materials, you own the copyrights to the course materials you create. This means that only the faculty member and anyone to whom the faculty member has granted permission may reproduce, distribute, or display course materials. 

Rules relating to the distribution of course recordings are described in the University of California’s 2005 policy on Use of Recordings of Course Presentations. In sum, only legitimate pedagogical and instructional uses by enrolled students and by faculty are allowed.

For more details on these topics and about how to protect your materials, please see DTEI’s Guidance for UCI Faculty in Light of Increased Online Instruction (COVID-19).

As the campus responds in real time to the coronavirus threat, we wanted to reach out and thank you for the amazing level of understanding you have displayed. We know that the new procedures regarding social distancing are impacting many aspects of your daily lives, and we want to assure you that maintaining a high quality of education is our top priority.

At this point, there are some concrete steps you can take to prepare for final exams. First, I want to emphasize that the campus is covering the costs for remote proctoring for Examity and Respondus. Faculty have received these instructions as well. Please go to this link to confirm you have the correct equipment, additional options will be available if you do not. This is a live document and will be regularly updated, so please check back regularly. Second, and most importantly, make sure you have clarity on your instructor’s plan, because each instructor is in charge of her or his own course. Finally, courses are likely to use remote proctoring. We have created a landing page that will point you to a wide set of resources here. Technical information about resources for remote exams and instruction are available at: https://techprep.oit.uci.edu/learning/. If you do not have proper resources, please reach out to your instructor as soon as possible so we can ensure the correct resources are in place.

In preparation for the spring quarter, know that we are offering the full spectrum of courses. As you plan for Spring quarter, make sure to reach out to instructors if you have any questions. It is critical to check with faculty about the tools/modes they will use to ensure you will be able to engage fully in the course. Many courses will be using either Zoom or Yuja to deliver remote content. Please familiarize yourself with any instructions for use of these tools (start here for information). Information on accommodating students who do not have access to these tools will be available soon.

As your instructors decide on new ways to administer final exams and to deliver spring courses in a remote format, we hope that you’ll continue to be flexible and patient. Instructors are working to address these challenges in real time, and best health practices are our current top priority.  Please consider that there are many logistical challenges to overcome and that no alternative is perfect. If you feel, however, that there are issues that your instructor may not have considered, feel free to reach out to them in a respectful manner or contact the Student Affairs Office in your School.

In summary, here is the regularly updated document with course/instruction related resources for students.

Yours,"
12-Mar-20,467,Irvine,"A key component of the campus social distancing, remote teaching, and telework strategy is using the powerful remote meeting tool Zoom. Zoom can be used to host and attend remote instruction, hold meetings, and collaborate digitally with colleagues, classmates, and friends. Zoom can be used on any computer, tablet, or mobile phone.

We would like to announce the immediate availability of Zoom enterprise licensing for all UCI faculty, staff, and students. Zoom meetings will allow up to 300 attendees per session over an unlimited number of minutes. You can facilitate interactive meetings in real-time, video chat, create polls, screen share, and share documents. Live sessions can also be recorded and distributed to enable access by participants who are unable to attend live sessions.

12-Mar-20,403,Irvine,"EVENT POLICIES AMENDMENT COVID-19
Effective March 12 – June 30, 2020

This is an amendment to the following UCI policies and procedures:

Sec. 900-15: UCI Major Events Policy,
Sec. 900-10: Policy on Use and Scheduling of UC Irvine Properties, and
Sec. 900-11: Guidelines for Scheduling Campus Properties through Student Center & Event Services,
which all implement PACAOS 40.00 Policy on Use of University Properties.

This policy applies to all UCI faculty, staff, students, residents, fellows, volunteers, visitors and contractors.

A. Policy

UCI should consider conducting business (gatherings of any size) using alternate methods (for example, virtual events.)
Social distancing should be practiced at all times.
Events with anticipated attendance of 100 or more must be canceled to reduce the risk of potential spread of infection.
Reservations may not be accepted for events with 100 or more participants for dates on or before June 12, 2020.
Reservations for events with 100 or more participants for dates between June 13, 2020 and September 27, 2020 must include a provision allowing the University, at its sole discretion, to terminate or cancel the reservation.
B. Policy Exceptions

If you believe your event of 100 people or more merits an exception to this policy, consult with Environmental Health & Safety.
• Initiate your inquiry by completing the UC Irvine COVID-19 Registration of University Events form.
_ Include an explanation of why the event is necessary and the consequence of not having or not attending the event.
EH&S will work with you to assess the risks from a public health perspective.
Any exceptions to this policy must be obtained prior to the event and documented.
Only deans, vice chancellors, or associate chancellors may approve such exceptions.
If exceptional approval is granted, social distancing should be practiced. Additionally, extraordinary venue cleaning will be required during and after the event. These additional cleaning services will be determined during the EH&S assessment. Such services may include items such as having dedicated Facilities Management staff to provide supplemental cleaning during the event.
C. Cancelled Events

Impacts of cancelled events can be substantial. It is important to document all costs of cancelled events including loss of (anticipated) revenue, fees/costs associated with rebooking and cancellations, broken contracts, MOU’s, and other event obligations. Cost impacts of cancelled events should be recorded with supporting documentation by the event organizers. These records should be kept locally for possible future reimbursement, though such reimbursement cannot be guaranteed."
13-Mar-20,310,Irvine,"Dear Students, Parents and Families,

The administration, faculty and staff at UCI are working diligently to ensure continuity of education while protecting the health and welfare of our community. Today, we are writing to acknowledge the many questions and concerns about final exams and the determination of grades for winter quarter. We recognize that the lack of concrete information can be frustrating. Please know that we are doing everything we can to provide students the resources and support they need to provide as smooth a conclusion to the winter quarter as possible. 

Next week, we will be administering final exams remotely, with reliable proctoring software or other similarly secure mechanisms that safeguards the integrity of the process. Faculty have a considerable amount of discretion in their choice of alternative methods of assessment. Given this, final assignments may be given in a variety of ways. Students should be on the lookout for instructions on final exams and alternative final assignments from their instructors.

Only individual faculty members have the requisite information about their classes, their students, and about how assessment has taken place during the rest of the quarter. Given the rapidly evolving situation, please understand that faculty are working to make these adjustments as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience as the campus works diligently to provide students with the resources and information they need during this time. Maintaining the fairness and accuracy of grades is essential, and we are committed to a manner of alternative course and exam delivery that is fully in keeping with our academic and instructional mission. 

We will be communicating regularly so that you have the most up-to-date information about campus operations. Please know that a housing and dining fee message is coming soon from UCI's Student Affairs division.

I am writing as a follow-up to Chancellor Gillman’s email sent on March 10, 2020 regarding the change in campus operations to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to our UCI community. As the Chancellor mentioned in his message, the efforts we are undertaking are based on our concern for the public’s health and safety. We do not take these changes lightly and appreciate your understanding as we navigate this evolving environment.

Student Housing and Meal Plans
Students in all campus housing, including the American Campus Communities, are strongly encouraged to go to their permanent residence if they are able. If you are a financial aid recipient and decide to leave campus, federal law requires us to change your financial aid award.

For students that decide not to continue their room & board or rental agreements for Spring Quarter 2020, there will be no penalty to cancel your lease. A separate message to lease holders will be sent with instructions on informing us of your decision. You will need to inform us of your decision to continue or cancel your lease by Wednesday, March 18, 2020, at 5 p.m. PDT.

Student Life
All events and student activities scheduled on campus with 100 or more attendees are cancelled until further notice. If an event is less than 100 attendees, event organizers are strongly encouraged to deliver the event in an alternative format. It is also important to note that gatherings of less than 100 attendees may also be inconsistent with the practice of social distancing if not properly organized. Therefore, we strongly encourage that all events, even those with less than 100 attendees, be delivered in an alternative format and, if not possible, canceled or postponed.

The UCI Student Center and Anteater Recreation Center remain open at this time. Student services such as the UCI Counseling Center, UCI Student Health Center, Disability Services Center, and FRESH Basic Needs Hub remain open to support students, but will be reassessed in early spring. While campus services remain open, students should know that offices may implement procedures to minimize contact, such as providing services remotely. We recommend that students visit their websites first for information on accessing services.

UCI Commencement
We are saddened to share that the UCI Commencement Ceremonies will not take place in the same way as previous years. We advise families not to make arrangements to come to the campus for the Commencement celebrations. We are actively looking at alternatives to celebrate our graduates in an appropriate manner. We understand that commencement is an important part of the UCI experience and we want to honor our students while still keeping our community safe. Graduating students should look for a separate message from the UCI Commencement office with details and information in the coming weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.

Thank you for your patience and understanding during these difficult times. Information on COVID-19 will be posted on https://uci.edu/coronavirus/

To assist UCI’s research community with keeping informed about evolving circumstances, emerging guidance and information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on UCI’s research enterprise, the Office of Research (OR) has launched a Research Continuity website.  This resource is intended to be a location where researchers and their support staff can go to get answers to their questions.  Given that circumstances are very fluid at this point, the website and its contents are living documents, and will be updated regularly.  Therefore, I strongly encourage you to refer to this website often.

I am also writing to inform you that OR has developed Human Research Continuity guidance, which is available on the Research Continuity website.  This information includes the status of IRB/HRPP operations, operational priorities, and guidance on COVID-19 screening of research subjects prior to study appointments.  It also clarifies that practicing social distancing practices used in lieu of in-person interactions does not require an IRB approved modification prior to implementation.  This guidance also includes important general guidance for clinical research.

OR is committed to providing the UCI research community with important information and developments regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UCI research through regular messaging and the Research Continuity website.  Please direct any questions regarding OR’s continuity plans to Bruce Morgan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Administration at bruce.morgan@uci.edu or 949-824-5677.  Questions regarding ULAR’s continuity plan should be directed to Claire Lindsell at claire.lindsell@uci.edu or 949-824-0569.

16-Mar-20,321,Irvine,"Dear UCI Students,

We are writing to follow up on our announcement regarding the status of the 2020 Commencement Ceremonies. As we mentioned in our campuswide email on March 13, we are saddened by the decision to cancel the ceremonies for the graduating class of 2020. In consultation with public health experts and given the serious health concerns, we could not risk the safety and security of our students, parents and families. While some may believe that Coronavirus and resulting COVID_19 disease will subside in a few months, given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus, the risk is too great to the community to assemble large gatherings such as UCI Commencement.

We are in the process of exploring two alternatives at this time. One possibility is a virtual ceremony. This idea is still in early development but updates will be provided in the coming weeks. In place of the June Commencement program, we are beginning our planning to hold in_person Commencement Ceremonies during the Winter 2020 recess that occurs mid-December 2020. This plan is contingent on our public health status at that time. Please keep in mind that there is still a possibility that we would not be able to hold the program.

We understand that the Commencement experience is about celebrating with family and loved ones a significant milestone in your personal and academic development. While the formal pomp and circumstance will not take place in June, we hope that we can create an experience that honors the commitment and sacrifice made by you and your family. We ask for your patience and understanding as we continue to find solutions during these unprecedented times.

17-Mar-20,256,Irvine,"Dear Cove Friends,

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate this health crisis. The last few days have remarkably changed the way we do business and engage as a community. The Cove – designed to be a collaborative and public gathering space – has closed its public operations out of an abundance of caution and in line with current best practices for public spaces. We expect to reopen on April 6, 2020.

All programming in the Cove is suspended and on-site services will not be available. Our diligent Beall Applied Innovation team is now online and working from home, available to offer support and information via phone or video meeting. We have asked our Wayfinder startup teams and Cove partner tenants to also work remotely.

UCI’s priority remains the health and welfare of the campus and community members at large and the Cove’s actions are similar to our schools and research centers. For the most current campus updates and other resources, you can visit uci.edu/coronavirus. This website is refreshed throughout each day.

We’re all adjusting to what is hopefully a very short-term “new normal”. Our efforts to support the modern American Dream and regional economic vitality will be needed more than ever once this moment passes. Though we may be practicing social distancing, we look forward to remaining digitally connected for now, continuing our work of fueling new innovations and opportunities. Thank you for your continued support.
 

Stay Healthy,

17-Mar-20,1164,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues:

The COVID-19 crisis and the rapidly-changing circumstances associated with it are presenting unprecedented challenges to our research enterprise.  UCI’s research community has risen to these challenges, and I greatly appreciate all that you have done so far in response to this crisis. 

Driven by the rapidly escalating situation in the State of California, we now need to ramp down and curtail our on-campus research activities. Specifically, at this time, we need to do two things:

Effective immediately implement plans to ramp down non-critical research through May 1.  This must be accomplished by close of business on Friday, March 20.  To the extent feasible, non-critical research should be shifted to remote operations (i.e., home), or postponed to a later date.  From March 21 through May 1, only critical research will be conducted at UCI.  This period may be adjusted based on circumstances as they evolve.
Ensure that the human physical distance in our research operations exceeds the social distancing guidelines.
Principal Investigators (PIs), Lead Researchers (LRs) and lab managers should immediately begin this process and share their strategy with their department/school/research unit leadership.

CRITICAL v. NON-CRITICAL RESEARCH
Critical research activities means essential experiments and the essential personnel to carry them out. These activities are in most cases experimental research in university laboratories.

Essential experiments are:

Those for which cessation would be in conflict with funding agreements (consult with personnel in SPA or Beall Applied Innovation as applicable to assist you with determining if this is the case);
Where the phasing down and restarting of the research would cause irreparable harm to the research project/program; or
Related to improving general knowledge about the SARS CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 illness), and reducing the spread of COVID-19, including the development and testing of vaccine candidates.  
Essential experiments by definition include clinical trials, i.e., the controlled, clinical testing in human subjects of investigational new drugs, devices, treatments or diagnostics, or comparisons of approved drugs, devices, treatments or diagnostics, to assess their safety, efficacy, benefits, costs, adverse reactions, and/or outcomes.

Essential personnel are those individuals who are necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of critical research, including:

Laboratory personnel responsible for animal care, where such care is not provided by ULAR,
Personnel responsible for equipment maintenance that, if not done, could result in damage or high-cost equipment repairs (e.g., maintaining cryogen on NMR spectrometers),
Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion (e.g., the ability to make a specific measurement only a few times a year), and
Faculty and/or research staff necessary to maintain research materials that are perishable and not easily replaced.  For example, primary cell lines, and long-term experiments for which there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end (e.g., on-going, continual one-month experiment that requires regular measurements or maintenance otherwise all previous data is lost).
Please note that students (including graduate students and post-docs) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel; the decision to report to campus lies with the student worker, not their research advisor.

Preparing to Reduce Research Personnel Density
You may wish to use the Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist, adapted from peer institutions, to evaluate necessary steps in reducing research personnel density.  Please note that this is not an all-encompassing list, or a list for which all items will apply to a specific type of research or research in a specific discipline.  Rather, it is intended as a general tool to help inform researchers and focus their thoughts in preparing their plans and strategies.  As a reminder, the UC Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes).

Human Subjects Research
The general guidance posted on the Research Continuity website under the Human Research Protections section remains current, and should be carefully reviewed and followed by all researchers engaged in human research.

Research Personnel Health and Safety
The health and safety of UCI research personnel is a top priority.  PIs and LRs are responsible for encouraging all research personnel, including undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs to work from home whenever feasible.  They are also responsible for encouraging and modeling social distancing and good hygiene. 

Any researcher (regardless of their position or rank) must not come to work if they are sick.  This includes essential personnel, which is why redundancy in all aspects of preparedness planning (and especially in communication plans) is vitally important.  Be sure to establish a system by which research team members can and will check the status of each other.  We must look after not only our physical health, but also consider mental health and the impact that a pandemic event can have on our most valuable asset – the immensely creative and dedicated people that make up UCI’s research community.

We are facing an unprecedented challenge with COVID-19, and all of us must all do our part to “flatten the curve” to protect our community and lessen predictable pressures on our public health infrastructure.   While this process may be disheartening, know that the steps you take now will support the long-term success of our labs and research groups.

For questions regarding the ramp down and curtailment and how these actions may impact research, please direct them to the following:

For sponsored awards, please direct them to the officer in Sponsored Projects Administration or Beall Applied Innovation assigned to your unit, or to Nancy Lewis, Executive Director, Sponsored Projects Administration at nrlewis@uci.edu.
For human research, please direct them to the staff in Human Research Protections, or to Beverley Alberola, Director, Human Research Protections at beverley.alberola@uci.edu.
For animal protocols, please direct them to IACUC@uci.edu.

You have either not responded to the “Spring Quarter 2020 – Housing Plans” survey or have indicated in the survey that you intend to remain in campus housing for spring quarter. For those who have not responded, please respond to the survey by Wednesday, March 18.

The public health concerns in the United States continue to escalate. We strongly urge students who are able to safely return to their permanent residence to do so by Sunday, March 29, and plan to remain there for the remainder of the academic year. Exceptions to stay in campus housing beyond Sunday, March 29 will be made for students who meet one of the following: 

Do not have access to alternate housing;

Have economic needs that do not enable them to return to their permanent residence;

Can not relocate due to personal health or safety considerations;

Have permanent residences in areas highly impacted by COVID-19; or

Have other situations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 


Important:

Food service will be limited, and meals that are served will be “grab and go”

There will be no labs or studios open

The Anteater Recreation Center (ARC) will be closed for the foreseeable future

Shuttle services will be limited and some service routes cancelled

Campus events have been cancelled

Dorm rooms and living communities may be adjusted to comply with social distancing regulations

Graduation is cancelled, and

In the event you are quarantined due to illness or exposure, enforcement will be coordinated with county officials


While some of these measures might sound extreme, they are consistent with California Health and Safety Code regulations recently released for Orange County, effective immediately, through March 31, 2020. Those restrictions include prohibition of “all public and private gatherings of any number of people, including at places of work, occurring outside a single household or living unit” unless they are engaged in “Essential Activities.” The regulations do permit colleges and universities to continue to be at work “for purposes of facilitating distance learning or performing essential functions, provided that Social Distancing of six feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.”  Violation of this Order is subject to fine, imprisonment, or both. (California Health and Safety Code section 120295.)

If the information provided here has given you a different outlook on staying versus leaving campus and you wish to change a previous survey response, you may do so up until 5 p.m. on Wednesday, March 18. Anyone who decides to move out of Student Housing must also check out and turn in keys to the housing office in their community.

Wishing everyone a healthy and secure spring quarter, wherever you are learning.

18-Mar-20,747,Irvine,"Dear On-Campus Student Residents,

I am writing to follow up on two critical items related to financial aid and housing. In a March 13 message to students, it was stated that on-campus student residents choosing to return home for the Spring quarter could impact their financial aid packages. Today, the U.S. Department of Education has informed us that student aid packages will not need to be adjusted, should you choose to return to your permanent residence for Spring quarter.

We understand that some on-campus student residents have made decisions not to return to their permanent residence based on previous information. Given the news that financial aid packages will not be impacted by changes in housing status, I write to reiterate the message sent from Tim Trevan, Executive Director of UCI Housing. Our developing public health circumstance compels our decision: if you are able to return safely to your permanent residence, you must do so.

Please understand that these decisions are not easy to make, and are made in consideration of keeping our students, staff, and faculty healthy. As our founding Dean of Public Health, Bernadette Boden-Albala, has emphasized over the last several weeks, we all have a responsibility to do what is required to promote public health during the current emergency.

It is a public health threat for large numbers of students to reside in a contained campus living environment. If students do not return to their permanent residences at higher numbers, then there is a higher risk to all residents of acquiring COVID-19, merely because of the higher number of people in the immediate surroundings. It is also more likely that residents will make others sick, including those in populations that are more vulnerable. More significantly, we want to help ensure that you do not become a threat to your loved ones.  

Keep in mind that the resources you need for your academic success will be available to you wherever you decide to learn from in the Spring quarter. All classes will be taught remotely. Student services are also offered remotely. Additionally, there will be no campus events for the Spring quarter as any gathering inconsistent with social distancing will be restricted. In-person and on-campus resources have ramped down to minimal operations. Dining halls will only be serving boxed meals.

If you are an on-campus student resident and do not have a permanent residence to return to, we will work with you. You are part of the UCI family, and we are committed to finding a solution so you can have adequate housing.  

Not all on-campus student residents will be able to return safely to their permanent residence. There are multiple factors that we understand will require some students to remain in on-campus housing. For these reasons, if you are able to return safely to your permanent residence, you make it possible for us to create a much safer environment for those who do not have that option.

I understand that some of you may need a little more time to finalize your decision. I am issuing a directive to extend the deadline for you to inform us to Friday, March 20 by 5 p.m. If you already indicated you are staying, but would like to adjust your plans to return home or move off-campus, please update your survey response. We will work with you to ensure that you receive the proper refunds and fee adjustments. If you have a lease with ACC, please follow ACC’s process to cancel your lease as ACC has agreed to allow UCI students to terminate their lease early without a cancelation penalty or rent being charged once you have left the unit.

Please stay up-to-date on the campus status at uci.edu/coronavirus. Should you need support, counseling, or other help, please reference the Coronavirus Information Hub for resources to manage through this difficult time.

I thank everyone for their commitment and attention. Making these personal adjustments is an act of community citizenship and compassion and I appreciate your flexibility and understanding during this difficult time.

Since the day this virus was first recognized, UCI Health researchers and medical experts have worked closely with other hospitals and healthcare providers – regionally and across the nation – sharing best practices while staying current with the latest information, treatments and tools. The medical community is pulling together, with UCI Health at the nexus, and Orange County is safer for it.

We are fortunate to have one of the world’s finest academic and medical institutions in our backyard, ready to protect the community with the best medical professionals, educators and researchers. Together with our partners throughout the University of California, we stand ready to serve."
19-Mar-20,435,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues,

We would like to share a reminder about keeping your personal devices secure, especially as more of us are working remotely and using them to access UCI institutional data and resources. These cyber risk avoidance tips are applicable to both your personal life and work life at UCI. As remote work becomes the norm for now, let’s ensure that we are safe and healthy, both physically and digitally.

Personal Device Security

Keep your devices patched with the latest security updates, don’t use end-of-life operating systems.
Be mindful of going to “risky” sites, installing “risky” software, clicking “risky” links, or responding to “risky” emails. Double-check everything and only go to trusted sites, use trusted software, and respond to trusted contacts.
Run anti-virus/anti-malware software with latest updates if your operating system supports it.
Enable your operating system’s host-based firewall.
Don’t login to your device using an “administrator” account, instead use a normal non-privileged user account if your device supports it to limit the impact of potential compromises.
Don’t store passwords unencrypted on your device (use a secure vault like LastPass instead http://oit.uci.edu/help/lastpass).
If using a mobile device, enable encryption with strong passwords.
Working Remote Securely

Don’t copy P3 or P4 data to your personal device, even if temporarily. Use remote sessions to university managed devices instead. (What is P3 or P4 data? Please see https://security.uci.edu/security-plan/plan-classification-protection.html#P3 to learn more).
Enable session timeout and lock screen with a strong password to keep roommates, spouses, kids from disturbing your work.
Enable your home Internet router's firewall to block incoming connections from the Internet by default.
Ensure that your wireless connections are encrypted with a strong password.
Generate and securely store your Duo Emergency Backup Codes ahead of time, in case your Duo device becomes inaccessible, so that you can still work without needing to contact the OIT Help Desk https://applications.oit.uci.edu/DuoSupportDesk/backupCodes.htm
Many campus administrative resources require use of the VPN to access from off-campus, however only stay connected to the VPN as needed in order to conserve resources for others.
Contact the security team if you believe a computer, user account, or data may have been breached https://security.uci.edu/incident.html

19-Mar-20,916,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues, 

As we prepare for a spring quarter of remote teaching, I write to remind you about the online resources and professional development assistance at your disposal. In addition, I want to highlight ways that Schools are leveraging faculty and graduate student expertise. I strongly urge all of you to work together and share insights into unexplored ways to use technology.  

Jumping into remote teaching is not ideal for any of us, I have confidence in the creativity and resilience of the UCI instructional staff._ I am confident in our ability to channel our research talents to the challenge of this current crisis to serve our students as best we can, given our constraints._ 

As you start planning your quarter, keep in mind the following:  

1.    Some things will go wrong — they always do. Be up front with your students about this from the beginning and engage them in the process. Help them understand that they are part of the process of navigating and solving the challenges before us as we model flexibility, creativity, and scholarship at its best._ 

2.    We have created a quick guide to help you start this process. We are not creating fully online courses. We are taking what we do every day and translating it into a new remote medium to minimize harms during a crisis. The translation will not be perfect, but it can still provide a high-quality educational experience and keeps us all safer. You will even find some things that work better. Bring those best practices back to classroom teaching in the future. Finally, unlike a fully online course, it does not have to be complete on day one of the quarter – it will evolve throughout the quarter._ 

3.    Use spring break for test runs of the technology for you and your students. If you are going to use Canvas, have the Canvas course created and published early. It can take up to an hour for the Canvas course to be created once you request it.  
 
If you are using YuJa (particularly useful because of its stability) and/or Zoom (particularly useful for office hours and real-time engagement), have at least one short test run for you and your students as a mini-test. Please remember that if you ask TAs to help you with these tasks, those hours count as part of their contracted hours for the quarter. 

4.    Recognize that the first week of the quarter is a “warm-up” week for both the technology and your pedagogical approach. This is a great time to evaluate what is core to your course and focus on developing the capacity of our students to direct more of their learning._  
 
Remember: one of our core goals is having students develop the capacity of “learning to learn,” and you will likely discover many opportunities to have them reflect on their own processes of learning as they adapt to this new instructional mode._ 

5.    Carefully consider your assessment strategy for remote learning. This is perhaps an aspect of the course that is impacted in the most nuanced way, so a little thought before the course starts can have a large payoff in the end._ Usual assessment mechanisms (such as high-stakes testing) might be less feasible this term, so use the opportunity to experiment with other forms of evaluation. More recommendations on assessment can be found here. 

6.    Make decisions between synchronous and asynchronous modes. Both modes of instruction are valuable in a remote setting and have their advantages and disadvantages. As a minimum, for any synchronous interaction, such as Zoom, it is useful to record and to allow students to interact with it later. Also, carefully consider impacts on synchronous interactions combined with potential technical glitches and time zones on assessment._ 

7.    Leverage the research on remote teaching. Once you have established the core elements of your course, some additional considerations include: (1) students often need additional support, investment, and scaffolding to move toward successful online learning that reflects self-directed philosophies; and (2) without proper scaffolding, learners may not be equally predisposed to engage in online learning that requires high levels of self-direction. There are many resources available to address these and other questions at http://digitallearning.dtei.uci.edu/ and https://www.olrc.us/. 

8.    Staff appropriately. Faculty are ultimately responsible for the delivery of courses and grades. Courses may have additional resources available to faculty in the form of TAs and Readers. These resources should be carefully considered, and if needed, submit requests to your Dean/Assistant Dean. These can include an increase in the appointment percentages of existing TAs and Readers, or request additional TAs or Readers. ASE appointments over 50% should be submitted via the normal approval channel and is subject to review and approval by the Graduate Division. Undergraduate Learning Assistants are also an option, updated information will be posted here.  

For many of these items, we have developed resources with more details. In particular, if you are looking for the minimal guide to start remote teaching, please go here, and you can also watch this 15 minutes “getting started” video. I do not want to minimize the challenges many of you face translating a face-to-face experience with a rich history of success to the remote world. I am confident that together, UCI can be a model to other universities in this effort. "
19-Mar-20,461,Irvine,"Dear Parents and Students, 

I am writing to you to provide context as UCI moves to a quarter of remote teaching. Perhaps it will be helpful to clarify what remote teaching is, and at the same time, emphasize that it still will involve all the aspects of a traditional education: faculty and graduate student participation, opportunities for interaction (now in an online setting), and high-quality learning environments. The core of any course experience at a top, public research university are the interactions among the faculty and students, students with each other, and students with the material. The main difference between traditional courses and remote teaching is that the primary mode of these interactions moves from the physical classroom to the virtual classroom. Faculty members are still driving the design and the delivery of the experience and regularly interacting with the students. Students still engage with each other and the material. 

Learning to connect with each other in meaningful ways through technology is a skill that will serve our students well in their future careers and lives. We will always need face-to-face teaching — teaching where we are all in the same room, learning together — just as the live play was never replaced by the movie, and going to the movies has not been replaced by watching television at home. However, it is important to understand that these are unusual and challenging times that present a unique opportunity to connect, understand, and learn in novel ways. 

At this challenging moment, UCI is well positioned to support our students and faculty in this abrupt transition to remote learning for all courses during the spring quarter. Every year, we teach over 100 courses fully online with high standards and expectations of faculty and student engagement. Many and, in fact, most of our faculty have already infused technology into their classrooms and used it to enhance their face-to-face courses (see here for examples). We also have some of the top researchers in the area of remote learning (see here for examples). Their work into maximizing student success through technology is being deployed to support faculty in this transition. 

We understand that these are stressful times and that there is much uncertainty in all of our lives at present. Further, as with anything involving technology, we know that not everything in a given course will work perfectly the first time. And, even these moments will be opportunities for learning. Still, when it comes to remote instruction at UCI, we are confident in the creativity and patience of our faculty and of our students to navigate this new space and reach the same high standards of learning we expect of all Anteaters."
19-Mar-20,340,Irvine,"UCI Blood Donor Center Donation Request

19-Mar-20,448,Irvine,"Dear Friends of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts,

As the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve, we want to keep you, our valued supporters and community members, updated on how the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (CTSA) in collaboration with the greater UCI community are responding. We are working diligently to quickly adapt to the rapidly developing circumstances in order to protect our students, staff, faculty, patrons, and the world-class academic and creative work we do at CTSA.

Below are some courses of action we are currently implementing;

All CTSA courses will be taught online for the spring quarter; including studio, laboratory, seminar, and larger classes.
All performances, exhibitions, and events have been postponed, canceled, or will be reimagined in virtual ways.
All CTSA staff and faculty are working remotely, for the next few weeks or until further notice.
Even though our efforts are temporarily shifting to a remote and digital platform, our community of students, faculty, and staff will remain active and busy. These drastic times call for creative measures!

Our faculty are developing creative new ways to approach their courses online and keep our students connected.
Faculty and students have formed virtual forums to maintain the momentum and connectivity that they have formed with peers.
Staff is focused on providing essential student support in accordance with safety measures as well as continuing to award fellowships, scholarships, and financial aid opportunities.
As we adjust to this temporary mode of operation, we will be ramping up our efforts to creatively engage, communicate, and connect with our students, faculty, and community.

The UCIArtsAnywhere Campaign

This week we launched UCIArtsAnywhere, a social media campaign responding to COVID-19. The campaign's goal is to keep our UCI Arts community connected and to share the ongoing creative and academic work happening at CTSA. With#UCIArtsAnywhere, the aim is to acknowledge the disruption to normal campus life COVID-19 has brought, while also tapping into the spirit CTSA will bring to remote learning this spring. We hope you will join us in supporting the sense of communityUCIArtsAnywhere will create while we are all practicing social distancing for the health and safety of the campus and the broader community.

CTSA's mission remains firm: to inspire, to inform, to uplift, and to provide impactful experiences through our many creative outlets. Supporting our students is of utmost importance now -- more than ever. We are so deeply grateful to our new and continuing supporters and to the community, especially right now. As always, thank you for your dedication to CTSA. We hope you will enjoy and support the UCIArtsAnywhere Campaign and look forward to staying connected with you in the days ahead."

20-Mar-20,256,Irvine,"Yesterday, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order, starting at 11:59 p.m. and remaining in effect until further notice, in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19.
The Governor’s order exempts employees performing essential jobs in public agencies such as UCI. Many of you, however, already have approved work-from-home or telecommuting arrangements, as we have already taken steps to move to remote instruction and services. You should continue to work as scheduled, unless you are sick.

Some services are considered absolutely essential under the Governor’s order and require on-site support: Hospital and health care, safety and emergency, critical research and faculty, animal care, IT and building systems, as well as minimized housing, dining and custodial for those who are unable to shelter in permanent residences. Employees in these areas, as well as others determined by leadership, may need to come to their regular work locations, as instructed by their supervisors. Specific details are forthcoming if you are required on-site.

All other functions will be conducted remotely. Events and gatherings of all sizes have been canceled.

I hope this message finds you and your family safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of our top priorities has been, and will always be, the health and welfare of our community.

Thank you all for your patience as we work to navigate through this unprecedented challenge. I am confident that our Anteater family will meet this head-on and come out stronger together. Our student-athletes, coaches, and staff thrive in the face of adversity and are the most resilient group of people I have ever had the pleasure of working alongside.

Undoubtedly, this has been a difficult, anxious, and unusual time, but I am optimistic that the best of human nature will rise within us to meet the challenge. With all the tragic things happening in the world as a result of the Coronavirus, it is more important than ever to talk about being positive. Positivity, after all, is the core ingredient in the recipe for successfully navigating through a crisis.

I recently sent a note encouraging our student-athletes, coaches, and staff to remain engaged and to support one another in this time of trouble, as strengthening connections within our community will greatly help us all. We must remain proactive, taking care of our mental, physical and emotional health. And we must reach out if help is needed. It is important that we encourage and uplift one another through the display of Positive Energy, Positive Mind, and Positive Life. We call upon the entire Anteater family to do the same.

While we're focused on the health and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches, and staff, we want to continue to support our greater community in any way we can. To this end, I have been signing our internal emails with #ZotOn in the spirit of solidarity, to remind each and every one of us that we are in this together. Additionally, the Athletics department has launched a #ZotOn community resource page that will include weekly challenges, kids' activities, digital conferencing wallpapers, and other resources, including ways you can get involved.

20-Mar-20,221,Irvine,"Message Regarding UCPath Center Support
To ensure the health and safety of UCPath employees, the UCPath leadership team has made the decision to shift all UCPath Center Riverside employees to remote work effective March 20, 2020.

As the UCPath Center shifts to remote work, UCPath Center phone service will be unavailable.

The fastest way for UCI employees to get support is by creating a ticket through UCPath Online using “Ask UCPath Center.” 


Anyone who does not have internet capability to create a ticket may reach out to their division point of contact or the EEC to assist in submitting an inquiry.

The UCI Employee Experience Center (EEC) continues to provide support to UCI employees and transactors through 949.824.0500 and eec.hr.uci.edu.

Although UCPC is temporarily modifying their services, the highest priority is to ensure uninterrupted payroll, benefits and other critical services for the UC community.

As a reminder, today, 3/20, is the due date for Campus bi-weekly employees to submit timesheets and supervisors are to approve them by Monday, 3/23 at 10am.  Medical Center personnel using API must complete time entry by 3/21 at midnight and supervisors are to approve by 3/23 at noon. This is important for accurate paychecks. 

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances."
20-Mar-20,1475,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues,

In my March 17, 2020 message to UCI’s research community, I informed you of the need to ramp down and curtail UCI’s research activities.  Now, with Governor Newsom’s Executive Order N-33-20 (EO), all individuals living in the State of California are required to stay home or at their place of residence until further notice “to preserve the public health and safety, and to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and prioritizing those at the highest risk and vulnerability…”

The EO also clarifies that people may leave their homes or places of residence to report to work for an essential job. Conducting critical research is an essential job.

Because the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students is UCI’s top priority, I am writing clarify what the EO means for UCI’s research enterprise, and to update and expand upon the information contained in my March 17 message.  Above all, and to be abundantly clear, the expectation of UCI’s leadership is that everyone in the research community consistently follow the below guidelines.

Non-Critical Research
The following applies to all non-critical research carried out on the Irvine or Orange campuses, or at facilities at other locations that are owned, leased, rented or accessed by UCI:

Research activities that cannot be carried out at home must be halted by 11:59 pm today.
Research activities that can be carried out at home (with or without telecommuting) should continue to the greatest extent possible.
When carrying out non-critical research at home, each team member must work from their own home/residence.  All communications between team members must be conducted by phone or other electronic means.
Computers, storage devices, lab notebooks and papers may be removed from laboratories to facilitate working from home.
Office supplies used in the course of research may be taken home only for the purpose of conducting UCI research and business.
Under no circumstances should specimens, animals, research supplies (other than office supplies used in the course of research), equipment, instruments, etc. be removed from laboratories without the prior approval of the cognizant dean or research unit director (as applicable) and the Vice Chancellor for Research (or designee).
Designate a primary and backup emergency contact for each research group.  With prior approval of the PI or Lead Research, these individuals may access the group’s research space periodically, but not frequently, to check on the status of the lab/space and equipment, as well as troubleshoot any problems reported by research group members (e.g., rebooting computers, etc.).  While doing so, they should exceed the social distancing guidelines and clean high-touch surfaces to the extent possible.  Emergency contacts must not conduct non-critical research in the research space while the EO is in effect.
Ensure that up-to-date emergency contact information for each research space is posted on all doors leading to the space.
Critical Research
A detailed definition of critical research can be found on the Critical Research definition page on the Research Continuity website. The following applies to all critical research carried out on the Irvine or Orange campuses, or at facilities at other locations that are owned, leased, rented or accessed by UCI:

To conduct critical research during EO effective period, Principal Investigators (PIs) and Lead Researchers (LRs) must obtain approval for critical research from their cognizant dean or research unit director.  Deans and Directors are setting up review processes for such approvals. We expect very few exceptions will be granted.
Critical research activities must be conducted in a manner to ensure that the human physical distance between employees exceeds the social distancing guidelines. 
Human Subjects Research
Non-critical human subject research activities that cannot be carried out with both the researcher in their own home and the subject in their own home must be halted by 11:59 pm today.  Human research that is non-critical and can be carried out from home must comply with the requirements noted in the Non-Critical Research section above.

The general guidance posted on the Research Continuity website under the Human Research Protections section remains current for critical research, but is subject to change as circumstances evolve, so please check back frequently.

Domestic and International Field Research and Research at Sea
Research activities currently being carried out in the field must be halted unless the research team can ensure that the human physical distance between team members will consistently exceed the social distancing guidelines.  In the case that research is halted, the PI is responsible for ensuring social distancing is practiced to the maximum extent practicable when traveling back to UCI.

Research activities currently being carried out at sea should continue for the duration of the voyage, but the PI is responsible for ensuring that the research team members practice social distancing to the maximum extent practicable.  To the extent applicable, researchers returning from sea must also observe CDC travel guidelines.

Field research and research at sea that has not yet commenced must be postponed until further notice.

Students and Postdocs
Faculty and PIs/LRs are encouraged to work creatively with students to ensure they can remain on track for graduation despite disruption to research activities.
Undergraduate student, graduate students and postdocs are not and cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel.
Students or postdocs have the right to refuse to conduct critical research.
Students and postdocs should follow the guidelines established by their department, school and UCI leadership regarding whether they should remain on campus or stay at home.
Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist
The Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist should be used to prepare for halting non-critical research and preparing to minimizing activities associated with critical research.

Research Personnel Health and Safety
PIs and Lead Researchers (LR) must require that all research personnel work from home if feasible.  They are also responsible for ensuring that all essential personnel under their direction follow the social distancing guidelines.  For critical research, PIs and LRs are responsible for reducing the density of people working in their research space.

Any researcher (regardless of their position or rank) must not come to work if they are sick.  This includes essential personnel, which is why redundancy in all aspects of preparedness planning (and especially in communication plans) is vitally important.  Be sure to establish a system by which research team members can and will check the status of each other.  We must look after not only our physical health, but also consider mental health and the impact that a pandemic event can have on our most valuable asset – the immensely creative and dedicated people that make up UCI’s research community.

COVID-19 Related Expenses
To the extent your lab incurs COVID-19 related expenses, please ensure that your lab staff requests funding for and codes those expenses as indicated by DFA: https://www.budgetoffice.uci.edu/covid-19-funding-request/index.php.

Our school, our university, our nation and our globe will weather the pandemic, and it is within our power as biologists to create a better future. In fact, as life sciences experts, we are the people who are uniquely capable of doing so. Each of us must understand this, embrace it, and commit to stepping up and doing our part.

What BioSci is Doing Right Now About COVID-19

To most people in the general public, the coronavirus seems to have come out of nowhere. They perceive it as an unknown enemy, which makes its spread especially terrifying. But as biologists, we already know a great deal about coronaviruses and lately about COVID-19. 
 
Experts throughout BioSci are conducting critical COVID-19 research. Our top virologists are working with a national consortium of leading scientists evaluating whether antibodies neutralizing viruses that are extracted from the blood of recovered COVID-19 patients can serve as an emergency treatment for the disease. They are also collaborating on cloning key elements of the COVID-19, SARS and MERS coronavirus strains to study how our bodies recognize and attack these viruses. Other BioSci researchers are investigating COVID-19’s impact on the nervous system.

COVID-19 Will Be Vanquished

We know that coronavirus can and will be vanquished, and it will happen due to the fundamental work of biologists. Without the essential scientific knowledge we produce, vaccinations, therapeutics and cures for this virus and all other biological hazards, would be impossible. The information we uncover during this pandemic will help us overcome and even prevent the next one.

Life Interconnected

What we are experiencing demonstrates that mind, body and world health is interconnected. As environmental threats rise unchecked, the wellbeing of our globe and all who inhabit it suffers. What we are seeing with this coronavirus foreshadows what is to come; unless we all commit to doing everything we can to change the future. And we can change it. How do we change it? As individuals, as the School of Biological Sciences and as a society as a whole, we must embrace and support the leading role of biology in shaping the future.

How You Will Change the Future

To our students, I say you will do so through your continued commitment to your education here. To our faculty and researchers, please continue to conduct the world-class education and scientific inquiry that advances discovery, remotely for the time being. Alumni, please keep using the knowledge you’ve gained here to perform crucial work in the life sciences, and to advocate for biology on a broader basis. To our donors, I emphasize that we need your crucial support and resources to advance our mission and to recruit more advocates to this very crucial cause. Our nation and our world desperately require what each of you can personally do.

Listen to the Clarion Call

This pandemic is a clarion call for greater investment in and commitment to biologists and biological research. I am, and all of us should be, extremely proud of the work we do. We should know as biology students, biology teachers, family members and donors that the challenges we are facing today can and will be overcome. It will take fundamental research, hard work and dedication, but we at UCI BioSci serve a crucial, critical role in achieving this goal. I call upon each of you to step up and proudly work as a team to make our world a better place. I will be proudly working alongside you. "
21-Mar-20,387,Irvine,"Dear UCI Community:

Last night, we were informed that a non-student resident of UCI’s campus family housing tested positive for COVID-19. The individual returned from an international trip with symptoms and has been resting comfortably in good condition.

In accordance of health privacy laws, we cannot disclose the identity or personal information regarding the individual. We have coordinated with the Orange County Health Care Agency and been in touch with those who may have been exposed through contact.

The risk to the general campus population remains low. As testing becomes more available in the coming weeks, it is likely that we will become aware of additional positive cases within the UCI community. In addition to directly notifying anyone who may be exposed through contact, moving forward, we will notify the campus community through the COVID-19 Latest Updates emails and as aggregate information at UCI’s Coronavirus Information Hub. 

As we begin spring break, we remain diligent in our efforts to keep our community safe. Remote learning for Spring quarter is underway and large gatherings have been canceled. Our social-distancing efforts will help our community “flatten the curve” and deploy vital health care resources to those who need it most.

This situation, both locally and globally, continues to evolve. Please refer to our Coronavirus website for important information and updates. You may also contact our Coronavirus Response Center at 949-824-9918 (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m.) or covid19@uci.edu if you have any questions or comments.

We understand that the uncertainty and seriousness of this pandemic may cause distress and anxiety for many of us. Assistance is available for those who need it. For students, our counseling center continues to provide services remotely; faculty and staff may use the services of our employee assistance program.

It’s important that we remain diligent in preventing the spread of the virus. Please remember to wash your hands well, cover your mouth with your elbow, stay home if you’re sick, and disinfect surfaces, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We will continue to keep our community updated as new developments occur. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and your loved ones. Your health and security are our primary concern."
21-Mar-20,423,Irvine,"Dear alumni, donors and friends,

First and foremost, our thoughts are with you and our global community during this unprecedented time. The safety and well-being of everyone, especially our Anteater family, are of the utmost importance to us. We continue to closely monitor this evolving situation, and because it is changing at such a rapid pace, we have established a new website, which is serving as a gathering place for accurate and timely information about events and conditions on campus. Please visit often for the latest information.

To ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff on campus, the university has taken immediate action. All campus instruction is now done remotely; as many staff as possible are now telecommuting to work; many buildings and facilities, including residential facilities on campus, are closing; all events, including our Anteater sports teams, have been canceled or postponed; and we are retaining only limited on-site operations for critical functions.

You can find a list of all impacted alumni and university advancement events here, which will continue to be updated. If you have registered for an upcoming event, you will be contacted directly with more information.

UCI remains dedicated to your health and lifelong well-being in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the day this virus was first recognized, UCI Health researchers and medical experts have worked closely with other hospitals and healthcare providers – regionally and across the nation – sharing best practices while staying current with the latest information, treatments and tools.

A team of UCI researchers is already working on a COVID-19 therapeutic drug study. Backed by the National Institutes of Health, this clinical trial is considered the first that has possible efficacy and should be ready for patients soon. Other university work is underway to develop tests, treatments and vaccines to help us identify, contain and prevent pandemics.

Many have asked, “How can I support UCI?” as we navigate this uncertain time. The best way is to support the UCI Emergency Response Fund, which provides the university with the flexibility to respond to the most pressing and emerging needs.

We are continually moved and inspired by how quickly the UCI community comes together. As we work to meet the needs of our campus and global community, we send our thoughts to all those impacted by the virus. Thank you for your commitment to UCI, and for your patience and understanding as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances."
22-Mar-20,282,Irvine,"Dear campus community,

As many of you know, UCI is home for many Anteaters. As a community, we are facing challenging circumstances as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to support those who are staying on campus because the safety of our community remains our primary concern. Security patrols are being performed on a routine basis.

Because campus operations have transitioned to remote instruction and telecommuting for many business functions, several UCI buildings have been closed until further notice. This does not mean that critical services and work have stopped. Departments and organizations will continue to carry out approved critical functions while maintaining social distancing guidelines. Those authorized to continue supporting our critical functions will continue to have access to applicable campus buildings.

A current list of closed buildings is posted on UCI’s COVID-19 website and will be routinely updated. We are currently working with Office of Research, Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, student services, building managers, and other campus leadership to develop clear guidance to access certain buildings to retrieve necessary paperwork, teach remote classes, and check on critical infrastructure. This information will be shared soon.

Enhanced custodial services continue for open buildings. 

If you have immediate concerns about building access, please contact your supervisor, building facilities manager, or send an email to the Chancellor’s Executive Policy Group at cepg-center@uci.edu or the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response Center at covid19@uci.edu.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through these unprecedented times. Please continue to take good care of yourselves and support one another."
23-Mar-20,144,Irvine,"Dear Instructors,

As we move into spring break and preparation for spring quarter, I recognize that there have been numerous communications over the last few weeks and that the landscape has also changed significantly over this period. If you would like easy access to previous emails, we have archived them on the main UCI COVID-19 site:

uci.edu/coronavirus


A few messages that may be particularly relevant include:

March 19: Update on Remote Teaching for Parents and Students

March 19: Remote Teaching Information (This focuses on undergraduate teaching. Though many of the suggestions can be applicable to graduate courses as well, please check with your Department for any graduate specific policy or procedural differences.)

March 11: Copyright information

Thank you again for all your efforts on behalf of our students."
23-Mar-20,850,Irvine,"Dear UCI Post-Docs:

I am truly sorry that your first day of Spring Break began with an announcement of a COVID-19 positive case on our campus. Many of you remain in Irvine, in graduate family housing, as we all seek to play our own best role in this global battle to lessen and eventually eliminate the threat of the coronavirus pandemic;

As you know, this morning UCI announced that a case of COVID-19 has been confirmed among the UCI community. In line with University policy and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Orange County Health Care Agency, the affected individual is self-isolating off campus. Students, faculty, and staff who may have had direct contact with the individual are being notified and will be asked to self-isolate. If you were identified as someone who has been in contact with, or in close proximity to, any individual who has tested positive for the virus, you will be notified. If you were not identified as such, your risk is no different than it was yesterday, and you should continue to follow the same best practices and recommendations. 

Your safety and well-being are my utmost concern. Campus authorities are closely monitoring and evaluating this unfolding situation. 

I wish I could tell you when we can expect things to return to normal. Sadly, no one can. What I will commit to you is that I will tell you whatever I can, regularly, while being as transparent as possible.

We will open labs and studios, return to in-person courses, reignite our exciting array of in-person intensives, workshops, performances, and more as soon as we are safely able.

In accordance with health privacy laws, we cannot disclose the identity or personal information regarding the individual nor which housing community is theirs. If you are aware of their identity, please respect their privacy so they can focus on their health and recovery. Until widespread testing can be achieved, it is still best to assume that everyone has been exposed, including you, even if you have no symptoms. A confirmed case on our campus does not change those recommendations.

We remain diligent in our efforts to keep our community safe. Campus residence and dining halls, as well as health services, remain open for students who stay during the break and/or from the start of the spring quarter. We are working to ensure that students who need funding assistance with items related to COVID-19 are able to request special funding from the University wherever possible. For example, AGS has special travel grants for those seeking to leave campus, and TAs who need additional technology to support emergency distance learning can request it through their departments. We will continue in our efforts to marshal additional resources and share those when we are able.

Our social-distancing efforts will help our community “flatten the curve” and deploy vital health care resources to those who need it most. This situation, both locally and globally, continues to evolve.  Please refer to our Coronavirus website for important information and updates.  You may also contact our Coronavirus Response Center at 949-824-9918 or covid19@uci.edu if you have any questions or comments.

I am awe-struck by the incredible stories of kindness and resiliency I continue to hear from our community. I’ve been incredibly impressed by the number of staff from Graduate Division who have been volunteering to help at the Fresh Needs Hub or to donate blood. I’ve been amazed at the number of student workers volunteering to help out with UCI’s clinical needs. Earlier in the week, I was told about an entire research team who had lost access to several field sites at K-12 schools and were able to rapidly turn their project into one focused on distance learning. Yesterday, I had a PhD student tell me that this crisis has reaffirmed her resolve to succeed, and she has been making more progress on her writing than ever before. I’ve also heard tales from my colleagues at other universities of butchering their first emergency distance learning class, only to have the undergraduate students and grad TAs help them recover, with everyone learning a lot in the process.

There is no doubt that many of us are suffering. We will not know the full extent for some time. I am, and remain always, an optimist. Stay safe, wash your hands, and be kind to yourself and each other. We will get through this together. Should you want to talk, reach out to UCI Counseling Services, who can offer telehealth services, as well as the Graduate Division counselors, Elizabeth Dunn (dunnes@uci.edu) and Phong Luong (pbluong@uci.edu). Reach out to each other—virtually or at a distance—and talk through what you are experiencing. We need to you to stay physically isolated right now, but please know that you are not alone. 

I look forward to seeing you as soon as I can. In the meantime, be safe, be kind, and be well."
23-Mar-20,519,Irvine,"On Saturday, we shared with you news that a health care worker had tested positive for COVID-19. This person was masked and wearing appropriate PPE during the onset of mild symptoms. Please keep the following in mind:

The infection was community acquired and everyone who was in contact with this person has been notified is being monitored.
Exposure doesn’t mean you should stop working; Occupational Health and EIP have posted guidelines. View FAQs and guidelines here
Drive-up Testing Sites
Our ambulatory team has done a wonderful job getting two drive-up testing sites up and running last week. The site at 200 Manchester was ready to see UCI Health patients last Tuesday, having it operational in just a few days. The site at Gottschalk Medical Plaza began swabbing patients on Friday. This effort not only adds convenience for our patients, it relieves the demand on the Pav 3 clinic. Congratulations and a heartfelt thank you to all involved!

UCI Health Staff Treat Carts
Over the weekend, the Culinary and Nutrition and Patient Experience Guest Services teams launched a program to deliver treat care packages to UCI Health care teams. The entire UCI Health leadership team applauds their initiative to recognize colleagues’ hard work and dedication to patients during these challenging times. Though they weren’t able to reach every unit, their efforts will continue this week.

UCI Blood Donor Center Donation Request
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the UCI Blood Donor Center hard and has stretched supplies available for our trauma program. If you are feeling well and healthy, please consider donating blood. Visit the UCI Blood Donor Center website to schedule a blood or platelet donation at the Medical Center site. Donations may be scheduled via telephone at 714-456-5733, or at the website

Offers of PPE
UCI Health has received several kind offers of PPE from members of our community. As inquiries role in, we will assess our needs and whether the materials are compliant. The current protocol for reviewing PPE offers are as follows: 

PPE or other supply offers will be forwarded to the attention of the UCI Health Supply Chain, Maurra Baruch at mbaruch@hs.uci.edu or 714-456-3863. 
In collaboration with UCOP, who are validating and planning to coordinate resources system wide, our supply chain team will evaluate our needs and assess compliance.
If offers involve donors, that information will be shared with our advancement team to manage those relationships.

23-Mar-20,1302,Irvine,"Hello Grad Students and Post-Docs,

For those of you having a much needed rest on this first day of Spring Break, enjoy it! It can be hard to feel anything but guilt and anxiety when so many around us are losing jobs, falling ill, or coping with seemingly impossible situations. It’s okay to relax for a minute and not worry. Put on your own mask first, as they say on the airplane. You will be up and ready again soon enough.

For those of you not resting, perhaps because you are madly writing a paper or studying for your comprehensive exams, or perhaps because you are home-schooling children, or perhaps because you are working in healthcare, you’ve got this! You are strong and excellent and incredible or you would not be in the position you are.

Now, for a few small updates from campus and answers to questions we have gotten:

UCI Libraries Remote Resources:
Did you forget to return that library book? I know in my house we did, and my second grader is racking up some pretty hefty fines. The good news is that just like his elementary school, UCI understands these are not normal times. Please check out the library’s website for additional information on remote resources: https://www.lib.uci.edu/remote-resources

In the middle of the page is a section that will answer many questions--called ""Managing Your Library Account"" and ""Returning Materials"":

Our book drops are open at Langson and Science Libraries.
If an item is due and you are unable to renew it and do not want to come to campus to return it (due to illness or other extenuating circumstances), you should keep it until you are able to safely return it. If you are charged late fees, please email us at circadm@uci.edu. We understand that this is a special situation, and special considerations will be made.
Books can also be returned by mail at:
UC Irvine Libraries, Attn: John Bareford,
P.O. Box 19557
Irvine CA 92623
If you do return your items it will not be reflected in your library account until staff are able to return onsite.
Reminder about Health Services:

Student Health is up and running for those of you on or near the Irvine campus. From their website:

Effective 3-9-2020 followed by additional guidance received 3-16-2020, UC SHIP will reduce the student cost share to $0 for all medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with directives recently issued by the CA Department of Managed Care and the CA Department of Insurance. Cost sharing includes, but is not limited to, copays, deductibles or coinsurance. Medically necessary screening, testing and treatment for COVID-19 may include hospital services (including emergency department), urgent care visits, provider office visits, telehealth encounters (e.g., LiveHealth Online) and clinical labs where the purpose of the visit is to be screened, tested and/or treated for COVID-19.

If you have GSHIP and are not on or near the Irvine campus, please check out the information on GSHIP online. Most notable:

When you are traveling away from home and/or campus, you have access to care across the country through Anthem’s BlueCard® PPO Program. If you’re traveling outside the U.S., you have access to care through the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program. For assistance, please visit Anthem Blue Cross or contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center at (800) 810-2583 (BLUE).

Housing:

So far, it appears that only a small number of students currently living in grad and family housing have requested to move out. For the rest of you, please remember to use proper social distancing procedures and to obey the Governor’s Stay at Home order. This means, in short, other than your household, you should really not be interacting with other people in person. This doesn’t mean you can’t go outside. It does mean when you go outside, you should be a MINIMUM of 6ft apart from people who do not live in your home. 

Requests for Additional Support:

We are examining requests systemwide for additional financial support as well as waivers, changes to degree requirements, changes to time to degree, and so on. There are no easy answers to these questions, and most challenging is that none of us can predict the future. We wouldn’t want to approve a one quarter extension or waiver only to learn that the impacts require something much longer nor make major changes only to find there is a cure next week (we can hope!). So, please be patient, and know that we are watching all of these things. We are only one week into our Stay at Home process, and we simply don’t know what we don’t know yet.

And Now the Good News:

UCI is one of many places currently conducting clinical trials on drugs that can treat COVID-19. I am incredibly proud and honored to know that some of your research will go towards ending this epidemic. Some of you are creating beautiful art that responds to our current crisis. Others of you are studying impacts of social distancing on children, on society, and on vulnerable populations, such as those coping with domestic violence or in need of clean water. PhD students in Education are on the forefront of studying remote learning, especially for people with chronic illness or disabilities, that can now be leveraged to lessen impacts for our families and other scholars in Education are asking important questions about the very nature of the university experience. PhD students in Social Ecology and Social Sciences are on the forefront of understanding the particular adverse impacts of this crisis on the homeless or on our elections, and of course our graduate students in Public and Population Health are the next generation of practitioners and scholars to address this and any future public health crises. Our virologists are working towards creating vaccines for this and other diseases. Never before has the need for and importance of academic scholarship been more clear. 

Let us all hope for a brighter week this week than last.

Be well and stay safe as we all adjust to this “new way of living”!"
23-Mar-20,195,Irvine,"Dear colleagues:

In an effort to assist our essential employees who are required to work on-site during this unique and unprecedented period of time, UCI is partnering with the YMCA to offer local child care services.

Two locations will be offered: Doubletree Hotel in Orange and Student Center on the UCI campus
Services will be offered for children ages five through 12
Hours are planned for 6:00 a.m. – 8:00 p.m.
Depending on the needs of employees, infant, overnight, weekend and evening care may be considered. Please complete the survey so that we may accurately assess all needs.
If you are interested, please complete the survey found at this link:https://ucichildcare.questionpro.com/

If you are an employee that is not required to be working on-site, but you may need child care services to assist during telecommuting, please complete the survey and our team will do our best to help facilitate your needs."
25-Mar-20,426,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues,

We are gratified and uplifted by the enormous interest on the part of the campus community to reallocate/repurpose needed equipment to the UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) as they respond to the COVID-19 crisis. In an effort to coordinate internal reallocation/repurposing of these items and assist UCIMC with their urgent need for personal protective equipment (PPE), Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) will be the point of contact for the campus. 

The items that UCIMC will accept are the following:

Face shields
Goggles
General face masks
Gloves
N95 respirators
Isolation gowns (disposable)
Hand sanitizer (manufacturer made, not compoents)
UCIMC has indicated that they cannot accept any separate components to make hand sanitizer due to DOT regulations and nosocomial swabs because they must be a certain type for medical use.  Please do not bring any items that are not listed above due to space constraints.

Prior to drop-off, in order to ensure safe receipt and delivery of PPE, please read these instructions carefully:
Before delivery, please fill out an intake form, then print and bring with you the email acknowledgment of your submission (A link to this form will also be available on UCI’s Coronavirus Information Hub website).  This form will assist EH&S in organizing the incoming items and ensure the items are distributed to UCIMC and to any other campus units that are most in need.  Please keep good records of reallocated items for reconciliation later, in particular those charged to federal funds.  EH&S is not able to return any unused items so please remember to keep PPE in stock for your own research needs.  Please note: This is not a charitable donation. Charitable donations are being handled separately by UCI Advancement."
25-Mar-20,510,Irvine,"Dear Faculty, 

As we prepare for remote instruction for Spring quarter and you spend more time with UCI’s learning management system (LMS), with Canvas and with Zoom, I write to offer the following: 

1.      We have prepared this script for you to announce at the beginning of class meetings: 

“This [class meeting/discussion group/etc.] is being conducted over Zoom.  As the instructor, I will be recording this session.  I have disabled the recording feature for others so that no one else will be able to record this session.  I will be posting this session to the course’s website at [LMS/Canvas location].  If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in the recording, you may turn video off (click “stop video”) so that Zoom does not record you.  If, when you disable live video, you also want to use a profile image (other than a picture of you) instead of your name, please let me know which image you will be using so that I know who you are during the session.  If you would like to ask a question, you may do so privately through the Zoom chat by addressing your chat question to me only (and not to “everyone”), or you may contact me by another private method.  If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact me.” 

2.      You can protect the privacy of your students and enable students with disabilities to absorb each session by taking the following steps: 

A.    Record your sessions in Zoom (after modifying your settings as described below), record the session locally, and upload the recording into YuJa for embedded distribution with YuJa Media Chooser.  This will: (i) make it very difficult for someone to grab the link and share/download the session and (ii) allow you to modify the settings in your Zoom profile settings. 

B.     Modify settings as follows in your Zoom profile: 

·         Settings/meeting: turn OFF “auto saving chats” 

·         Settings/meeting: turn ON “allow host to type closed captions or assign a participant/third party device to add closed captions” 

·         Settings/recording: turn OFF “local recording: allow hosts and participants to record the meeting to a local file” 

·         Settings/recording: turn ON “cloud recording: allow hosts to record and save the meeting in the cloud” 

3.      I encourage you to provide your remote instruction via UCI’s LMS/Canvas.  Although it is not perfect (and we are working to improve it), it provides you with the best protection related to copyright issues in two ways: (a) you have more protection from claims that you have infringed someone else’s copyrights when you use another’s work in your materials if your course is delivered via LMS/Canvas, and (b) the technology of LMS/Canvas makes it more difficult for anyone to copy and distribute your materials. "
25-Mar-20,361,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues, 

We are living through unprecedented times. For most of us, this paradigm of living, learning, teaching and serving may change the way we navigate the future. This COVID-19 pandemic gets to the core why many of us have chosen a profession in healthcare and research.

Every person receiving this email has the power to help improve the health and well-being of our community.  You, me, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends, we are all in this together. Many of us have even chosen to serve as pharmacists, scientists, and healthcare providers because of our desire to serve the greater good and make positive change in this world. 

Today, I write to inform you of some of the ways the Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy Practice along with UCI Health pharmacists are combating COVID-19. 

COVID-19 Testing & Research
UCI faculty and scientists are rising to the challenge of protecting communities across Orange County during this difficult time. As Orange County's only academic health system, UCI Health and UCI Medical Center are well-equipped to manage the care of patients with infectious diseases.

In the lab, we are working on creating tools for expedient testing and blocking the SARS CoV-2 virus. Many of our world-class faculty members are experts on the development of diagnostic methods and on RNA, which makes up the CoV-2’s genome.

In the clinic, our UCI pharmacists are working alongside other healthcare providers to develop COVID-19 treatment protocols to best serve our communities. 
 
Campus & Community Updates 
As you may know, UCI has suspended in-person courses, events, and non-essential research. The Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy Practice have taken advantage of our small but growing size to rapidly respond to the challenge of offering a virtual academic environment for our students. Additionally, UCI has created a comprehensive website for coronavirus updates for the UCI community: https://uci.edu/coronavirus

Lastly, I encourage you to use methods that will help us all continue to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our brilliant future will continue to happen together. Please practice social distancing, wash your hands, and don't forget to Zot, Zot, Zot! "
25-Mar-20,421,Irvine,"Dear Anteaters:

These are very difficult times and not having the right equipment to access your coursework can make them even more difficult. To help alleviate the challenge of securing appropriate computer equipment for remote learning, UCI has secured a number of laptops for free loan during Spring quarter to students who don’t have access to key remote learning tools.

In particular, students who don’t have access to the following computer equipment, which is required to run Zoom (for web conferencing) and Respondus Monitor + LockDown Browser (for online test proctoring), might benefit from borrowing a laptop:

=         -Windows or Mac OS X operating systems (Google Chromebooks, iPads, iPhones, and Android tablets and phones do not support Respondus)

25-Mar-20,1397,Irvine,"Hello Grad Students and Post-Docs,

 

I hope you are getting a chance to enjoy your spring break as much as you can. Here are a few reminders and updates regarding the COVID-19 virus and the adjustments Graduate Division is making.

 

Congratulations to our 2020 Grad Slam Champion: Rebecca Riley!
I want to start this message with a very heartfelt congratulations to Rebecca Riley, who was named UCI’s 2020 Grad Slam Champion last month! Rebecca is a doctoral student studying Theoretical Particle Physics. In her Grad Slam talk entitled In the Dark Corners of the Universe, Rebecca describes the mystery of dark matter and its importance to the world - all in under 3 minutes! Take a listen to her impressive talk on why dark matter...well, matters! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbekjAnvDHg&feature=youtu.be).

Unfortunately due to COVID-19 concerns, the UC Office of the President made the difficult decision to cancel the UC-systemwide 2020 Grad Slam Competition, initially scheduled to take place on May 8th in San Francisco, CA. We know Rebecca would have made us proud! 

DSC COVID-19 Update
The DSC website has been updated with accessibility tips and resources for online instruction and remote classes for faculty and students. Please visithttps://dsc.uci.edu/covid19/ for more.

In Closing
I want to close today by talking a bit about how many of us are feeling right now. I heard the news today that Cal State was on a hiring freeze only shortly before learning that the partner of someone I care about a lot got a tenure track position at a community college. I heard the news today that Brown University was on a hiring freeze only shortly after seeing a copy of a contract for a tenure track position that someone asked me to look over so she could sign it. The roller coaster of emotions is nearly crushing, and these are not my own jobs but those of people in the UCI community. I can only imagine how it must feel to be at or near the end of your academic journey as either a post-doc or grad student and looking into this job market. 

Even for those who have a few years for the economy to recover before you search for jobs, summer internships have been disrupted, partners and family members may have been laid off. This is a brutal time for so many. Some of you may feel emboldened or focused or motivated by these times of crisis. Some of you may be able to only do the bare minimum each day to keep your health, your family’s health, and your life in order. I hope you are kind and generous with yourselves. We are not even two weeks into the “stay at home” order, and we have no idea what time will bring. 

It is okay to grieve. And please know that you are grieving. I’ve said before that I am an optimist, and I remain so. We are all living through something that no living person has ever seen, and we must hope that we will never see it again.

“When the unthinkable happens, the lighthouse is hope. Once we choose hope, everything is possible.” – Christopher Reeve

I am deeply sad for the pain that so many of you are feeling. I am anxious on my own. But I also have hope. I hope that we will learn from this time. I hope that we will find a cure. I hope that we will see a vaccine soon. I hope that disruption will be minimal.

And as always, I hope to see you all in person soon!"
25-Mar-20,328,Irvine,"Dear UCI Community,

As we are all adjusting to teaching, working and learning in a virtual world due to COVID-19, OIT would like to remind students and employees of the technological services and tools available to facilitate campus business remotely. Whether you need to instruct a course, meet and collaborate with a colleague, or complete coursework remotely, OIT is committed to meeting your technology needs. Here are recently deployed tools that support our collective remote work:

Zoom: A powerful web conferencing tool is now available to all faculty, staff, and students. You can host an online gathering for instruction or meetings for up to 300 people.
Campus VPN: We’ve added capacity on the campus VPN (Virtual Private Network) to accommodate the increase in off-campus traffic. VPN allows you to access University resources, such as your work computer or UCI Libraries resources from off campus.
Virtual Computing Lab: The virtual computing lab allows students and faculty to use common research software such as Matlab, SPSS, SAS, and others in a virtual environment remotely.
Respondus Lockdown Browser + Monitor: Facilitate exams with this combination of tools that restricts computer activity and provides for automated exam session monitoring and recording.
Adobe Creative Cloud: For a limited time through May 31, Adobe has made the Creative Cloud suite available to all campus. This includes popular applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and other premium Adobe software.
Laptops for Loan: Faculty, staff, and students who do not have a computer available at home may request OIT-provided laptops to loan on a limited basis.
Keep updated on information and resources for remote work with TechPrep @ UCI and other Virtual Tools and Resources.

If you need support for any of the above services, please contact the OIT Help Desk at (949) 824-2222 or oit@uci.edu. You can also follow OIT on Twitter for tips, tools and updates on technology at UCI."
26-Mar-20,0,Irvine,
26-Mar-20,444,Irvine,"With campus access limited to essential individuals only, UCI Payment Services has temporarily modified its service offerings and procedures for payment card solutions, cashiering, and handling of deposits. Campus departments should review the information below and adjust any internal processes as needed.

Payment Card Solutions

All TouchNet Marketplace & Aventri inquiries can be emailed to Lindsay Carroll at carrolll@uci.edu or Nick Troup at troupn@uci.edu.
All inquiries regarding the use of third-party payment systems, new merchant setups, PCI-related questions or concerns should be emailed to pcsgroup@uci.edu.
The Campus Terminal Rental Program is suspended until further notice.
Central Cashiers

Central Cashiers are primarily on a remote schedule.
All in-person service windows in Aldrich Hall are closed.
UCI departments should not accept cash at this time.
Central Cashiers will process checks and deposits picked-up from the North Campus Mail Processing Center on Thursdays.
Sub-cashier deposits will be accepted only by appointment on Thursdays. Please contact Payment Services at cashiers@uci.edu.
COD System Deposits - New Processing Procedures

With most campus departments now working remotely, there is still a need to ensure deposits are delivered safely to UCI Payment Services. UCI departments receiving checks that need to be deposited should institute the cash handling procedures below for the duration of the current public health emergency.

Be Aware of Limited Campus Mail Service

Campus business offices should keep in mind that Distribution Services is running limited service during the next several weeks. No mail is being picked up or delivered to campus departments. Drop boxes and mailboxes across campus have been emptied and signage has been placed informing customers not to use them at this time. The drop slot outside the main entrance to Aldrich Hall, second floor is available, but it is a very small slot. If you have a large deposit, please send it via campus mail by dropping it off at the North Campus Mail Processing Center.

To Ensure Monies are Secure and Deposited Weekly:

UCI department staff planning to make check deposits should do the following:
Staff with a valid UCI ID may retrieve their incoming mail from the North Campus Mail Processing Center 9:30 – 10:30 a.m., Monday through Friday.
Prepare checks for deposit through Campus Online Deposit (COD). Only staff with COD approved Kuali Security Access Management System (KSAMS) access can complete this step.
Departments may drop off their outgoing mail at the North Campus Mail Processing Center from 7 – 9 a.m. for same day service. Outgoing mail delivered from 9 a.m. – 2 p.m. will be processed the following business day.
Questions? Please contact Payment Services at cashiers@uci.edu."
27-Mar-20,1396,Irvine,"Dear Grad Students and Post-Docs,

Each day since we received orders to “stay at home” from the governor have brought us each our own trials. More than 3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, and in a world without universal healthcare, this means many have lost their ability to combat this pandemic at the same time. Although all of you can get health insurance through UCI, you may have partners, friends, and others in need. If so, please remember that they can buy coverage at Covered California if they are in this state. Also, please remember if your friends or family have been laid off as part of this crisis, they can file for state unemployment as well as the additional federal coverage provided by the stimulus package. 

A big thanks to David Levinson, owner of Levinson Tax Services and current Merage MPAc student, for writing a summary of the stimulus package that even I could understand. 

Answers to Some Questions We Have Been Getting

Coursework
You may have noticed that the campus has made it possible (via the Registrar) to change between graded and not much later into the quarter than typically allowed. 

For grad classes, P/NP is not a valid option if you want it to “count.” It must be S/U (satisfactory-unsatisfactory). Don’t ask me why. It way predates me, and I honestly don’t know. Please watch for it though if you are in a course in which faculty have turned on these options. 
If you are a TA/Reader, please remember to share grade information regularly with your students so that they can make the best decision for themselves whether they want things graded.
Broad implementation of grading strategies at the graduate level continue to be in the control of the schools and programs. Some have chosen to go with a wide range of S/U courses and some have not. In some cases, these decisions are impacted by accreditation and professional certification requirements. Please check in with your grad program advisor if you have questions about this.  

Michael Dennin, Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, will be hosting a series of office hours for the next two weeks to help with the ramping up of the quarter.

These will be 4 – 5 pm on:

Monday March 30
Tuesday March 31
Thursday April 2
Tuesday April 7
Wednesday April 8
Thursday April 9

Emergency Financial Support
Some of you have reached out about rent relief and other sources of aid during this crisis. Student Affairs, Housing, and other facilities are currently being assessed for what can be done. What I have seen of their efforts is a group of people working as hard as they can as fast as they can to do the best they can by all of you while also recognizing the impacts of the massive loss of revenue from students moving out, conferences cancelling, and limits on external programs. We must balance what we do to keep both students and staff safe, keep our staff employed even without our usual operating funds, and keep essential services up and running. UCI is working with local, state, and federal authorities to access as much emergency funding as we can as well as tapping donor bases, grants, and other sources of revenue. I hope to be able to share positive results from all of these efforts soon.

Extensions
We have gotten a lot of concerned messages about attempting to advance to candidacy or meet other deadlines in Spring quarter. Faculty from individual programs and the academic senate (Graduate Council) have control of these rules. However, a few current details may help ease some of your concerns. Summer quarter counts as part of the year you are in now. So, if you are trying to advance by end of “this year,” you are good as long as you do it by the day before fall quarter (end of September). Additionally, we have waived filing fees and many other fees for Spring and Summer quarters. We have also asked faculty to be flexible and allow for major exams of this kind in the summer if at all possible. So, this should give you a decent amount of flexibility. Obviously, we will continue to watch things, and if additional extensions become necessary, Graduate Council (faculty senate) is very much ready to take up this issue. As always, Graduate Division (my team) maintains the ability to grant extensions on an individual basis should you have specific needs. 

Research Continuity

The Office of Research has provided guidance on research continuity on their website:https://news.research.uci.edu/research-continuity/

Most research falls in one of these categories:

Critical Research: Essential experiments, COVID related research, and so on. If your work is in these categories, you may continue work. You MUST use good social distancing. If your PI is not following these guidelines, you should talk with your department chair or Associate Dean for Research.
Research that can be conducted online (or from home): You can continue to analyze data, write articles and books, do close readings, etc if you can do them from home. You can also collect new data if it can be done remotely.
Research that cannot be conducted from home and is not critical: In most cases, this work has been paused.
Regardless of what category your work falls into, you may be struggling to be “productive.” You may also find respite in the work. Either response (or both!) are completely normal. Please work with your PI, thesis advisor, department chairs, DECADE mentors, and everyone else who can help you work through this time. There are no right or wrong answers unfortunately. We also have no way to predict how any of us will be feeling in another two weeks. Do the best you can and keep communication lines open. 

In Closing

Finally, I just want to close by telling you what has been the hardest part of all of this for me: PATIENCE. Be patient while we wait for a cure. Be patient while we wait for a vaccine. Be patient while you wait to see if your young son’s dry cough is going to progress, to see if you or your husband will get whatever he has. Be patient while they restock the shelves. Be patient while you wait for your sister-in-law to file for unemployment. Be patient while you wait on hold trying to get her healthcare coverage. Be patient while your students await job interviews that have to be rescheduled. Be patient with all those projects that are now delayed because the resources have had to be diverted elsewhere. Patience. Patience. Patience. The last two weeks have felt like a year. I don’t know about you, but I am running a bit low on it. And so each morning, I try to remind myself to have patience, with myself, with everyone else, with the universe. Some of the greatest minds for millennia have reminded us of the virtue of patience. Their words, repeated throughout each day, have helped me, and I hope they help you:
 

“Endurance is nobler than strength, and patience than beauty.” John Ruskin
“Patience is the key to contentment.” The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)
“Patience attracts happiness; it brings near that which is far.” Swahili Proverb
“But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.” Romans 8:25

As always, hoping to see you in person soon."
27-Mar-20,215,Irvine,"Faculty,

If you are trying to conduct remote instruction from home, it is possible you may encounter internet performance problems. We wanted provide some options to help you mitigate this potential issue:

Upgrade your broadband through your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Broadband is generally the fastest, most consistently performing option for connecting to the internet. Many ISPs are providing free broadband upgrades for faculty, when asked. Contact your ISP to request this.
Come to campus and record your lectures using UCI’s network
Campus is working on a plan to provide remote teaching classrooms for faculty who need them. More information on these classroom spaces will be coming soon.
Use your existing smartphone as a hotspot
As a last resort, you can set up your phone as a mobile hotspot and connect to it. This option is generally not as fast or reliable as broadband service, but it can work if needed. Contact your cellular phone provider and ask for a free upgrade to tethering and unlimited data, as a faculty member teaching remotely.
Contact information for internet and cellular service providers and more details can be found on the TechPrep @ UCI website under Internet Connectivity: Resources to help you get connected from off-campus."

29-Mar-20,905,Irvine,"Dear Grad Students and Post-Docs,

I hope you are getting some rest and enjoyment from this Sunday and not stressing about the quarter starting tomorrow. As a reminder, campus is encouraging instructors to use Week One of Spring quarter as a “soft open,” being lenient with deadlines, attendance, and so on. Hopefully, students will also treat instructors with grace as we all figure out this world of Emergency Distance Learning together. 

As you prepare for the start of the quarter, please note the resources and advice surrounding technology for distance collaboration, teaching, learning, and other work.

Additional Technology Resources:

As a reminder, UCI has TWO programs through which you can get access to additional technology that you might need during this time of emergency distance learning. If your need is predominantly as a student, meaning you need a laptop to TAKE classes, please use the loan program through the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning. If your need is predominantly as an employee, meaning you need a laptop to teach, grade, conduct your sponsored research, you should use the program through your hiring department. Using the correct program helps us to get the right support to the right place as quickly as possible. Any attempt to make requests that are not needed, to request from both programs at once, or to otherwise disrupt this system hurts our most vulnerable students. Please be kind to one another.

Will Unsoeld was an American mountaineer who was part of the first American expedition to summit Mount Everest. He went on to become the director of the Peace Corps in Nepal, traveled around promoting Outward Bound, and eventually became a founding faculty member at Evergreen State College in Washington State, where he focused on experiential education. A hero to many, Unsoeld’s life and mission teach us many things. For me, it is an attention to the natural environment all around us. The quiet of this new world of social isolation has renewed my appreciation for the sunshine and flowers, and I hope that despite the stress and pain, you are enjoying these things too. Unsoeld, having conquered some of the toughest challenges in the world, also had this advice to offer about community:

“Take care of each other. Share your energies with the group. No one must feel alone, cut off, for that is when you do not make it.”

He was talking about high altitude trekking, but the same can be said for all of you, for all of us. I am so pleased by the spirit of caring and community I see all around UCI. I know that together, we can make it through this challenge. We will come out stronger on the other side.

Thank you for all you are doing. As always, I hope to see you soon."
30-Mar-20,474,Irvine,"Dear UCI Students,

In our commitment to student success, especially in this unprecedented time, the university has quickly pivoted to shift to remote operations and implement emergency distance learning procedures. We are writing to share information from the UC Office of the President regarding the assessment of student tuition and fees. We understand what a difficult time this is for everyone and appreciate that students and families are navigating their financial situation amid uncertainty.

Thanks to the extraordinary commitment of the university community, students continue to earn full credit for their coursework and receive a wide variety of services. Mandatory charges - such as tuition, the student services fee, nonresident supplemental tuition, professional degree supplemental tuition and charges for self-supporting graduate professional degree programs - continue to help cover the faculty’s delivery of instruction and other educational costs. These include substantial additional costs related to emergency distance learning, as well as the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid and remote academic advising. Given these services, the University of California has not changed its policies or practices related to refunds for these charges. UCI will comply with this guidance.

The University continues to function even as many staff and faculty are working and teaching remotely. While certain aspects of campus operations are curtailed during this transition, many of the costs associated with campus-based fees continue, and new costs have been incurred during this time. The debt owed for student buildings and facilities and our need to maintain campus infrastructure continue despite the current crisis. The campus is now incurring additional costs, such as laptop rentals and other emergency distance learning related needs. Although we have converted to a remote learning environment, students remain on campus, and certain services, such as Student Health and the FRESH Basic Needs Hub have become even more important to maintain for those who are still here.

If you have concerns or need support, we are here to help. Please reach out to the following offices with your individual concerns:

Financial Aid - visit www.ofas.uci.edu or email finaid@uci.edu

Counseling Services - UCI Counseling Center visit www.counseling.uci.edu or call 949-824-6457; for Graduate Division Counselors visit the Graduate Division Health & Wellness site at www.grad.uci.edu/services/health-and-wellness.php or email Elizabeth Dunn (dunnes@uci.edu) or Phong Luong (pbluong@uci.edu).

UCI Health COVID-19 Coronavirus Update"
1-Apr-20,1561,Irvine,"To All Members of the UC Irvine Community:

As a campus, UC Irvine has taken critical steps to protect our community and prevent continued spread of the COVID-19 virus. These steps have included following directives from federal, state and University leadership to stay home, avoid crowds, and promote social distancing. These are all vitally important actions for us to take at this time.

UCI CARE, Faculty and Staff Support Services, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) and UCIPD collectively recognize that staying at home and experiencing social isolation can create additional risk and may be dangerous for some members of our community, especially those experiencing relationship or family violence. Concerns about virus transmission introduce new tactics that may be used to impose control or manipulate a partner, and social distancing restrictions may create additional challenges related to safety, health, and confidentiality. External factors such as economic and health insecurity can add stress and create circumstances that further compromise safety.

UCI takes reports of sexual and domestic violence seriously and responds promptly and effectively to reports of such conduct. We are committed to continuing to support our UCI students, staff, and faculty who are affected by sexual violence or quarantined at home with an abuser. All services continue to be available, including assistance with workplace, academic, and housing accommodations.

Everyone can play a role: our campus community practices bystander intervention. We encourage those who are able to do so safely to continue practicing bystander intervention. Thank you for your partnership in creating a safe and harassment-free community.

Finally, sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited by law and by university policy. All employees, unless they are specifically designated by policy as confidential employees, are Responsible Employees and are required to report such incidents to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.

In support of our campus community, we have compiled the following list of resources to offer support and assistance for those in need:

UCI Remote Resources:

CARE provides free and confidential support services to all members of the UCI community (students, staff, faculty and affiliates) affected by sexual assault, relationship abuse, family violence and/or stalking. During limited campus operations, secure and confidential CARE Advocacy services continue to be available remotely. CARE staff are able to provide updated information about changes to court schedules, forensic exams and community resources. Advocacy services may include answering questions, providing information about rights and options, supportive measures that promote safety and well-being (for example: academic, employment or housing changes), virtual accompaniment to interviews and appointments, safety planning, financial support, and referrals to other services and resources. Video and phone appointments may be made by calling the CARE office at (949) 824-7273 or by email atcare@uci.edu. Additional information, as well as resources to support healing or coping, can be found at care.uci.edu and on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
UCI Faculty/Staff Support Services provides free/confidential virtual individual or group consultation via Zoom and support to resolve behavioral health issues, serves as a primary crisis intervention resource to facilitate and coordinate appropriate resources, provides time-limited case management for individual employees, and develops and implements instructional training and materials to assist in the promotion of mental well-being for all faculty and staff. We offer support for a wide range of issues (including: work related stress, relationship/couples issues, family problems, depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems, grief and loss, alcohol, drug and other addictions), consultations and training services for faculty and staff management. You can reach Dr. Negar Shekarabi at 949-824-5208 or nshekara@uci.edu

OEOD can provide guidance and consultation and resolve complaints informally, through an alternative resolution, or formally through an administrative investigation. The OEOD investigation is not a criminal process. If applicable, investigations at UCIPD and OEOD can be coordinated. Regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed, OEOD is able to assist with supportive and remedial measures such as changes to housing, changes to classes or work schedules, academic assistance, leaves of absence, withdrawals and extensions, financial aid assistance, Visa assistance, workplace accommodations, and providing information on University-issued ""no contact orders"" and ""stay away orders."" During limited campus operations, OEOD's services continue to be available remotely using Zoom. Reports to OEOD can be filed online through OEOD's website, via email to oeod@uci.edu, or by calling (949) 824-5594.
UCIPD provides a timely response to those experiencing crimes, including sex offenses.

2-Apr-20,505,Irvine,"To the UC community:

We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time.

The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together.

Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time.

To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus.

To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time.

To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID-19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible.

While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary.

Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together."

6-Apr-20,977,Irvine,"Dear colleagues, 

I could not be more proud to be an Anteater. It is a time of great stress as we care for our first COVID-19 patients and prepare for the apex of the curve in just a few short weeks. Our front-line caregivers, and all those who are helping friends and neighbors in the community, are standing together in service. They are not alone in this fight. Faculty, staff and students from every part of UCI are devoting their time and creativity. This is the true power of an academic medical center where taking care of others, especially the most vulnerable among us, is bolstered by the innovative inquiry and nimble responsiveness of a modern research university. Of the scores of examples, I will share a few today.



Ventilators are needed to care for many hospitalized COVID-19 patients but there are not enough across the United States to care for the large numbers of patients with respiratory failure admitted during surge conditions. To address the need, UCI Health otolaryngologist Dr. Brian Wong and anesthesiologist Dr. Govind Rajan partnered with Tom Milner, acting director of the Beckman Laser Institute & Medical Clinic, to design and build what they call a “bridge” ventilator that is an inexpensive, quick-to-manufacture device for intensive care units that have employed all their standard ventilators. It is now under review by the FDA.

There is an urgent need to develop effective therapies to treat active disease in COVID-19 patients. At UCI, Dr. Alpesh Amin, chair of the Department of Medicine, and Dr. Lanny Hsieh, a specialist in infectious diseases, are leading a clinical trial of the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Remdesivir is considered promising because it has previously been tested in humans with Ebola and has shown promise in animal models for treating MERS and SARS, which are also coronavirus diseases that emerged in 2012 and 2002, respectively. The randomized, placebo-controlled trial will provide the clinical data required to assess the effectiveness of the medication and side-effects.

The COVID-19 virus binds to cell surface proteins where they are processed by host proteases and this allows the virus to enter and hijack the internal cellular pathways in order to replicate and emerge in greater numbers. UCI chemistry professor Rachel Martin,  an expert in understanding how proteins function in living organisms, and her research team are working to develop a protease inhibitor that will prevent cellular  infection at its very first step. This approach has succeeded against previous viruses, including HIV, so it bears great promise. Other faculty across UCI are looking at each step from binding to release, developing molecular models, performing chemical syntheses, and creating new tests, and reaching out to work together to move projects forward quickly. 

Another critical need is for personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect healthcare providers on the front lines. UCI medical students kicked off a supply drive to help healthcare workers this week. The drive was organized by Jaspal Bassi, who received the help of more than 45 other medical students in this effort. The collection of these supplies will repeat every Saturday in April in the parking lot next to the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute on the UCI campus. In addition to PPE and sanitizer that are needed in the coming weeks, the medical students are helping to ease the burden on caregivers by walking dogs, babysitting and grocery shopping. Kudos to Jaspal and his fellow students.

On a related note, the faculty on campus have been scouring their labs and workspaces for PPE to donate to the medical center. They have also done a terrific job – and we are all very grateful.

Finally, let me share a preview of something that is happening next week. Faculty from the Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering have led an interdisciplinary team in the development, testing and production of a face shield that not only meets the necessary medical form, fit and functional requirements identified by hospital staff, but is inexpensive enough to be disposed after each patient interaction, the primary request from clinicians. Medical staff tested the prototypes to ensure that health system requirements were met. Upon that success, full-scale production began, and what started out as a small-scale 3D printing production of parts and assembly was transformed into a robust production operation at the University Partner Lab at UCI Beall Applied Innovation. It is expected that a first shipment of 5,000 masks will be delivered to the medical center in a few days.

These are a few compelling demonstrations of the unique strengths of UCI and the tripartite mission of health affairs -- to discover, to teach and to heal -- and the seamless synergy we enjoy across the university from our undergraduate classrooms to our ICUs. The mission is also a bond that brings together the best minds to deliver leading-edge healthcare to Orange County, the state of California, and to the nation. Innovation is in our DNA.

In closing, I want to congratulate Chad Lefteris on his appointment as CEO of UCI Health. We have worked together for well more than a year, and I want to share my confidence that Chad is just the right person to lead UCI Health now through this COVID-19 crisis, ensuring that our frontline caregivers have the tools and resources they need to provide exemplary care during the pandemic, and also in the future as a critical member of the health affairs leadership team that is bringing patient-centered, team-based, integrative healthcare to the nation."
6-Apr-20,829,Irvine,"Happy Monday everyone,

We don’t have a huge update today. Apparently, the rain kept away the news. Hopefully, you all got to jump in a few puddles today or cuddle up on the couch under a blanket. As for me, my home office is a closet (literally) with no windows, and so for a brief moment I thought we had a rat infestation on the roof, but no it was just raindrops.

A few things to draw your attention to as we continue to respond to this new normal. Please attend to issues of accessibility in your research, teaching, and correspondence.

Accessibility During COVID-19
In Accessibility Suffers During Pandemic, Inside Higher Ed describes how students with disabilities and their advocates worry about access to equitable education. Our Disability Services Center has been working around the clock to ensure our students have appropriate access. Please reach out to them if you need help, can volunteer to help others, or have questions.

Microsoft also published an interesting article, What the disability community can teach us about working remotely, in which they describe working with and learning from their employees and by continuing to prioritize accessibility in these shifting circumstances. Microsoft has been a leader in inclusive hiring and work practices. It is nice to see them continuing to do so.

Division of Career Pathways Services Update 

Please note that DCP will continue to offer one-on-one career counseling appointments through both Zoom andphone as well as “virtual office hours” on Wednesdays from 1-3 to temporarily replace in-person drop in times.

6-Apr-20,906,Irvine,"Summary: Check in with yourself, marshal your coping strategies, and reach out to campus resources during this challenging time.


Dear Anteaters:

I write from my front porch, where a warm sunshine and a gentle breeze remind me that spring arrived a short while ago, right around the time we were packing up residence halls and offices. I didn't take the time to notice this seasonal transition as we began imagining what it was going to be like to learn, work, and socialize from a distance, and so I'm doing so now. I'm also taking stock of what has grown lately, around me as well as within me: my capacity to cope with uncertainty, my tolerance for the unknown, and my knowledge of technology.

In order to acknowledge the growth that can occur after a trauma or dramatic change (often referred to as post-traumatic growth), it's important to notice the event(s) that prompted that growth. COVID-19 has been that event for all of us, thrusting us into a new normal, and life has changed in large and small ways for us all. I'd like to invite us all to take a moment and simply acknowledge this change as we find a path forward.

For many of us, it has been a difficult transition, and we cannot ignore that this period has been challenging for the world, our nation, and for members of our very own community. At the same time that we have been presented with new opportunities to turn inward, spend time with loved ones, and use technology in exciting new ways to stay connected, these first weeks have been, for many, characterized by uncertainty, anxiety, fear, or sadness. We have lost some of our routines. Some of us have had to confront economic uncertainty, as well, prioritizing essential expenses, scaling down, or realizing how we can mobilize our resources to help others who are experiencing difficult circumstances. A colleague refers to these sorts of challenges as ""character-builders,"" and I would say that we have had no shortage of those over the weeks.

We cannot cope with what we don't acknowledge or notice, so as you begin this new spring term, I encourage you to spend some time noticing. Give space to the grief, frustration, or loss that you might be feeling. Notice how this feels in your body. What has this loss done to your appetite, ability to sleep, or ability to connect with others? In what ways are you or are people in your life a little more short-tempered, anxious, or angrier, and how can we be more compassionate to ourselves and to others during this time? What have you learned about yourself as the seasons have changed? How has this pause created new opportunities to connect with friends and neighbors, regenerate your energy, or appreciate those aspects of your life that we are sometimes too distracted to notice?

Then let's take several deep breaths in, allowing us to reengage those parts of our brain that often get hijacked during high-stress situations. We're going to need a lot of collective deep breaths during this time of uncertainty. Although we look forward to the future when we can resume portions of our normal lives, we are going to need to marshal our coping strategies now. Here are a few tips:

If it helps, keep a journal or write down what you and your family are experiencing right now. The scientific literature suggests that writing in order to better understand your emotions can have both mental and physical health benefits.

Notice the hallmarks of a good day and make a plan to repeat what worked well.

Savor something delicious, whether it's homemade, take-out, or delivered to you

Find some aspect of the arts (dance, theater, poetry, music) that inspires you.

Reach out for help if there is some aspect of telecommuting or distance learning that is unfamiliar, and try to be quick to answer a question for someone who appears to be struggling.

Keep abreast of national and local headlines, but turn media off periodically. Take time to unplug, rest, and just notice what's happening right now in this unprecedented time in our history.

Noticing allows us to marshal our coping resources. One of those coping resources might be professional help. If you find that you are noticing depression, a worsening of a pre-existing mental health condition, an unshakeable anxiety, or any other symptoms that could use a professional lens to understand, please do not hesitate to reach out to campus resources, which are available to you even if you have left campus:

I encourage students to reach out to the Counseling Center (counseling.uci.edu) by calling (949) 824-6457. During business hours (Mon-Fri 8am-5pm), to schedule an appointment or for all other inquiries, leave a message and the office will call you back within 2 hours during normal business hours. If you cannot wait to be called back within 2 hours or are calling after business hours, select option 2 to speak with a counselor by phone.

Faculty and staff can reach out to our Employee Assistance Program by calling (844) 824-3273 or accessing services at wellness.uci.edu/facultystaff/eap/introduction.html, which also links to other campus resources.

Best wishes for the spring quarter, and may the opportunities and challenges ahead prompt reflection, compassion, and the best of the human spirit."
6-Apr-20,149,Irvine,"HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS)
The COVID-19 crisis has put the physical collections of many research libraries out of reach, including ours. Fortunately,HathiTrust holds digital copies of many of these works. They have created an Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS), which opens up copyrighted material in the HathiTrust Digital Library to member institutions with copies of those items in their physical collections.

Millions of digitized books available through HathiTrust which are also in UC libraries’ collections are now available online to UC students, faculty, and staff. Use your UC credentials to login to theHathiTrust Digital Library, and then check-out in copyright books for online reading access for renewable one-hour loans. You can also still, as before, read and download public domain books at will.

7-Apr-20,377,Irvine,"To provide the necessary tools to support the rapid transition to online learning and remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most UC locations expanded their use of Zoom for teaching, research, telemedicine, and administration. Ten UC locations have obtained site licenses to provide Zoom access for all faculty, staff, and students.

As the university’s Chief Information Officers, we are very aware and concerned that Zoom is experiencing security and privacy issues. Our UC IT security and privacy experts are closely monitoring these issues and Zoom’s responses.

Zoom has been quick to respond to these issues, including the timely release of security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. UC locations also have issued guidance for their users, which is found below. Such guidance will be revised as necessary, based on any new findings.

In addition, UC has a systemwide agreement in place with Zoom, which includes the UC Data Security Appendix and a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement. The terms of this agreement address UC’s needs and provide greater security and privacy protections than Zoom’s standard agreement terms.

Privacy and security are a joint responsibility of both Zoom and our UC communities. There are a few keys steps all of us can take to best ensure the privacy and security of our Zoom interactions:

All Zoom users should install client software updates as soon as they are available.
Zoom meeting hosts should set their accounts to provide the highest protection for the privacy of all meeting participants in accordance with their location’s published guidance (listed below).
All Zoom users should periodically check their location’s published guidance for updates.
In sum, Zoom has been responsive to the security and privacy concerns and, while it is important for our IT security and privacy experts to monitor the situation, we believe that at present Zoom continues to be an appropriate option for online learning and remote work.

8-Apr-20,1460,Irvine,"The impacts of the coronavirus on America’s most vulnerable communities
Richard Matthew, UCI Blum Center Faculty Director

22 years ago, I wrote an article with a colleague from Georgetown University entitled “Sex, Drugs and Heavy Metal: Transnational Threats and National Vulnerabilities.” It was published in the journal Security Dialogue.

In it we argued:

The increasing degree and rate of human mobility throughout history has created an opportunity for infectious disease to spread with devastating consequences. The plagues that swept across medieval Europe, the smallpox carried to the Americas by the Spanish, and the cholera, malaria and AIDS that wreak havoc today testify to the enormous impact infectious disease can have on a vulnerable society. Today, drug resistant viruses and new pathogens uncovered as people carve their way into rainforests can be transported unintentionally across the globe in hours. The ingredients for an epidemic--including infected livestock and foodstuffs, poor hygiene, inadequate sanitation systems, drug resistant pathogens, and rapid and extensive human contact--are largely in place for a transnational catastrophe. Despite widespread recognition of these problems, recent national responses to two of the world’s deadliest diseases demonstrate how state-centric policies tend to inhibit appropriate preparations and responses.

We concluded that:

The state, which evolved to provide security from both domestic and external threats, is being constrained by its historical legacy as it struggles to respond to transnational security issues. We must be prepared to vanquish the next Nazi Germany, but we must also be prepared to confront the Ebola virus, mass migration, weapons proliferation, drugs, and terrorism. As new technologies unsettle traditional patterns of behavior, we must find new ways of providing for security. The challenge ahead is to adapt the state to this new environment, and devise transnational structures competent to address transnational threats.

As new technologies unsettle traditional patterns of behavior, we must find new ways of providing for security. The challenge ahead is to adapt the state to this new environment, and devise transnational structures competent to address transnational threats.

We argued for extensive global cooperation, for including new perspectives and expertise in our security thinking, and for developing institutions fully dedicated to understanding and responding to disease pandemics and similar threats.

We were certainly not alone in arguing that the United States was failing to address transnational threats posed by infectious disease, environmental change and terrorism. We were part of a noisy community of rather pessimistic researchers whose views have (too) often been ignored. Our concerns, however, have received considerable support from real world events—including 9/11, the worst droughts, floods and fires in our history, the largest forced displacements of people since World War II, and, now, the novel coronavirus. It is sad and frustrating that some of the steps taken to realign national security with the realities of the post-Cold War era, and to build architecture around a vision of human security focused on the rights and dignity of all Americans, and of people around the world with whom we are deeply interconnected, were pushed back in ways that place ideology above science. We have been left less prepared than we could have been.

Less prepared to anticipate and respond to transnational threats, and less prepared to address another empirical reality that the dire events of the past two decades have brought into focus. Simply put: while everyone in our society suffers during these types of crisis, the poorest members of our society suffer more than everyone else. And in many ways their suffering lasts much longer.

The 78% of our population, according to a 2017 CareerBuilder report, living pay check to pay check; the 40% of our population unable, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve study, to pull together $400 in an emergency; the 40 million Americans currently living below the poverty line—these people are far more likely to be displaced from housing they can just afford towards housing they really cannot afford. They are more likely to lose their jobs or take pay cuts. They are more likely to face crushing unexpected bills—and be unable to pay them—and have their credit ratings plummet as a result. More likely to lose their cars. More likely to have their education interrupted. More likely not to have insurance policies in place that protect them. More likely to become even more vulnerable to subsequent shocks—like a recession. More likely to find themselves in desperate need of assistance. And more likely to be neglected, and to enter a downward spiral that might entrap them permanently.

Our moral beliefs are clear: those with capacity have a responsibility to assist those in need. And the imperatives of prudential behavior are also clear: the welfare and safety of all are diminished when we fail to act to alleviate forms of poverty and inequality that generate despair, deepen distrust and increase volatility in our political and economic systems.

The novel coronavirus has and will continue to hurt many people in this country, and insofar as everyone is at some risk, it will do so free from “discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” But over time it will almost certainly play out very differently in the two halves that make up America, because one half is simply far more resilient than the other. We cannot erase inequality, but we can reduce its most dangerous forms. The differential impacts of the coronavirus can be mitigated dramatically through inclusive policies, contextually sensitive interventions, targeted and adequate financial assistance, and acts of kindness and compassion. The skills and knowledge needed in this regard are the backbone of the educational programs we have designed to prepare the next generation of leaders for California, the US, the planet.

We also have created a new web page dedicated to reporting on the impacts of the coronavirus on America’s most vulnerable communities. We invite you to contribute—your views, stories, compelling visuals, evidence-based studies, and to help us identify resources that are available to those in need.

10-Apr-20,842,Irvine,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Nucleic Acid Detection Tests
Background:
Effective immediately, the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine will be testing nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and nasal specimens collected from individuals with suspected COVID-19 infection on two additional platforms. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct are real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2. The table below highlights the differences between the 4 platforms that are now available.

Effective date: April 10, 2020                                                                                              

Important Considerations: 
For simplicity and conservation, one nasopharyngeal swab is sufficient and recommended for both COVID-19 and influenza/RSV testing if both tests are requested using the Xpert Flu kits.
Oropharyngeal and nasal swabs should be combined in one vial.
The rapid ePlex, Cepheid, and DiaSorin platforms should only be considered when fast turnaround time is required and requires approval of the designated clinical team due to limited reagent availability.
Clinical accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated.
A few published studies suggest that viral loads are highest early during the disease course (3-6 days after symptom onset)1-4
A “Not Detected” (negative) result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. This result should be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.
Due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 propagation for laboratory personnel, viral cultures (code: CULVRS) from respiratory sources are temporally discontinued at UCI and our reference laboratories per government COVID-19 guidelines.
Turnaround time (TAT) estimates do not include order-to-collection or collection-to-receipt times.

21-Apr-20,226,Irvine,"Dear Campus Community, 

UCI again experienced an incident of Zoombombing yesterday during a public lecture event. Zoombombing describes an individual or a group of individuals misusing Zoom features to interrupt a meeting or class, often with criminal, vulgar, or inappropriate images or chat messages. 

These incidents are unacceptable at UCI. If you experience Zoombombing, please report it to techprep@uci.edu. Yesterday's event was suspended immediately, and the recording was turned over to law enforcement for criminal investigation.

As COVID-19 pushes classes to remote learning environments, incidents of Zoombombing have occurred across the country. Usually, the perpetrators are seeking to spread hate and intimidate targeted communities. 

It is important to note that UCI has procedures in place to secure remote meetings, and everyone is encouraged to use them. Moreover, the campus acts to prevent and remedy the disruption of presenters, speakers, instruction and other university activities. Please see UCI's guidance for the disruption of university activities for more detailed information. 

I encourage you to visit UCI's interdisciplinary virtual workshop, Racial Violence and Restorative Engagement in a Time of Pandemic, as a resource to explore divisive issues amplified in a pandemic environment and how we can be responsive in ways that promote collaboration and understanding. "
22-Apr-20,236,Irvine,"I am delighted to announce the launch of OC-COVID19.org, a new website devoted to providing timely, useful, evidence-based information about the novel coronavirus pandemic to our friends and neighbors across Orange County.

UCI and UCI Health are at the forefront of Orange County's response to this national emergency. Every day there are stunning examples of remarkable, cutting-edge clinical care provided by the UCI Health family. Our services are driven by innovation and research taking place across the university. In this way, the UCI community is leading the way to solutions that are local and global.

At OC-COVID19.org, you will find the latest information from expert voices on your health and wellness, testing, clinical trials, policy, technology, education, social issues, as well as insights and analysis on the real-life implications of these developments.

There is appropriate concern and uncertainty about COVID-19; particularly, how we should act today and what our lives will be like in the future. As a premier public institution, UCI is committed to sharing accurate information about the disease and its impact.

Our aspiration is for this new site to be a valued resource that informs, engages, and reassures Orange County residents and those they love.

22-Apr-20,214,Irvine,"As a campus, we take great pride in providing a wonderful student housing experience for our students, and, under normal circumstances, offering guarantees for this housing to a large percentage of our student body. However, it is not possible for us to know at this time whether the current public health crisis will allow us to maintain normal operations in student housing and residential life when the fall quarter begins. Consequently, we are not offering a housing guarantee at this time.
 
We are committed to having students on campus to the maximum extent possible. But, it will be some time before we know more precisely how many students we can safely accommodate in our housing units. Additional information will be provided by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as we have more to report. For more information about this as well as other expected changes for fall 2020 as they are determined, please visit our FAQ page here.

24-Apr-20,361,Irvine,"Hello Anteaters:

The 2020 Census is well underway and Californians have begun receiving invitations to participate from the U.S. Census Bureau. This marks the official beginning of the historic count that will determine the distribution of federal funding and accurate assessment of the population for the redistricting of our state and federal districts for the coming decade.

You can now respond to the Census online at my2020census.gov and by phone by calling the numbers below.

Wondering which location you should fill out on your census form if you were displaced by COVID-19? The U.S. Census Bureau wants you to complete the form with where you were supposed to be living on April 1. College students who live off campus but have left their college or university because of COVID-19 should respond online or by phone using the address of their college/university community (not their parent or family address).

If you stayed in or left on-campus housing, UC Irvine will be submitting a ‘group enumeration’ response for you – so no action is needed on your part!

The questionnaire is quick, easy, safe, secure and confidential. The U.S. Census Bureau is bound by law to protect your answers and keep them strictly confidential. In fact, every employee takes an oath to protect your personal information for life – pursuant to Title 13 of the U.S. Code. (Punishable by jail time and/or a $250,000 fine)

Phone lines are now open to provide information about the 2020 Census and assistance with the questionnaire. Support on all language lines will end on July 31, 2020.

27-Apr-20,396,Irvine,"Dear colleagues:

Opportunistic cybercriminals are targeting individuals and organizations with COVID-19 related attacks. These attacks come in the form of malicious “phishing” emails, SMS texts, phone apps, and websites. In many cases, their goal is to get you to click on a link, open an attachment, or install an app, that will infect your device with different types of malware (including ransomware) that will steal and/or destroy data. In other cases, the goal is to get you to divulge personal or financial information to the attacker.

COVID-19 related themes that attackers have attempted to exploit include:

Communications pretending to come from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or other health organizations
Fake online maps and tracking sites for COVID-19
Donations to charity or relief organizations
Personal protective equipment (PPE) scams
Cancelation of events
Stimulus checks
Remote work offers
Rent and mortgage relief
Common red flags to look out for include:

Suspicious email address – a majority of phishing emails can be spotted by looking at the sender’s email address. If the sender address looks suspicious, it is recommended to verify if the email is legitimate. For example at UCI, if you ever receive an email with uci.edu before the “@” symbol it may be a scam. Scammers also like to create accounts on free email services like Gmail and Hotmail and set the “From” address to the person they want to impersonate.
Generic or non-routine message – most of the time attackers don’t have internal information, so their messages are very generic. These can also include unexpected “too good to be true” offers or asking to perform non-routine requests.
Sense of urgency – attackers like to take advantage of our emotions and often times create a sense of urgency to get us to respond. Particularly now when most of us are working remotely and our usual methods of interaction have changed, the authenticity of our communication is much more vulnerable.
Misspelling, typos, unfamiliar languages – most phishing emails are not written very well and can contain grammatical errors.
Additional phishing awareness resources are also available on the OIT Security website.

Please forward any suspicious emails that you want checked to OIT Security at spam@uci.edu.

Please email OIT Security at security@uci.edu with any other questions."

In this unprecedented time, UCI confronts a variety of digital accessibility issues. Regardless of the challenges, we stay committed to accessibility and equity, both in our work environment and in our educational mission.

We have fostered a strong partnership between the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD), and the Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation (DTEI). While each office is issuing guidance specific to their area, we wanted to provide an aggregated list of resources and an overview for those who are new to the principles of digital accessibility.

Below is information regarding policy, principles, and resources for addressing digital accessibility. Additional information can be found on the Accessibility.uci.edu website. Should you have follow-up questions about digital accessibility, please contact a member of the IT Accessibility Work Group; Meredith Ehrenberg, IT Accessibility Work Group Co-Chair; or Andrew Berk, ADA Coordinator.

We invite you to join the effort to expand UCI's inclusion of all members of our community in our digital domain.

_Policy

The University of California IT Accessibility Policy establishes that information technology should be designed, developed, and procured to be accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies. Some key information technologies are:

websites
course materials and anything related to instruction - including syllabi
group and individual emails
interoffice memos
training materials, etc.
While we offer students an opportunity to register for services through the Disability Services Center and employees can request accommodations through their department with the assistance of Human Resources, no-one is required to disclose a disability. We should therefore assume that any digital materials that we produce may be used by a person with a disability and ensure all materials meet these guidelines to the best of our ability.

_Accessibility Principles

These quick perspective videos are a great way to familiarize yourself with some of the principles of IT Accessibility and how different users may interact with your content.

_P-O-U-R

POUR is an acronym for four high-level principles that describe functional accessibility: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Perceivable: the user can identify content and interface elements by means of the senses. For many users, this means perceiving a system primarily visually, while for others, it may be sound (read aloud by a machine) or touch (as on a Braille device).
Operable: ability to use controls, buttons, navigation, and other interactive elements. For many users, this means identifying an interface control visually, and then clicking, tapping, or swiping. For others, a computer keyboard or voice commands are required.
Understandable: consistent in presentation and format, predictable in design and usage, concise, and appropriate in voice and tone.
Robust: standards-compliant; designed to function on all appropriate platforms.
_Resources

General

Siteimprove scans websites for accessibility issues and provides periodic reports. To obtain a new account and register your site for Siteimprove, go to siteimprove.ucop.edu. From there, users can auto-provision an account using their UCInetID. Then send an email to oit@uci.edu including which site to have scanned and the user(s) who will need permission to the site.
The Accessibility website includes a library of short training videos on various topics. You can sort and filter to find recommended courses based on your role here on campus. Each video is just a few minutes long.
You can also find information on closed-captioning vendors on the Accessibility website. Note that any videos you use or promote should include captions, whether you created the video or not.
The UCOP Electronic Accessibility Testing Website provides links to software that developers can use to test their products for accessibility prior to launch.

29-Apr-20,248,Irvine,"Dear Colleagues,

I am writing today to provide an update on the campus research enterprise. As you know, since March 21, 2020, we have restricted campus research to only approved critical research projects. I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the campus research community for the cooperation and sacrifice in response to the message dated March 17, 2020 calling for ramp-down and curtailment of non-critical research on-campus. Your commitment to the health and safety of the UCI and surrounding community has been immensely helpful.

As you may have seen, Governor Newsom has outlined plans for relaxing Stay-at-Home orders. In anticipation of such relaxation and reopening, I have spent the last few weeks working with the University of California Council of Vice Chancellors for Research, leaders of schools and research centers, Academic Senate Council for Research, Computing and Libraries, and campus leadership on planning for the  restart of research activities on-campus. We have made very good progress during this time and we anticipate being ready to restart, in a phased manner, on-campus research in the near future.

Since the precise dates for the restart are still to be decided, please continue to adhere to the current restrictions and conduct only the approved critical research work. I hope to be able to communicate with you soon on the research restart."

Campus-Community Research Incubator Grant Program

Application Deadline: June 1, 2020

Overview

The Campus-Community Research Incubator Program (CCRI) is a small funding mechanism designed to foster collaborative research-oriented projects between university researchers and community organizations. Annually, there are two levels of grant funding available: 1. Pilot CCRI $8,000-$10,000 (for research applications) and 2. Mini CCRI $3,000-$5,000 (for capacity and partnership building applications). Additionally, this special request for applications allows for the provision of COVID-19-related community-engaged research projects up to $20,000. Potential applicants are encouraged to attend a workshop on general application preparation. A registration link for this workshop can be found below.

The estimated funding period is July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021.

All applications must be submitted electronically.

 

Eligibility

Grants are awarded only to teams comprised of UCI researchers and community organization representatives. Applicants can be:

501(c)(3) community organizations located in southern California
UCI-based researchers, including faculty, healthcare providers, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, or senior researchers
Proposals must demonstrate an active engagement between UCI researchers and community representatives. Specifically, projects must demonstrate they are co-designed and clearly state the anticipated benefits to each partner.

All projects require regulatory compliance (e.g. UCI Human Research Institutional Review Board [IRB] approval or an exemption determination, required trainings) to be met prior to funds being released. It is recommended that the IRB application be submitted prior to final submission of this funding application. In addition to UCI IRB approval, community organizations may have their own IRB processes.

All personnel on proposals must take the Human Subjects Protections and HIPAA tutorial prior to funds being disbursed.

Tutorials: Human Subject Protection and HIPAA  https://www.citiprogram.org/Default.asp 

Types of Awards

Research-based activities: Pilot CCRI $8,000-$10,000

Research activities include but are not limited to data collection, analyses, and/or pilot studies.
An example of a pilot CCRI is a study that will generate findings to be further studied or tested in a larger follow-up research study. Typically, CCRI funds are adequate to determine feasibility. Sometimes a statistically-significant sample can be obtained, but this is not an expected outcome of CCRI-funded projects. For information on the expectations and limitations of seed grant funding, please see this article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081994/
Fifty-one percent (51%) of research funds must be distributed directly to the community partner.
COVID-19-related research: Pilot CCRI $10,000-$20,000

COVID-19 partnered research projects include but are not limited to data collection, data analyses, and/or pilot studies.
Successful applications will demonstrate potential for a positive impact on our mission to understand and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and the measures taken to control the spread of the virus. Responsive applications might include interventions to address social, biological, psychological, familial, medical, or community impacts of COVID; studies to establish and/or address needs created by COVID and/or its related impact on human services and health; topics around equity and disparities in control and mitigation of the virus; surveillance and contact tracing; epidemiology; testing; or psychosocial impacts of social isolation, infection, and caregiver experience, for example.
Priority will be given to innovative questions, methods, or approaches that involve community-based participatory research methods.
Capacity- and partnership-building activities: Mini CCRI $3,000-$5,000

Capacity-building and project planning activities include but are not limited to trainings, data set organization, technology, project development for future research
Community-engaged research is a unique genre of research requiring specific skills, approaches, motivations, and methodologies. Working directly with community entities to conduct translational research often entails health equity/racial and economic health disparities interests. Addressing these social determinants of health requires sensitivity to- and understanding of the unique contextual circumstances driving equity disparities within specific populations. In turn, this type of research requires investment in developing relationships and trust within communities, with an eye toward long-term collaborative work. Given the specialized nature of community-engaged research, we feel it is important to communicate clearly the mission, goals, and requirements for this request for proposals and have, therefore created workshops for faculty and community researchers to learn more details on application preparation, as well as provide an opportunity for questions and answers to be addressed. 
We strongly encourage all potential applicants to attend one of these workshops. Workshops are scheduled for May, and registration can be made at the link below.

Awardees are expected to develop a poster that presents their findings and display the poster at an annual UCI/ICTS Translational Science Day. Additional information will be given in the notice of awards.
Awardees are required to acknowledge the ICTS in all publications and presentations.
Selection Criteria

Awards will be made competitively. In general, proposals that demonstrate the following will be given highest priority:

Focus on integrating innovative community-based practices that accelerate discoveries toward better health and healthcare delivery and/or contribute to the understanding of clinical translational science and the social determinants of health.
Have formed or established a partnership (an existing partnership prior to applying for CCRI). Partnership development and fortification are a primary mission for this grant mechanism, so a special emphasis on the nature of the academic-community partnership should be apparent.
Demonstrate project ingenuity/innovation.
Have a high likelihood of meaningful positive impact (ex. changing clinical care in a positive way, future research possibilities).
We will preferentially consider proposals with in-kind support.
Those with existing IRB approval.
The CCRI applications for research activities are rigorously reviewed by UCI faculty and community partners. Each application will have at least one review from an academic and a community member.  Please be sure to clearly indicate to which funding mechanism you are applying.

8-May-20,255,Irvine,"To All Members of the UC Irvine Community:

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Education issued Title IX final rules mandating how universities across the country respond to complaints of sexual harassment starting in August 2020.

The University of California's policies and procedures largely comply with the final rules, and there will be system-wide discussions regarding any necessary modifications in the weeks ahead. The UC system has publicly expressed concerns about a few key provisions in the rules, including the proposed definition of sexual harassment and the regulations surrounding cross-examination in hearings.

In the UC President's statement on Wednesday, President Janet Napolitano made clear that the UC system will continue working to ensure that our response to sexual harassment and sexual violence reports is prompt and equitable, emphasizing that the University of California ""remains steadfast in our commitment to our students and community and will respond to the rules with care and thoughtfulness.""

At UCI, our leadership takes proactive steps to address sexual harassment and provide services and resources for those impacted. That will not change. We remain committed to ensuring that students, staff, and faculty are able to participate in their education and employment free of sexual harassment. 

If you would like additional information, a compilation of resources follows this message. Feel free to contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity with questions and concerns.

Thank you for your commitment and contribution to making UCI a safe and harassment-free space."

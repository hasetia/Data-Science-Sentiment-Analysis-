2-Mar-20,"Dear Texas State Community,

As news continues to evolve about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is understandable there may be concern on our campuses and in our community. I am providing this update to inform you about the precautionary measures being taken at Texas State University. I also want to stress that this is a time for all of us to demonstrate compassion, civility, and personal responsibility as we make the best decisions for our community.

Currently, no cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the Texas State community. However, it is critical to prepare as the situation evolves and more cases are identified in the United States and around the world. The Presidents Cabinet, our Chief Medical Officer Emilio Carranco, M.D., and the universitys Emergency Management Committee will continue to closely monitor the situation and follow federal and state guidelines as we take appropriate precautions.

Stay Informed:

Moving forward, all official university-wide communication about COVID-19 will come via email from Dr. Carranco via the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA) office with the subject line: Coronavirus (COVID19) University Update. The Student Health Center has created a webpage to provide the latest COVID-19 information for our Texas State community. 

Travel:

 University-approved travel (including study abroad) is prohibited to areas designated Advisory Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or 4 (Do Not Travel) by the United States Department of State, in accordance with The Texas State University System travel policy. We recommend you consult the U.S. Department of State travel advisories, especially as Spring Break is approaching, and take necessary precautions.

 Students, faculty, and staff returning from Level 3 designated areas are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. For those not able to quarantine at home, the university has designated a facility as an isolation area. Those returning from Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for 14 days. Dr. Carranco is working with all returning individuals to guide them through the self-quarantine and self-monitoring processes. 

  Non-official or personal travel to Level 3 and 4 restricted areas is strongly discouraged. Students, faculty, and staff who choose to visit Level 3 and 4 areas will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return. Those traveling to Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for signs of illness. This is for the protection of everyone in our community.

 The university will continue to monitor U. S. Department of State travel advisories and remain in close contact with students, faculty, and staff in study abroad and non-study abroad programs.

Protecting yourself and our community:

 We all have a responsibility to maintain the health and wellbeing of our community by following recommended respiratory hygiene practices and not exposing others to contagious illnesses.  If you feel sick, stay home from classes or work. Students who are ill and need to be absent from class should contact the Dean of Students office at (512) 245-2124. Faculty and staff should notify their supervisors. In addition, we urge you to follow these prevention guidelines to limit exposure to illness.

 As we focus on our Texas State community, it is also important to remember everyone around the world impacted by COVID-19. Avoid stereotyping or stigmatizing any individuals or groups and follow our Bobcat values, including treating all with respect and dignity.

 We will continue to monitor this situation and provide you with periodic updates. The health and wellbeing of every member of our Texas State family remains our top priority, and we will continue to take all necessary precautions.

 

Sincerely,

 

Denise M. Trauth

5-Mar-20," The City of San Marcos in coordination with Hays County, Texas State University, Congressman Lloyd Doggetts office, local school districts, regional and state agencies, met Wednesday, Mar. 4 to coordinate and discuss efforts underway to address Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

 While COVID-19 is not an immediate threat to our community as no cases of the virus have been confirmed in Hays County at this time, we are partnering with county-wide organizations and state public health officials to monitor trends and prepare our organizations and residents, said Rachel Ingle, the Citys Emergency Management Coordinator. 

 From todays Hays County press release, Hays County Local Health Department Epidemiologist Eric Schneider explained how the public can take preventative measures to protect themselves and their families against illness. Essentially, they are the same healthy behaviors that can prevent a flu outbreak:

 Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds several times a day, including between your fingers and underneath your nails. Handwashing is considered the best way to remove germs and dirt, and hand sanitizers should be used only when handwashing is not available. The hand sanitizers should be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective. 
Avoid handshaking and high-fives;
 Avoid touching your face  especially your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Stay home when you feel sick;
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue then put the tissue in the trash, or use the crook of your elbow if a tissue isnt available;
 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household disinfectant cleaning spray or wipe. Clean cell and desk phones, computer keyboards, door handles, and work surfaces often.
Face masks are not considered an effective way to prevent someone from catching a virus unless you have close, frequent contact with a sick person; however, they are an option for sick people to use to keep from spreading the virus;
Avoid travel to areas that have been designated high-risk areas because of multiple verified cases of COVID-19.
 The public should note that Coronaviruses are not new  some are responsible for common colds and some for more serious infections like SARS  but this particular strain of the virus is new which is why it is often referred to as Novel Coronavirus. Its formal name is Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) since 2019 was the year it was discovered.

As of March 5, no cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Hays County, and only a few individuals who believe they may have been exposed to a confirmed case are in self-quarantine and are being monitored as a precaution to protect our community, Schneider said. While we are anticipating cases to eventually show up in Hays County, the first line of defense against an outbreak or community spreading is to follow good health practices whether you are healthy or feeling sick.

 Contact your healthcare provider or the Hays County Local Health Department at 512-393-5520 if you have any questions about COVID-19 or if you are concerned that you have been exposed.  The Hays County Health Department has a monitoring protocol in place which will be explained to you if warranted.  If you are experiencing symptoms, you may be directed to your local hospital emergency room.

 For additional qualified information about COVID-19, visit the Texas Department of State Health Services or the Centers for Disease Control. For media inquiries, contact communicationsinfo@sanmarcostx.gov.",Texas State University
6-Mar-20,"Dear University Community,

 As new cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerge and our university community prepares for spring break, I want to share some expanded travel restrictions and important updates to safeguard our faculty, staff, and students.

 As a reminder, we have launched a COVID-19 webpage as a source for critical and updated information.  Please check your Texas State email and the website to stay informed.

Situation Update

 As of this date, no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported on our San Marcos or Round Rock Campuses, or in Hays County or Williamson County.

Education Abroad Programs

 Effective immediately, all Education Abroad programs for spring break and summer are being cancelled.  We will continue to assess future programs as the situation evolves. The university is working to provide alternate options for students registered for the cancelled Education Abroad trips.  

 If you enrolled in an Education Abroad program that is being cancelled and you have questions, please call the Education Abroad Office at 512-245-1967 for assistance.

Students in Education Abroad programs in countries with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designated Travel Warning Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) have already been recalled and required to self-isolate for 14 days. 

Faculty, Staff, and Student International Travel

 University-affiliated international travel by faculty, staff, and students to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 is restricted. Approval for official university international travel for faculty, staff, and students will be evaluated on an individual case basis at the Presidents Cabinet level. 

 Faculty, staff, and students who choose to travel for personal reasons to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 will be required to self-isolate for 14 days before returning to a Texas State campus.  If a countrys warning level increases to a CDC Level 2 or 3 during the visit, the faculty, staff member, or student will also be required to self-isolate before returning to campus.  Check CDC Travel Warnings for the  latest information.

Class/Work Absence Due to Illness

 Providing a healthy, safe working, and learning environment is a priority.  It is essential that faculty, staff or students who have a potentially contagious illness stay home and not go to class or work.  Persons who appear ill and have symptoms such as cough, fever, and sneezing will be asked to leave the workplace or classroom.  Students who miss class due to illness should contact the Dean of Students office (phone: 512-245-2124) and work with their professors to discuss how to manage course work while absent.  Faculty and staff who miss work due to illness should follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.

Self-Isolation Requirements

 Faculty, staff or students required to self-isolate must follow the CDCs guidance for effective and safe isolation (How to Self-Isolate).  Self-isolation may be required by a public health authority or a medical provider.  A medical note verifying the need for isolation must be provided upon return to school or work.  Faculty or staff required by a public health authority or a medical provider to self-isolate will follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.

Personal Health and Safety

 As COVID-19 continues to spread both in the U.S. and abroad, it is important that you carefully consider where you are travelling.  Avoid areas where there is evidence of COVID-19 spreading.  Practice effective prevention measures such as staying away from those that are sick, washing your hands frequently, and staying home if you are ill.  If we work together and follow the guidance provided, we can help protect our Bobcat community.  For the latest information on COVID-19 and the universitys response measures, please check TXST COVID-19. .

18-Mar-20,"Dear Texas State Community,

 COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States but there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Texas State campuses at this time.  The university has implemented a variety of measures to decrease the risk of exposure to our community.  International and domestic travel have been restricted.  We have increased infection control.  We are implementing social distancing. For a list of cancelled events, click here. We are sharing information about prevention, proper self-isolation, and safely seeking medical care.  Slowing the spread of COVID-19 requires that we all do our part by staying home if sick, practicing social distancing and following the instructions of our healthcare providers.

 Travel is a significant concern, especially as spring break ends.  I want to remind our campus community about the following travel policies:

 Persons returning from countries with a CDC Level 2 or 3 Travel Health Notice are required to self-isolate for 14 days before coming to a Texas State campus.  International travelers should send an email to healthcenter@txstate.edu with information about travel destination(s) and dates of travel so that we can monitor your health and provide you with medical documentation.  Information on how to self-isolate can be found at Steps for Isolating.  
 Persons traveling within the United States, especially to areas with community transmission such as Washington, California and New York state, should self-monitor and social distance for 14 days.  Temperature should be checked in the morning and afternoon daily.  Signs of illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath should be assessed daily.  Social distancing should be practiced by avoiding crowds and maintaining some distance with others while at home or work as much as  possible.  If an illness develops during the self-monitoring period, stay home and consult with your healthcare provider by phone. 
The Student Health Center is introducing Telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our patients and staff.  All patients requesting an appointment for evaluation of a respiratory illness will  have  a Telehealth visit with a medical provider first.  The medical provider may be able to provide care and treatment without a personal visit or may determine that the patient needs to come to the Health Center for further evaluation and testing.  COVID-19 testing is still limited and can only be conducted if criteria are met for testing.  Faculty, staff and students are eligible for COVID-19 testing if within the last 14 days they had:  1) direct contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or 2) recent international or domestic travel to an area with community transmission of COVID-19 and develop fever (> 100F), cough and shortness of breath.  To request an appointment, call the Student Health Center at 512-245-2161.  For more information about COVID-19, check the CDC website at Coronavirus 2019.

We  have a significant challenge ahead of us and many are understandably concerned.  Lets turn that concern into action.  Lets look out for each other and do our part!

19-Mar-20,"Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

 This is a difficult time for all of us, and it requires me to share information that I know will have a tremendous impact on our Texas State University family. To protect our students, faculty, and staff from the ongoing spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), the decision has been made to move courses to remote or alternative delivery beginning March 30 through the end of the spring semester.  

 Members of my Cabinet, other key university administrators, and I considered every aspect of this unprecedented decision and what it would mean for our students, but in the end, out of the utmost concern for everyones safety and health we reached this conclusion.

 Ensuring students can easily access their remote course material is our primary focus. All undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to complete the courses for which they are currently enrolled.  We will work to find solutions for students without off-campus access to a computer or Wi-Fi. Students who have questions or need support can contact the IT Assistant Center (ITAC).

In  accordance with national and state recommendations on social distancing, we request our students living in residence halls or in Bobcat Village Apartments return home or make other off-campus living arrangements for the remainder of the spring semester. We realize moving out of a residence hall is not an option for everyone, and are committed to being flexible for special considerations. Those who need to remain on campus will have limited access to services and facilities, such as the  LBJ Student Center and dining options. Clearly, there will be fewer opportunities for interaction due to the need for social distancing and thus the cancellation of university events and activities. The Department of Housing and Residential Life will communicate directly with on-campus residents about how to apply for an exception to remain on-campus, establish a time to retrieve belongings and move out, and the process for receiving a financial credit for housing costs.

For  Bobcats planning to graduate in May, I know you are concerned about spring commencement ceremonies. We are moving spring ceremonies to August 6 and 8 to coincide with summer commencement. An updated schedule of those ceremonies will be available soon here.  I am so proud of our students graduating in May, and look forward to celebrating that achievement with you and your families in August. It is important to remember if you are eligible to graduate at the end of this spring semester, you will still receive your degree and a diploma even if you are not able to participate in the rescheduled commencement ceremonies.

 Understandably, these developments will generate many questions from our students regarding course completion and credit, access to technology you need to learn and work remotely, and housing options. Our Texas State faculty and staff are prepared to make the transition as smooth as possible and are here to help you navigate the process. We will continue to share detailed information as we respond to COVID-19. To stay informed, check your university email often, and visit the COVID-19 webpage for the most recent updates and helpful FAQs.

 I am extremely grateful for our Texas State staff and faculty who have worked tirelessly to support our university community, and who will help us overcome the challenges ahead. I know their work is done out of dedication to and love for our Bobcat students.

 These are extraordinary times that call on the best of our Bobcat spirit, grit, compassion, and determination. I am proud to be a part of this amazing community, and your safety and well-being will continue to be my highest priority.


Be well Bobcats.

 

Sincerely,

23-Mar-20,"Dear Colleagues,

Every day, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 bring new challenges and decisions for us to face professionally and personally. I have seen you all meet these difficult times with perseverance, creativity, hard work, and sincere care and empathy for our students. I have never been prouder. 

To enable Texas State University employees to comply with shelter-in-place or other restrictions that may be issued by local or state officials, we are providing the following guidance regarding managing your work schedule.  

We recognize these shelter-in-place restrictions may eventually affect many, if not all, of our employees and students.  Texas State is committed to providing flexibility and appropriate work options that not only answer the needs of our employees, but ensure the continued operation of the university.  These extraordinary times require us to provide additional support to our students as they adapt to their changing learning and living environment. It is critical that the students on our campuses and those working remotely have access to the services and facilities they need to be successful. 

The Presidents Cabinet has reviewed the essential offices previously identified for energy conservation and weather emergencies and adjusted the list for this situation. To meet the universitys needs, we have determined that offices identified as essential to university operations (listed at the end of this email) must have at least one full-time employee in the office on the San Marcos Campus, and as applicable, on the Round Rock Campus, during the normal 40-hour work week. The appropriate cabinet member may determine if more individuals are needed to perform the necessary work responsibilities.

All other employees not physically on one of the campuses are expected to work remotely for 40 hours per week.  The expectation is that anyone working remotely is reachable, available, and demonstrating work outcomes. These individuals must submit the Remote and Telecommuting Work Agreement and have it approved by their supervisor. I encourage you to review the Staff and Faculty section here on the COVID-19 webpage for important information on working remotely.

We understand that some employees for various reasons may not be able to work remotely from home. In those cases, they should plan to come to their office on our campuses and follow the work schedule as approved by their supervisor while maintaining the recommended social distancing protocol. Supervisors can also approve flexible work hours (e.g., early mornings, late evenings, and/or weekends) to accommodate our employees professional and personal needs. Temporary staff and student employees, including those on assistantships and work-study appointments, may also be extended the option to perform work from home. 

As a reminder, university mail services will continue to operate for the remainder of the semester on the spring break schedule outlined here in the Campus Services and Support section of the COVID-19 FAQs.

Thank you for your continued patience as we work to find the best solutions to keep our Texas State community safe and operational. I appreciate each and every one of you.

Sincerely,

The majority of Texas State faculty and staff are working remotely, and essential personnel on the San Marcos Campus and the Round Rock Campus are following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) social distancing guidelines. Public universities are considered an essential function of state government and are required to remain open with limited on-campus staffing. Texas State President Denise Trauth provided information to employees via email on March 24 regarding university essential offices and functions.

Beginning March 30, Texas State courses are moving to remote or alternative delivery through the end of the spring semester.

In accordance with national recommendations on social distancing, students living in university residence halls have been asked to return home for the rest of the semester. For students who are unable to make other living arrangements, Texas State is providing special considerations. Those who remain on campus out of necessity will have limited access to services and facilities.

Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of state government and must remain open with essential staffing while stay-at-home orders are in place. We will continue to provide services to the more than 38,000 students enrolled in courses and to our students who continue to live on the San Marcos campus.

Texas State has been preparing for this possibility by adjusting our remote work and telecommuting policies, encouraging flexible work schedules, revising our list of essential university offices, and working to support our employees who will be working on-site and remotely during this time.

I encourage you to read the shelter-in-place information posted on the Faculty and Staff COVID-19 FAQ page which is being continuously updated as new information is available.

An essential employee card that you can print yourself is also available on the FAQ website.

26-Mar-20,"Dear Students, 

Hays County Judge Ruben Becerra has issued a Stay at Home Order for Hays County, including San Marcos, that goes into effect at 11 p.m. tonight, March 26. The order includes a curfew from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m., except for essential workers whose employment requires it. Exceptions are made for essential services and businesses. We encourage you to read the statement from Hays County. The full order is available here. Williamson County, which includes our Round Rock Campus, is also under a similar Stay At Home order.

Texas State University supports these orders for protecting the health and wellness of our university community and the larger communities we call home. Its imperative that everyone in the Bobcat family comply for the health and safety of our entire region.

The COVID-19 webpage Frequently Asked Questions have been updated in light of the order, including the following helpful information:

The library will remain open with modified hours with many online support services to all faculty and students. Students can still go to the library when remote courses begin Monday.
Additionally, students who are living on campus may continue to use the library and other university facilities as an extension of their home environment, while carefully following appropriate social distancing and other prevention measures.
We will continue to provide limited on-campus dining options and shuttle services, as well as other on-campus services. Visit Campus Services and Support in the FAQs to learn more.

26-Mar-20,"Dear Colleagues,
 
As we prepare to welcome back our students to the completion of the spring semester through remote and alternate delivery methods, I want to thank you all for your leadership during this time of unprecedented challenge.  I am very proud of the dedication you have shown to our students and each other as we have made difficult decisions to protect our community.  Now as the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more apparent, we must prepare for the reality that the events attendant to the virus will have an impact on our financial future.
 
I strongly believe that we are doing the right thing by changing our traditional campus life to allow students to complete their courses from the safety of their homes.  The health of our students, faculty, and staff will continue to be my highest priority.  We know that these decisions will result in a loss of already budgeted funds, and it is in this context that we also must prepare for the additional financial losses we could experience in the coming weeks and months.
 
We anticipate that our summer enrollment will be significantly less than in previous years, and that fall enrollment could also be negatively impacted.  It is prudent that we act now to conserve our resources for the future.  By acting quickly, we hope to be able to continue to provide the best possible educational environment for our students and to protect our employees.  
 
Therefore, I have asked my Cabinet to implement the following changes to our budgets. We will temporarily delay all new personnel actions including the posting of new positions and hiring to fill vacancies.  Certain exceptions will be allowed, such as the Vice President for Student Affairs, which I consider a critical position.  Requests for exceptions will be reviewed by the appropriate Cabinet member and require my approval.  

For the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends on August 31, 2020, I am restricting expenditures from operating budgets to 50 percent of the remaining balances.  The remaining 50 percent of the funds will be placed into savings accounts in your own budgets to provide a safety net in case these funds are needed in the next fiscal year .  
 
Currently, all university sponsored travel is cancelled.  This policy will remain in effect until health experts indicate it is safe to travel.  We know that many faculty members are planning to submit papers and proposals for delivery at academic conferences.  Assuming the lifting of shelter-in-place restrictions, faculty members can make submissions for conferences beginning with the next academic year.  Other travelers must receive an exception given by the appropriate Cabinet member . 
 
Since it is imperative for everyone to exercise tight fiscal controls on expenditures, additional cost savings measures in the area of facility construction have been identified and these include the delay of any renovations, improvement projects, or optional facility projects until the next fiscal year.  However, continued enhanced cleaning and routine facility repairs will be conducted as needed.  
 

I know that you will have many questions regarding how these changes will be implemented, and I have asked Provost Gene Bourgeois and Vice President for Finance and Support Services Eric Algoe to provide further details in the coming days.  
 
These changes will undoubtedly cause hardships and difficulty across our campuses, and I sincerely hope that many of the cost-saving measures will prove to be unnecessary in the months to come.  However, we would be remiss in our responsibilities as leaders if we do not act now.  The extraordinary challenges created by COVID-19 demand unprecedented fiscal discipline.  I will continue to keep you updated as we address this evolving situation .

Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of state government and must remain open with essential staffing. Public transportation is also exempted from the Hays County Stay at Home Work Safe order issued March 25, 2020, as it does provide some individuals with their only access to health care, food, and other essential services.  Operating under the Stay at Home Work Safe order, Texas State continues to provide services to the more than 38,000 students enrolled in remote courses, some of whom do not have the option to move off campus and remain in our residence halls, or require the use of university facilities.   

Bobcat Shuttle riders must comply with social distancing and other practices the university has implemented to make riding the bus as safe as possible.

Texas State University leadership is making important decisions to prioritize the health and well-being of the Bobcat Community, while continuing the essential work of running a university. 

Since these declarations may result in eligibility for COVID-19 federal funds, Texas State made changes to the e-NPO screen to track costs and seek reimbursements upon availability of funds. On each e-NPO document, select Yes or No indicating whether the expense is related to COVID-19.  Note: The form will not allow you to list both types of expenses on the same e-NPO document.

Monday begins a new journey as we resume our spring semester classes through remote delivery .

I know this is not the way any of us imagined the second half of our spring semester, but it is  what these extraordinary times require. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we have made difficult decisions to keep our campuses safe, and to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.

No matter where you are today, know that our Bobcat community remains strong, and all of  us at Texas State University are invested in your success as we adapt to a new learning environment.  

As we begin classes under stay-at-home orders from Hays County, Williamson County, and  surrounding counties, I want to emphasize that Texas State is considered an essential government agency and remains open with limited staffing to serve you. Many of our employees are working remotely, while others are practicing social distancing to keep essential offices operating on our campuses. Adhering to the stay-at-home orders is critical for the health and safety of our entire region and I encourage you to read our COVID-19 FAQs for updates and information on available services while the orders are in place.

I am very proud of how our dedicated faculty and staff have met the challenge of moving  over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery over the last two weeks. They faced this task with innovation, hard work, and determination to serve you well during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that you can easily access your remote course material and finish the semester strong is our primary focus. If you have questions or need support, please contact the IT Assistance Center (ITAC).

Not only are courses available remotely, but several of the universitys other support services such as counseling and academic advising can now be accessed online. Please take care of yourself during these stressful times and reach out to the Counseling Center if you need additional support. 

As we begin to adapt and find some comfort in our new normal, continue to keep yourself and others safe by following the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including social distancing and hygiene, as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For students who do need to physically come to our San Marcos Campus or Round Rock Campus, we have taken measures to ensure the environment is as safe as possible for you.

In my 17 years as president of Texas State, weve never experienced anything like this -- but I have also never been prouder. This challenging situation has amplified our fundamental Bobcat values of compassion, service, perseverance, and dedication. I am humbled by the actions of our health professions faculty and staff who have donated their time and equipment, including loaning ventilators to area hospitals, to help the greater cause. Our Student Affairs and Housing and Residential Life staff are working hard to help 4,000 students move from residence halls safely, or find a way to stay if they didnt have a suitable housing alternative. The Student Health Center transformed its health care delivery to include a telehealth to keep students well. Our alumni have reached out to offer encouragement and support to the university and to our students. Through kindness and hard work, our university family is making a difference, and I look forward to sharing more of these uplifting stories in the upcoming days and weeks.

Most importantly, I am impressed by each of you. I know there is apprehension and uncertainty along with disappointment for what you are missing, but I am confident in your resilience and tenacity. We are here to give you the support you need to navigate these next two months. And, for those of you who are seniors, I cant wait to celebrate commencement with you in August.

Every division, department, college, and program -- on both campuses -- have  moved quickly to adapt our operations in the face of great difficulty and ever-changing circumstances. 

Once we announced the decision to transition to remote instruction, staff in  several parts of the university immediately established a comprehensive set of workshops and consultations to ensure faculty were effectively supported for the transition. Faculty responded quickly, converting over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery. Academic departments, schools, and colleges are also providing training and other support services for faculty, and adopting new tools and technology to shift to remote instruction. Our IT personnel have provided support, troubleshooting, training, and new resources to help make the transition as smooth as possible.

University-wide, departments and programs are being creative and finding ways  to share their services remotely and stay connected with our students. The Student Health Center launched telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our students, faculty, and staff. Our custodians have gone above and beyond to disinfect some of the most high-traffic areas of our campuses to promote our health and wellness. Many of you have been go-to sources of information and expertise for reporters, students, and fellow academics regarding the pandemic and its impact on society. I also applaud the work of Academic Affairs, planning the logistics of moving more than 5,000 soon-to-be graduates from our May commencement ceremonies into August ceremonies. There are countless stories to tell about the hard work that has taken place here -- stories we plan to share far and wide in the coming weeks.

While all this work has been happening behind-the-scenes, everyone in our Bobcat  community has juggled the needs of their loved ones, families, friends, and children. Many of you have children who are out of school, or parents and family members who are elderly or have preexisting medical conditions. All of this brings added fear and anxiety into our Bobcat community. I want to take a moment to recognize how difficult it has been for everyone, and thank you for your contributions during this trying time. Youve worked hard to stay student-centered and I am incredibly grateful for your support and dedication.

Its also important to recognize the critical work of people outside our university but integral in our community -- healthcare workers, civil service employees, sanitation workers, first responders, journalists, grocery workers, nonprofit workers and volunteers, military personnel, utility workers, and mail carriers. Many people in our university community have loved ones who have worked around-the-clock in these essential roles. We owe them a debt of gratitude as well.

Today, I also sent a message to all of our students to reiterate we are here to support them as they navigate the rest of this semester, and to remind them of services that remain available thanks to the hard work and creativity of our staff and faculty.

The  university has shared several messages with you over the last week pertaining to what the recent stay-at-home orders mean for university operations, how public universities are required to remain open with limited on-campus staffing, and staffing for essential offices. If you have any questions, I encourage you to speak with your supervisor. 

While  many of you are continuing your daily work remotely, we know there are employees whose jobs and responsibilities require them to be on-campus. To express our gratitude, we are providing a free to-go lunch daily on both campuses. Look for an email from Dining Services for all the details on how to enjoy a delicious and convenient meal every day that you are on campus.

In closing, please know I share this message of thanks on behalf of the entire Presidents Cabinet. We are all moving into uncharted territory together, but because of the caliber of our faculty and staff, I know that we will continue to provide a top-tier education and student experience, while living up to our values. Thats what makes Texas State so special.

 

Sincerely,

 

Denise M. Trauth

27-Mar-20,"Today, the university learned that a  faculty member in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19.  The faculty member became ill during spring break on 3/17/20 while away from the San Marcos university campus. Subsequently, the individual was seen by a primary care provider who later confirmed a positive COVID-19 test result.  The faculty member, who lives in Austin, is recovering well and a full recovery is expected.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials.  

The faculty member was on campus on March 9th and 11th before the universitys spring break.  The faculty member was completely asymptomatic while on campus.  After consulting with the local public health authority, it has been determined that the risk of transmission to others on March 9th and 11th was very low.  Since the faculty member has not returned to campus since March 11th, and it is past the 14-day incubation period, the public health authority is not recommending any specific measures be taken by the university at this time.  

As COVID-19 continues to spread across  our country, it is important that everyone follow local directives for social distancing or shelter-in-place, and adhere to CDC guidance on prevention measures such as staying away from those who are sick, washing hands frequently - especially before touching your face or eating, and staying home if ill.  These are difficult times and I hope all are healthy and safe. Lets keep doing our part to stop the spread of COVID-19.

27-Mar-20,"Bobcats, we know you are excited to register for summer and fall 2020 courses. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we are delaying the start of summer and fall registration by one week to April 6.

In this ever-changing environment, we want to be sure we have enough time to make decisions that are best for your safety, your education and your future. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we plan for the future.

Registration for Summer and Fall 2020 begins at 7:00 am on April 6, 2020.

Time tickets are assigned based on classification (e.g., senior, junior) but also divided into time slots based on overall hours earned as of Monday, March 2, 2020.  Time Ticket Information.  To find out what times you qualify for, log in to Texas State Self Service.

Reminders:

Check if you have  holds that will prevent you from registering.

If you receive a Registration Error, learn how to respond to it so you are able to register.",Texas State University
31-Mar-20,"As part of  the transition to remote instruction for the spring 2020 semester, Texas State University will make a temporary change to the final grades policy. This change will provide students with the option to request modification of final course grades to the EP (emergency pass) grades. The modification request may only be utilized for courses in which the student earned a passing grade. See the University Registrars definition of grades: https://www.registrar.txstate.edu/our-services/grades.html.

The decision  to allow this flexibility is in direct response to the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19. The universitys remote courses will continue to maintain the highest quality standards. Students are expected to participate in class activities, assessments, and assignments throughout the remainder of the semester. As usual, faculty members will assign final grades to students using the criteria and performance standards outlined for the course. 

Once final  spring 2020 semester grades are posted, students will have until Monday, May 25, 2020 to submit a written modification request to their professor(s) requesting an EP grade. Upon approval, the professor will make the grade change. To be considered, all requests must be made in writing to the professor by the stated deadline. The modification request option is limited to spring 2020 courses only. Students make requests on a course-by-course basis.

Students are  encouraged to consider the consequences of an EP grade, including those for prerequisite course requirements, GPA calculations, GPA minimums for certain programs, academic standing, admission to other programs or universities, financial aid, veterans benefits, scholarships, and other academic matters. Students should contact their academic advisor or academic program coordinator for specific questions. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to consult with their graduate advisor about the impacts of an EP grade before seeking a modification request.

Faculty members  are encouraged to be flexible but have the authority to make their own decisions on these requests. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/.

Students may appeal  a faculty members decision using the procedures outlined for the department, school, or college in which the course is taught. The appeal process is applicable for all grades, including those under review by this temporary change to the final grades policy.

I realize this has not  been an easy transition and thank you for your patience and understanding as we assess options and make decisions in the best interest of the university community.",Texas State University
1-Apr-20,"Laboratory-based  science is an important component of our research mission at Texas State University.  Circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic now require us to work together to temporarily restrict access to laboratories on the Texas State campuses for the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students, and to comply with the stay-at-home directives now in place throughout Central Texas.  On March 27 we shared some initial guidance, and now we are providing information on implementing the restriction. 

The Stay-at-Home/Work  Safe order issue by Hays County and Williamson County prevents individuals from leaving their homes except for purposes of essential activities or to perform or obtain services from an essential business, essential governmental function, or critical infrastructure.  Regarding universities, there is language allowing for essential activities that include performing critical research, or performing essential administrative functions.  Based on these orders all university research laboratories at Texas State are restricted from access except for individuals performing essential tasks.

Understandably there are questions as to what constitutes essential research activities. First, all research at Texas State is important so that alone is not the benchmark for defining essential.  Also, it is true that a pause in routine research activity will have consequences regarding collection of data, publication of research results, and other usual benchmarks of progress.  So, while very unfortunate, a disruption of these types of outcomes is not synonymous with essential in the present context.   

It is impossible to provide a definition of essential that will cover the unique circumstances  for all research activities at Texas State.  One example of performing an essential function is an individual who enters a research laboratory for a brief visit to assure that there are no issues related to the equipment or other components of the facility.  This is very different from going into the facility to conduct experiments and collect data which, in general, would not be considered an essential activity.  In rare cases, a more ongoing activity may be approved as essential (see below).

For the duration of the stay-at-home orders and other precautions in place related to the  coronavirus outbreak, the goal is to have an intentional change in activity from a business as usual mode to focusing only on critical functions in the laboratory. 

So, without trying to be fully inclusive or exclusive, research laboratory access is limited to  a very small number of personnel who maintain essential research-related actions that include:

performing a brief walk-through of the laboratory to make sure that everything is OK.
activity that if discontinued immediately would generate significant data and sample loss.
activity that if discontinued would pose a safety hazard.
activity that keeps critical equipment and infrastructure in facilities and laboratories safe or avoids catastrophic loss.
activity that maintains critical samples, reagents, and materials.
activity that maintains animal populations.
activity that maintains critically-needed plant populations, tissue cultures, bacteria, archaea, and other living organisms.
COVID-19 related activity that has a timeline for deployment that could address the crisis.
activity in support of essential human subjects research.
Also, as we have indicated in previous communications, students cannot be compelled to participate in research laboratory-based activities, even those identified as essential.  In no case may there be academic or professional retribution against students who decide not to participate in such activities during this time.

Please act immediately to transition laboratories to restricted access.  The restricted access mode should  be fully in place by Monday, April 6.  If any essential activity is planned beyond intermittent brief walk-throughs, you will need approval of the planned activity from Dr. Michael Blanda, Assistant Vice President for Research, who will review requests in conjunction with the Chief Research Officer.  Please contact Dr. Blanda via email at blanda@txstate.edu.

Thank you for your understanding and leadership during these unprecedented circumstances.",Texas State University
1-Apr-20,"I  hope everyone is doing well and adapting to remote and alternative course delivery for the spring semester. Texas State University is here to support our current and future Bobcats during this time of disruption. Im pleased to announce today that we are providing emergency financial aid and adjusting the delivery of Summer I courses to better meet your needs during the COVID-19 crisis.

To  make summer 2020 courses at Texas State as accessible as possible while ensuring the continued safety of our students, faculty, and staff, we will move scheduled class sections that start meeting at any point in June to online/remote delivery, and return to face-to-face and online classroom delivery for the Summer II session (July 6 - August 5). Please note that the decision regarding the Summer II session could change according to public health advice and conditions.

Making the  decision now to move Summer I to online/remote delivery gives you the ability to plan accordingly for the future during these still uncertain times, and allows students to continue toward reaching their educational goals.

I want to be  clear: Summer courses are not canceled, only moved to online/remote delivery for the Summer I session.

Registration for the Summer and Fall 2020 semesters will open on April 6, 2020.

Here is what you need to know about moving Summer I courses to online/remote delivery:

3-Apr-20,"Let me begin by  acknowledging the tremendous efforts by our faculty, staff, and students in making the first week of remote instruction a success.  As we end this historic week, I wanted to answer several questions, highlight resources, and provide reassurance that the university is here to support you every step of the way.

Academic Freedom

Texas State University  affirms its commitment to academic freedom and will take steps to ensure intellectual independence, free investigation, and unfettered communication by the academic community.  President Trauth and I reaffirmed this commitment at our monthly PAAG meeting with Faculty Senate a few days ago.  Through our core values, Texas State protects and celebrates academic freedom in an atmosphere of integrity, respect, civility, and compassion.  Faculty Senates Academic Freedom Committee provides more information on this fundamental tenet in higher education: https://www.txstate.edu/facultysenate/committees/freedom.html.

Academic Integrity

With the sudden transition  to remote instruction, many faculty are concerned about ensuring academic integrity in the new environment.  Fortunately, the university has several options for gaining more information, including the video, Prompt Preparation for 100% Online Instruction and the University Honor Code, a 15-minute guide to proactively influence academic integrity in an online course.  In conjunction with the Honor Code Council, Faculty Development will offer a workshop and Q&A period, Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, on Wednesday, April 8, 2020 from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. via Zoom.  Go here to learn more and sign up for this interactive session: https://signup.txstate.edu/sessions/6035-4-8-2020-their-cheating-hearts-tips-for-maintaining-academic-integrity-while-teaching-remotely. 

Classroom Recordings

Faculty members have asked  about posting the recordings of online class sessions where student participation occurred.  These recordings reflect the teaching and learning process, so instructors often post them for students to watch or re-watch.  If access to the recordings is securely limited to other students in the same class section, student privacy protections do not limit or prevent access and do not require obtaining a written consent.  Faculty may post these recordings in TRACS or Canvas class sites that are protected by student identification and authentication features.  The recordings may not be distributed by anyone, including students, to third-parties without obtaining written consent from the instructor, students, and other participants.

Community of Practice

Every Friday at 12:00 noon Faculty Development is hosting Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty members to visit, exchange ideas, and find ways to take care of each other, ourselves, and our students as we navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning.  Topics are based on faculty suggestions.  The topic for Friday, April 3, 2020 is We Made It! This come-and-go Zoom session is time to share what is working in your classes and to hear ideas on best practices for surviving and thriving in this new learning environment.  This lunchtime gathering will be informal, informative, and fun. Join here on Fridays through May 8, 2020 at 12:00 noon: https://txstate.zoom.us/meeting/register/vJclcumrrz4iVcPlJrf-D7D2np1OYGrZqw

Copyright

Faculty own the coursework  they create, and the university has a license to use it for education and marketing purposes.  If you wish to restrict use of class materials and lectures, including recordings, written instructions should be provided to students.  See more information on copyright provisions and a suggested written statement to students (section 03.01) in AA/PPS 02.03.01, Commercial Use of Class Notes and Materials.  Additional information on copyright and remote teaching is available from the universitys Copyright Office and the librarys remote course support webpage. 

Finding Time to Read, Write, and Think

If faculty are trying to carve out  space for thinking, reading, writing, and other deep work, join Faculty Developments new program, Write Watchers. The group will meet via Zoom every Tuesday, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon, beginning on April 7, 2020.  In a Write Watcher session, each participant sets goals at the beginning and then reflects on what was accomplished at the end. In between, microphones are muted and faculty do deep work, with other supportive faculty working alongside them.  To join, follow this Zoom link on Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m.:https://txstate.zoom.us/my/writewatchers.

Zoom-bombing

A few faculty members have  reported instances of Zoom-bombing, where an uninvited person accesses and disrupts a Zoom class session, often using inappropriate language and graphics. Visit ITACs helpful resource on how to lockdown Zoom sessions to avoid unwanted visitors: https://itac.txstate.edu/support/online-meetings/lockdown.html.  Remember the first rule of Zoom: Dont give up control of your screen. 

Next week, I will provide updates  on other questions, including those related to EP grades, professional development requirements for faculty teaching online this summer, the employee assistance program, student evaluations of teaching, and the tenure clock for tenure-track faculty. Until then, I hope you and your loved ones are well.
",Texas State University
3-Apr-20,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

Today the university learned that a student in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19 on March 30, 2020.  The student came back to campus with a parent to move out of the residence hall on March 27, 2020.  The student was asymptomatic at that time and did not have close contact with anyone other than the parent.  The student has had only mild symptoms thus far and we hope for a quick and complete recovery.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials. 

The  Department of Housing and Residential Life developed a phased move-out process as a social distancing measure to reduce the risk of close or prolonged contact between persons during the move-out process.  Since the student was asymptomatic and had no close contact with anyone on campus besides the mother, the risk of exposure to others was very low.  It has been determined that no particular actions are necessary at this time.  However, this notice is being sent to comply with the requirements of the Clery Act.

Under  the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), institutions are required to immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation occurring on the campus that involves an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees. The Clery Act includes the outbreak of a serious illness as a significant emergency. Although this specific case does not rise to the level of significant emergency, the university is erring on the side of caution and acting in the spirit of the Clery Act.  Consistent with guidance from the Department of Education, Texas State will carefully analyze any subsequent or additional COVID-19 incidents on a case-by-case basis and will issue additional reports only if other significant factors call for a follow-up notification.

Sincerely,

Emilio Carranco, M.D., M.S.

8-Apr-20,"Dear Round Rock Students, 

 You may be aware that Williamson County, including our Round Rock Campus, is under a Stay-At-Home order through 11:59 p.m. on April 30, 2020. The order was issued by Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell and is intended to help control the spread of COVID-19 by keeping people isolated at home. I encourage you to read the statement from Williamson County and the full order. 

 Texas State University supports this order for protecting the health and wellness of our university community and the larger communities we call home. Its imperative that everyone in the Bobcat family comply with the directive for the health and safety of our entire region.

 While this order is in effect, students should not come to the Round Rock Campus. As you know, courses are being provided by remote or alternative delivery through the remainder of the spring semester. If you have questions about your individual program, contact your faculty supervisor for specific information. The university is working with accrediting and certification authorities to address program academic guidelines moving forward and will provide updates when available. 

Public universities such as Texas State are considered an essential function of government and will continue to operate with limited staffing during the Stay-At-Home order to serve our students. Many of our employees are working remotely and are reachable via email to address your questions and concerns.  I encourage you to visit the Texas State COVID-19 webpage for information and updates.

By working together, making smart choices, and complying with local and federal guidelines on prevention and mitigation, we can slow the spread of the virus.

10-Apr-20,"As we end our second week of remote instruction, this message provides responses to feedback and questions received by my office on matters related to Texas States COVID-19 response. This weeks roundup begins with four decisions that were made after consulting the Faculty Senate and academic leadership.

EP Grades
The university has implemented a one-time process for spring 2020 that allows students to request that a final passing grade be changed to Emergency Pass, or EP, upon approval of the instructor of record. Students are responsible for submitting written modification requests to faculty by Monday, May 25, at 5:00 p.m. and for assessing the impact of EP grades on their GPAs, program requirements, financial aid eligibility, and other academic factors. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/. Faculty are encouraged to check with their chair or director for any questions regarding EP grades. Information resources include the provosts March 31, 2020 email and FAQ for students.

Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online
The Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL), along with staff in Information Technology (ITAC) and Faculty Development, will support faculty re-designing courses for distance learning for the summer I term. AA/PPS No. 02.03.20 Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program. By mid-April, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from ODEL about how to access the program.

Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in professional development for online instruction. For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program. Questions may be directed to the Office of Distance and Extended Learning at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceed@txstate.edu. 

Student Evaluations of Teaching
Weve received questions about the effect of remote instruction and other changes on student evaluations of teaching for spring 2020 courses. Faculty will have the discretion to include or exclude spring 2020 results in their annual evaluation documents and tenure and promotion files, without prejudice. Faculty, chairs, directors, personnel committees, and other evaluators are encouraged to review spring 2020 student evaluation of teaching results for the purposes of professional growth. This is an opportune time to reinforce a long-term and holistic assessment of teaching effectiveness via peer observations, student learning outcomes, artifacts of learning, philosophy of teaching statements, syllabi review, and other means.

Tenure Clock for Tenure-Track Faculty
The COVID-19 pandemic has created circumstances that may impact productivity of tenure-track faculty who have a mandatory and limited probationary period before the tenure and promotion decision. These circumstances may warrant a request to toll the tenure clock. See section 03.01.g of AA/PPS, 04.02.20, Tenure and Promotion Review for more information. The policy is being updated to reflect these circumstances, as well.

Tenure-track faculty are advised to consult with their chair, director, and others before making a request to toll the tenure clock. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure and promotion review is scheduled for the next academic year (FY21) may make a request no later than May 31, 2020. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure review occurs in FY22 or later have until May 31, 2021 to make a request. The request memo originates with the faculty member and requires approval by the chair/director, dean, provost, and vice chancellor for academic and health affairs at the Texas State University System. Contact Tammy Sharp, director, faculty and academic resources, for more information: tsharp@txstate.edu or 512.245.2475.

Academic Integrity
 In response to strong faculty interest, Texas State held a workshop on academic integrity in remote instruction earlier this week. See Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, including an extensive Q&A session, here: https://mediaflo.txstate.edu/hapi/v1/contents/permalinks/Dm43NrZi/view. Closed captioning is enabled for the video.

Community of Practice
 Over the past few weeks, faculty have sought ways to stay connected, move projects forward, and strengthen professional relationships. Make plans to join Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty to exchange ideas about ways to navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning and Write Watchers to carve out time and space for thinking, reading, writing, and other completing deep work.

Employee Assistance Program  Bobcat Balance
 The university offers a comprehensive set of employee assistance services through the Bobcat Balance program. All faculty, staff and graduate student employees in benefits-eligible positions, along with members of their households, are eligible to use the program. The program includes resources and services related to personal finances, child care, elder care, legal matters, health and wellness, and other areas. Please explore this valuable employee benefit.

Supporting Students During Uncertain Times
 Many students feel especially vulnerable at this time. Beyond changes to instruction, some students have moved back home, lost jobs, or are caring for young children and family members. The College Transition Collaborative provides advice on communicating with students with clarity and compassion. Texas States Counseling Center has a COVID-19 resource page, including a webinar on April 17, 2020 to support student resilience and success.

 Next Friday, I will provide updates on questions and decisions that emerge during our third week of remote instruction. Keep up the outstanding work! I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy.

Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online

 AA/PPS No. 02.03.20  Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program.  Soon, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from the Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL) about how to access the program.  Other participants are welcome, including those who completed the program in the past.  Questions may be directed to ODEL at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceedu@txstate.edu.

 Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in the professional development program.  For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program.  Some faculty scheduled to teach during Summer I may not yet have a netID.  These faculty are still required to meet the requirement and will need guest accounts in Canvas until their net IDs arrive.  Their names, along with a request to add them to Canvas as a guest user, may be sent to distanceed@txstate.edu.

23-Apr-20,"Faculty and Staff,

 While social distancing, hand-washing and staying home if sick remain the most important strategies for slowing the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  Based on this CDC recommendation, Texas State University is encouraging faculty, staff and students working on campus whose work makes it difficult to maintain social distancing to use cloth facemasks.  Employees can purchase their own cloth facemask through a variety of online retailers or in the TSUS marketplace, or find many easy do-it-yourself mask-making guides online such as those provided by the CDC at Cloth Face Coverings.  Surgical masks or respirators should be reserved for medical professionals, public safety officials and laboratory environments.

 The university has secured approximately 2,000 cloth facemasks for employees who cannot obtain one from other sources, and will provide up to two cloth facemasks upon request.  Facemasks may be picked up at the University Distribution Center located at 305 River Ridge Parkway in San Marcos, Texas or can be delivered by requesting them using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form.  When using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form, select Other for Item Needed and enter Facemask in the next field to identify the item needed.  In the Number of Cartons Needed field, enter the names and employee ID numbers of up to 5 employees in the same office.  For those wanting to pick up facemasks, please call the University Distribution Center at 512-245-2294 to get a time for pick up between 8am -12 pm or 1pm - 5pm. 

 Asymptomatic persons infected with COVID-19 can unknowingly spread infection.  Facemasks can help reduce the risk of spreading infection to others.  It is important to review these Facemask Use and Care guidelines to learn how to properly use, store and clean re-usable cloth facemasks.  Improper use of a face mask reduces its safety benefits and increases the risk of exposure.  If deemed appropriate, department supervisors may want to review this information with their employees. ",Texas State University
23-Apr-20," Texas State University announces the Bobcat Cares program to provide funds directly to currently enrolled and eligible students with COVID-19 related expenses, emergency grants to all students enrolled in summer courses, pro-rated refunds of certain spring semester charges, and a new scholarship to cover fee and tuition costs for the fall 2020 semester.  

 The $30 million in student assistance includes over $15 million in federal emergency funding from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the CARES Act. The CARES allocation will help Texas State students deal with the financial burden caused by the COVID-19 crisis and assist with the costs of attending college by providing money directly to them.

For many of our students, the financial insecurity brought on by COVID-19 is an overwhelming burden, said Texas State University President Denise Trauth. I want to thank the members of our Texas Congressional delegation for their support of the CARES Act and the help it is providing our students. Our goal is to get this money to them as quickly as possible to help meet their immediate needs so they can focus on continuing their education at Texas State.

 Currently enrolled full-time and part-time students can apply to the university for funding to offset expenses incurred related to housing, food, and technology and course materials. Beginning April 27, students can complete a brief online application showing their need for the funds. The emergency grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, and the funding is not tied to existing financial aid programs such as the Pell grant. The money will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.

 In addition to the CARES Act funds, Texas State has identified $5 million to provide all students enrolled in funded courses during Summer I and/or Summer II classes a one-time emergency grant equal to $50 per credit hour up to $600 across both summer sessions. The grant funding will be in the form of a credit to student accounts to reduce the cost of summer courses.

 For students currently enrolled in the spring semester, the university is issuing more than $10 million in pro-rated refunds and credits for on-campus housing for those who moved from university residence halls to slow the spread of the coronavirus, parking fees, and dining. In addition, students employed through the Federal and State Work Study programs who have been unable to work onsite or remotely due to the COVID-19 situation will receive emergency grants.

 To support students enrolling in the fall 2020 semester, the university created the new Bobcats to Bobcats scholarship fund with a goal of providing $1 million to help students pay for tuition and fees as they continue their education.

I want our students and their families to know their safety is our top priority, and we are just as committed to helping them gain financial security in these very uncertain times. Texas State will do everything in our power to support our students during this difficult time so that they can continue to pursue the education and careers they desire, Trauth said.",Texas State University
24-Apr-20,"As we close the fourth week of remote instruction, I want to highlight the positive innovations that continue to result from Texas State Universitys strategic and values-based response to COVID-19.  Thank you for your significant commitment to ensuring a healthy and successful spring semester for all.

Bobcat Cares

 On Thursday, April 23, 2020, President Denise M. Trauth announced the launch of Bobcat Cares to help ease the financial strain many Texas State University students are experiencing.  This program provides funds directly to eligible students with COVID-19 related expenses, emergency grants to all 
students enrolled in summer courses, pro-rated refunds of certain spring semester charges, and a new scholarship to assist with fee and tuition costs for the fall 2020 semester.

 Students may apply for the Bobcat Cares funding beginning April 27, 2020.  The emergency grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19 and will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.

1-May-20," In preparation to resume in-person teaching for classes held during the second summer session beginning July 6 and the fall 2020 semester, Texas State University has established several pandemic and post-pandemic work groups to address areas related to safety, learning and university operations.

 During the current spring semester in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Texas State transitioned more than 5,200 courses to remote delivery on March 30, and approximately 5,000 students moved from the San Marcos Campus. The university has remained open with essential staffing through the spring semester, supporting students virtually and on campuses. More than 80 percent of faculty and staff are working remotely to sustain university operations.  Summer I classes (June 1-July 1) will continue to be delivered remotely with plans for students returning to the university on July 6 for the summer II session.

 As we anticipate returning to face-to-face instruction for summer II classes and the fall semester, we are working to adapt university operations to ensure we have a safe, healthy learning and working environment for our students, faculty and staff, said Texas State President Denise Trauth. When we return to in-person instruction, we are preparing to operate in a very different environment. I have established five work groups to create a university-wide plan that will drive the actions we will take to mitigate risks, deliver quality education, and protect our university community.

 In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, uncertainty abounds. Texas State University is committed to entering the unchartered waters wisely. Together, we have the knowledge, creativity, and ingenuity to face challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis and come out of this situation stronger and better than ever,  Trauth said.

Recommendations from the work groups will be reviewed by the Presidents Cabinet by June 15 with a university plan ready for implementation July 1.",Texas State University
1-May-20,"As we close the fifth week of remote instruction, I am reminded of how much has changed at Texas State University since mid-March 2020. Throughout it all, I have been inspired by the numerous displays of cooperation, transparency, and innovation as we swiftly adapted to the challenges of COVID-19.  Among other initiatives, the university continues to implement plans that bolster student success, enhance the teaching and learning environment, and prepare all of us for a resilient and safe future.

Bobcat Cares

As reported last week, the university launched the Bobcat Cares program to help ease the financial strain many Texas State University students are experiencing.

11-May-20,"Dear Bobcats,

 When the decision was made to move classes to remote delivery after spring break to protect our Texas State University community from the spread of the coronavirus, we also decided to postpone spring commencement to August 6 and 8, 2020, to coincide with August 7, 2020, summer ceremonies.

 The commencement feasibility work group, which included student representatives, faculty senators, a dean representative, the registrar, the commencement coordinator, the associate vice president for academic affairs, and the chief medical officer, has searched for the safest options to hold commencement events for more than 6,000 graduates and their families and friends over three days of ceremonies. After exhausting every possible scenario, we have made the hard decision that it will not be possible to hold in-person commencement ceremonies in August 2020 for spring and summer graduates while adhering to the required social distancing measures. Instead, we will share virtual commencement ceremonies on August 6, 7, and 8, 2020.

 As President, Commencement is my favorite time of year. Like many of you, I am disappointed that we cannot come together in person to celebrate this special occasion. However, I take comfort in knowing that we are doing the right thing to protect our Bobcat family and the greater San Marcos community.

 I know this may feel like a diminished experience, but by no means does it lessen the accomplishments of our graduates. Commencement is important because it is the ceremony to celebrate and formally recognize the degrees you have earned as graduates of Texas State University.  No matter what form commencement takes, those degrees are yours now, and for the rest of your lives.

 Planning is underway to ensure we have a very special experience to honor our graduates during a virtual commencement. We want to honor our brave students who persevered and graduated despite the disruption caused by the pandemic.

 To our graduates, I offer you a sincere and heartfelt congratulations. Your dedication and tenacity have shown the world what it means to be a Bobcat.

Sincerely,

Denise M. Trauth

18-May-20,"Dear Texas State University Community,

 In my May 1, 2020 email to the Texas State University community about our preparation to resume in-person teaching for summer II classes and the fall semester, I outlined several work groups established to create a plan that protects the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff as they return to live, learn, and work on our campuses.

 These work groups are comprised of more than 120 faculty, staff, and students representing a broad range of departments, expertise, professions, and voices. It is this diversity in thought and experience that will ensure our return to in-person instruction will address the safety and educational needs of our community. 

 I originally established five work groups, but that number has grown to eight to make our effort even more comprehensive. At the end of this email, you will find an explanation of each work group and a list of the members assigned to the group.

 The work group chairs will deliver preliminary recommendations to the Presidents Cabinet on May 22, 2020. Following that presentation, we will update the university community on their recommendations and lay out the process for implementing their recommendations. 

 There has never been a more serious charge for our Texas State community. I appreciate the diligence and dedication I have seen from the work groups as they approach this challenging task. Together, we will navigate the details of returning to classes and to our campuses with the upmost safety.

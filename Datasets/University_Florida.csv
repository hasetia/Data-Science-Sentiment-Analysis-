17-Apr-20,Florida,"APRIL 17: ACTING AND DECIDING IN UNCERTAIN TIMES
A column by UF President Kent Fuchs in The Independent Florida Alligator discussing planning and decision-making for the fall semester.

When facing a crisis, I suspect I have the same feelings and reactions as many others. I want to fix the problem and make decisions so I can plan ahead. 

What?s been so difficult about the ongoing pandemic is that its global and local uncertainties have largely prevented me from following my instincts. I?ve had to learn to make decisions that need to be made each day and then to plan for a variety of future scenarios. My inability to know and control the future is frustrating, but I know it must not stop me from acting on what must be done and decided each day.

With only two weeks left in the Spring semester, students and everyone in our university community are eager for information on what?s ahead. We have clarity about much of the Summer, but for the Fall we do not yet know how we will implement teaching, research, clinical and extension activity or even how we will enjoy our Gator football games.

Hundreds of talented individuals across the university are working to plan and prepare the campus for a variety of possible scenarios. They are working to both model and control the future.

I am optimistic that by the end of summer, there will be multiple breakthroughs in testing for the virus and antibodies, as well as advances in contact tracing. I?m also hopeful that supply-chain challenges will have been resolved.  I expect that during the summer, many of our faculty will return to their offices, libraries and laboratories, and our employees will gradually resume their normal work routines across the university.  

We expect that valuable information and breakthroughs will emerge in the month of May, enabling us to make important decisions in June and July about the Fall semester. We have a significant advantage over many universities with the presence of UF Health and our exceptional academic health center that are treating patients and conducting research. The Emerging Pathogens Institute is a national asset as its faculty model the pandemic and provides the insight necessary for therapies and vaccines.

As we learn more, we will coordinate closely with the State University System leadership and our elected leaders in determining the next steps. I anticipate we will announce a course of action for the Fall no later than July 15, and by then we will have clarity about major events such as August graduation ceremonies. 

I know many students are facing financial hardships due to the loss of jobs or other impacts of COVID-19 on them or their families. We learned last week the very good news that the federal government will provide $15.5 million to UF for direct aid to affected students. We are determining how to distribute these funds, with more information set to become available soon. This is in addition to the $1.8 million in emergency aid provided to students by donors and university relocations.

Finally, our work goes on. More will be accomplished at our university in the next two weeks than at any other time of the entire year. 

Thousands of papers, projects and exams will be completed, despite students and faculty abruptly having to transition to all-online classes last month. It will be a time of great stress, but also great joy, as students finish their classes and nearly 10,000 students earn their UF degrees.

I pray that all our students, faculty and staff will have the stamina and clarity to finish strong  and the continued resilience and optimism to succeed in the times ahead. 

Whether you are graduating, remaining at UF or moving on to new opportunities, I wish you the best for the summer and beyond. I very much look forward to seeing you when we meet again.

1-May-20,Florida,"MAY 1: NEXT STEPS FOR OUR UNIVERISTY 
Dear Colleagues,

As the spring semester nears its end, we would like to express our gratitude for all that you have done and continue to do in support of the University of Florida community.  While it will be some time until our campus returns to a more normal status, we will soon be taking the first steps in that direction, guided by the world-class physicians and epidemiologists at UF Health. 

Within guidelines set by local and state officials and the Florida Board of Governors, we expect to start bringing more faculty and staff back and opening up more parts of campus over the coming weeks. This transition will be conducted thoughtfully and carefully with the health and safety of returning faculty and staff being the top priority.  UF Health will monitor the process of reopening campus and today will announce a test-and-trace program aimed at identifying, isolating, and mitigating any campus incidence of COVID-19.

More guidance about this gradual return to campus will be forthcoming. 

You may have seen reports about Tuesday?s meeting of UF?s Board of Trustees in which we discussed financial impacts of the current crisis. We estimate that the university will see $42 million less revenue during the spring and summer semesters, with additional impacts being felt by our hospitals and other university entities. Those losses do not anticipate what might happen this fall, nor what might happen to our state appropriations if economic activity and sales tax revenues continue to decline.

As you would expect, the university is considering a variety of measures aimed at ensuring short- and long-term financial health, and we will keep you updated as decisions are reached.

This week, the trustees unanimously approved a retirement incentive for staff as one cost-saving measure, which will reintroduce for a brief time a sick leave payment for TEAMS staff with 10 or more years of service who retire on or before September 30, 2020, as long as they provide notice by June 30. UF Human Resources will share more details about the incentive plan soon.

Finally, we are focused intently on how the university will operate this fall. Our goals are to re-energize the research enterprise, to serve those students who need to be on campus to make appropriate academic progress and to have appropriate groups of faculty and staff return to campus under the advice and guidance of medical experts and in close coordination with the rest of the State University System. The Board of Trustees has approved moving the first day of instruction for the fall semester from August 24 to August 31 to provide more time for the campus to prepare for the return of students. This will not affect faculty appointments.

We expect to announce plans for the fall semester by mid-July. Planning efforts are guided by our recovery planning strategy, a multi-faceted model for aligning UF?s response to COVID-19-related challenges with its short- and long-term recovery needs. A task force of campus leaders charged with developing this framework includes representatives from UF Health, the President?s cabinet, campus academic leaders and others who will address these important issues. More information about our institutional planning can be found here: http://www.ufl.edu/health-updates/institutional-recovery-strategy/

In the weeks ahead, we expect that federal, state and local leaders will regularly update the guidelines under which we all operate. UF will develop, implement and continually refine our own health- and science-driven plans over the coming months to thoughtfully and gradually return to more normal campus activity within those government guidelines. 

Again, thank you for all that you are doing, and we pledge to regularly communicate with you as we advance the university?s plans for summer and fall.

1-May-20,Florida,"MAY 1: UF HEALTH TO PROVIDE CORONAVIRUS TEST-AND-TRACE PROGRAM TO HELP REOPEN UNIVERSITY 

View the video here: https://youtu.be/ZWh1UmhIEDc

University of Florida Health is rolling out plans for a rigorous ?test-and-trace? program to support the staged reopening of the UF, an expansive data-driven effort that will allow students, faculty and staff to return to campus as safely as possible while minimizing the risk of infection from the novel coronavirus.

The program builds on UF Health?s enormous expertise and capacity to combat the spread of the coronavirus, providing a pragmatic framework to guide decisionmaking and allow the university family to gradually return to campus with confidence.

UF Health infectious disease specialists point out that scientific evidence and modeling show that new infections can be controlled and reduced to manageable levels by expanded testing and then quickly isolating those who are infected by the coronavirus.

Teams of UF epidemiologists also will stand ready to immediately trace the contacts of any member of the university community who tests positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Testing will be conducted on these contacts, and they, too, will be isolated if they are found to carry the coronavirus.

UF Health is setting up what is essentially a free-standing public health disease surveillance unit operating in collaboration with and under the authority of the Florida Department of Health.

UF leaders say the approach guides decisions that will be grounded in science.

?We are following public health principles that have long proved to be effective in mitigating the spread of infectious disease,? said David Nelson, M.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health. ?We are not helpless in the face of the coronavirus. We can begin to return to our classrooms and our offices and our laboratories. But we need to do so smartly and with an eye toward protecting the most vulnerable among us.?

To that end, over the course of the next several months UF Health will be expanding testing to a wider array of people in the university community, including those who are asymptomatic but might be carriers of coronavirus, UF Health officials say, with more information to come soon.

A critical component of testing is the quick return of results, typically 12 hours or less for tests conducted and processed by UF Health. That allows for individuals who test positive to be quickly quarantined and their interactions with others investigated.

Contact tracing is a concept as old as the study of infectious disease. It involves some basic detective work and time-tested principles of epidemiology.

Students, faculty or staff who test positive for coronavirus will be interviewed by UF Health personnel trained in epidemiology or public health to identify as many of their recent contacts as possible. Roommates. Boyfriends or girlfriends. Acquaintances. The mechanic who fixed their car. A landlord who collected the rent. And so on.

One study shows that if 20% or more of the contacts of a symptomatic person are traced and put into quarantine, then an epidemic can be controlled and the chances of a ?second wave? can be reduced significantly.

?It is important to recognize that there isn?t a fire-breathing dragon in our front yard ready to devour us,? said Michael Lauzardo, M.D., deputy director of the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute and a specialist in infectious disease. ?Data are clearly showing, from a public health perspective, we need not stay in total lockdown. Test-and-trace will put the brakes on the inevitable spread of the virus.?

Not only will test-and-trace allow for the staged reopening of UF over the coming weeks, the data and experience can be a resource for the entire State University System.

At some point, antibody testing might also be of use to identify those who have already been exposed to the coronavirus. But antibody testing is not as simple as it sounds and there is still uncertainty about its usefulness, as there is reason to believe that just because someone has antibodies does not mean they cannot get or spread the infection again at some point in the future.

To be sure, as social distancing and stay-at-home orders are relaxed, there invariably will be an increase in cases of COVID-19. While the numbers of infected Floridians will decline as long as social distancing is in place, new cases will occur as those rules are relaxed. It is clear, said Lauzardo, the risk of infection will not entirely disappear.

Indeed, tighter social distancing might resume on campus if the number of coronavirus cases increases to a certain level.

A key to reopening UF is that UF Health Shands Hospital is well-positioned with supplies and patient capacity to treat anyone who requires hospitalization.

While few cases would be anticipated on campus with an aggressive test-and-trace program in place, it is important that the health system remain vigilant, health leaders say.

Numbers provide cause for optimism. In Florida, as of April 21, no Florida resident under the age of 25 has died from COVID-19.

University officials also are exploring options for the most vulnerable individuals to continue to social distance and have the option of working or taking classes online. That may include those over the age of 65 or anyone with underlying health conditions that make them particularly susceptible to a severe case of COVID-19, such as heart disease or diabetes.

?The goal of test and trace is not to prevent all cases of COVID on campus ? that is impossible ? but to slow the spread and to allow us to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the hospital and health care system from becoming overwhelmed,? said Lauzardo."

12-May-20,Florida,"MAY 12: REVISED TRAVEL POLICY 
On March 16, 2020, President Fuchs prohibited non-essential university travel. Travel that was deemed essential needed approval by a Senior Vice President or Vice President. Employees were strongly encouraged to minimize personal travel.

This memo modifies that policy as follows.

As UF reopens and reengages with other universities, industries, research and instructional initiatives, and governmental agencies, it is to be expected that members of the community will engage in additional travel closely tied to these activities. Consequently, essential travel directly connected to assigned university duties will be approved by the Dean of a College (or analogous Director in certain units), a Senior Vice President, or Vice President. At this time and until further notice, Deans and Directors may not delegate this responsibility to Department Chairs. No travel reimbursements will be issued without that approval.

Employees are still strongly encouraged to minimize personal travel.

Employees who do travel should inform themselves about restrictions and quarantines either in the areas to which they travel or requirements of the State of Florida and the University of Florida in returning from certain locations. UF may require returning employees to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning from certain destinations.

Employees are reminded that any international travel must be pre-approved by a Dean (or SVP or VP) and must be registered on the International Center International Travel Registration website https://internationalcenter.ufl.edu/travel/online-travel-registration. Employees are further reminded that they could find their movements severely restricted in international travel, including re-entry into the United States."
19-May-20,Florida,"MAY 19: RECOVERY TASK FORCES? WORK IS UNDERWAY 
From Joe Glover, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs; Charlie Lane, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Dear colleagues,

We would like to share with you some more information about the extensive planning underway to thoughtfully and carefully bring employees back to campus over the course of the next several weeks and join the amazing essential personnel who have worked to keep the university running.  There are several thousand employees who never left campus, but continue to support the university?s physical infrastructure and its functioning.  The university community owes a great debt to them, and we do want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and hard work. 

As we mentioned previously, our goals are to re-energize the research enterprise, to ensure that students can make appropriate academic progress and to have appropriate groups of faculty and staff return to campus under the advice and guidance of medical experts. 

As a key element of this planning process, we have created eleven task forces, each of which is charged with addressing an important aspect of our recovery. Each task force is chaired by UF leadership, and their membership includes medical experts, deans and members of the president?s cabinet.  They have been asked to return their preliminary findings and recommendations by June 1. 

The task forces? guiding issues, missions and names of task force chairs are as follows

UF Remaining Vital and Relevant in a Changing Higher Education Environment: How must the university adapt to a changed higher education terrain in the months and years ahead? What is the future of instruction and research, and how must we retool?

Consider social distancing standards, related policies, and consequences for not following these standards. Win Phillips, Executive Chief of Staff
Behavioral Expectations: Identify appropriate behavioral expectations of students and employees?both on and off campus?that will provide guidance to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. D?Andra Mull, Vice President for Student Affairs
Fall instruction: Develop a plan to deliver fall instruction so that students have the opportunity to make appropriate academic progress to graduation. Consider, in particular, how  to conduct experiential classes such as laboratories, music classes and clinical experiences. Andy McCollough, Associate Provost for Teaching and Technology
University Regulations and Policies: Review key university policies and regulations to assess whether or not we have the correct ones in place to address the new environment. Amy Hass, General Counsel
Supporting Managers: Managers may need to make difficult and unfamiliar decisions to deal with new situations. Consider how to provide orientation and support to managers in this new environment. Jodi Gentry, Vice President for Human Resources
Safe Practices on Campus: Consider how , UF can create a safe physical environment that allows for the practical re-population of its campus, both in and out of the classroom. Curtis Reynolds, Vice President for Business Affairs
Re-Institution of the Research Enterprise: Consider how to reintroduce faculty, staff, and students into their research settings and return the research enterprise to a stable state. David Norton, Vice President for Research
Communications Strategy: Consider the types of communication strategies that are needed to inform people regarding COVID-19-related concerns and that will create a new culture regarding health and safety norms. Nancy Paton, Vice President for Strategic Communications and Marketing
Financial Impacts: Provide a variety of analyses that will enable senior administration to make sound fiscal decisions concerning various financial impact scenarios. Joe Glover, Provost
The task force  reports will be used to guide the overall recovery plan going forward. We will make the reports available to you, and we welcome any suggestions you might have for making our plans stronger. Please direct your suggestions and ideas to the appropriate task force chair.

19-May-20,Florida,"MAY 19: STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT KENT FUCHS REGARDING FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS' ANNOUNCEMENT OF FALL REOPENING
?I embrace yesterday?s announcement from the Board of Governors that the University of Florida and the rest of the State University System will reopen in the fall. The blueprint and timeline from Board of Governors? chair Syd Kitson and State University System Chancellor Marshall Criser III fit perfectly with the work happening at the University of Florida, where the process of returning our employees to the workplace is already underway.

UF?s institutional recovery teams have been thoughtfully and carefully working out the details to welcome students back, with the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff at the forefront of every decision we make. Their work will form the backbone of the plan that we present to the Board of Governors on June 23, and that will enable students to return to UF.

Guided by the experts at UF Health, we are confident that we can implement smart, comprehensive practices that will enable a thriving, well-functioning campus and surrounding community this fall as the local, state, national and global COVID-19 situations continue to evolve. As our work to create a safer campus environment moves forward, we will keep in regular touch in the weeks ahead about the actions that all of us will be asked to take together as we prepare for August and beyond, and I am optimistic that my fellow Gators will once again rise to the challenge.?"

Information about the coronavirus
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Gina Fleming, MD, MSPH, Interim Associate Vice Chancellor Student Health and Wellness
January 24, 2020
Dear UC Santa Cruz community,
We know that many of you are concerned about the recent appearance of the coronavirus. Although there have been no confirmed cases on campus, we want to provide you with some information about how to protect your health.  
What is the Coronavirus?
Coronavirus is a group of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, including the common cold. According to the California Department of Public Health, the newest strain of coronavirus started in Wuhan, China. Most patients have had mild illnesses although a few are very sick or have died. As of this morning, two people have tested positive in the United States. No cases have been identified in California.
How is UCSC Student Health Services protecting the campus community?
At the Student Health Center, we check anyone with acute illness for their travel history and/or possible exposure to the virus. We also work closely with our local public health department and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). We follow their guidance about testing, treatment, and communications.
How can I stay healthy if I’m traveling?
CDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to Wuhan, China. Take the following precautions if traveling to other parts of China:
Avoid contact with sick people.
Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
If you traveled to China in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:
Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
Not travel while sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
To avoid sickness, we also recommend getting your flu shot and staying home when you’re sick. Take care of yourself with nutritious meals and plenty of sleep. ",Santa Cruz

January 30, 2020
UC Santa Cruz health officials are closely monitoring the coronavirus and, in coordination with county officials, preparing to manage any outbreaks in our campus community.
To date, there have not been any reported cases in Santa Cruz County or in the Bay Area. There have been two confirmed cases in Southern California, and four other cases in Washington, Arizona, and Illinois.
UC Santa Cruz has an information page online at ucsc.edu/coronavirus that will be updated regularly with new information. 
Coronavirus is group of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, including the common cold. According to the California Department of Public Health, the newest strain of coronavirus started in Wuhan, China.
State officials report that the immediate health risk from the coronavirus to the general public is low. Federal officials recommend that people avoid non-essential travel to China. 
As with any virus, especially during the flu season, the California Department of Public Health reminds people to: 
Wash hands with soap and water.


Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.


Avoid close contact with people who are sick are all ways to reduce the risk of infection with a number of different viruses.


Stay away from work, school or other people to avoid spreading illnesses. 


Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (cell phone, keyboard).


The potential threat of a novel virus can be frightening and overwhelming, with varying accounts and messages on social media and the internet.
Taking the outlined precautionary measures are the appropriate preventative measures in the event of any communicable disease. As a university, we stand to support, include, and protect our diverse and international community.
It is important to remember that isolating or assuming a certain racial group is carrying the disease is counterproductive and can cause unfounded suffering.
Campus community members who are experiencing discrimination or harassment on the basis of their nationality or race are encouraged to report incidents.

Updated directive on non-essential travel restrictions to CDC Level 2 and Level 3 Travel Health Notice countries
For UC Santa Cruz Community, effective February 3, 2020, updated on March 6 and March 26.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide information regarding restrictions of travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries. It provides guidance on the University of California’s Presidential Directive (1/30/2020) and a follow-up directives. President Napolitano issued a letter on March 5 further restricting international travel in accordance with recent CDC guidance. This directive expands the existing travel restriction for CDC Level 3 countries to include CDC Level 2 countries. University travel between these countries and UC Santa Cruz is prohibited without prior approval from campus Risk Services.
This remains a rapidly changing situation and any UC traveler to these regions should carefully evaluate the situation using guidance from the U.S. State Department and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as information provided by WorldAware, UC’s contracted global risk intelligence partner.
BACKGROUND
Following the United Nations’ World Health Organization’s declaration of the coronavirus outbreak in China as a “global health emergency” several federal and state agencies have issued travel advisories. 
In light of these actions, the University of California has restricted University-related travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries. These restrictions do not apply to travel that is solely personal; personal travelers should be aware of travel risks and of federal government warnings on any type of travel to/from CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries.
Members of the UCSC community may send questions regarding this procedure to oes@ucsc.edu, a dedicated email account that is monitored by the Office of Emergency Services.
APPROVAL PROCESS PRIOR TO TRAVEL
All UC-business travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries is restricted until further notice. This travel restriction is also applicable to “tack-on” travel. UCSC affiliates traveling for university business to other international locations shall not add add-on visits to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries.
To request approval for essential travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries (essential defined below), university business travelers must follow the applicable approval process as outlined below. Following this process and obtaining prior approval for essential travel will be required for reimbursement of travel expenses.
Faculty, Researchers, Postdoctoral Scholars: Essential travel is defined as travel that is required to:
preserve the safety of a research subject and which is not possible to be postponed; or
preserve the results of a research activity and which is not possible to be postponed.
For faculty, researchers, and postdoctoral scholars, essential travel does not include travel to attend professional or educational conferences. Conferences are just one example of non-essential travel – other activities will also be considered non-essential travel.
To request approval to engage in essential travel, employees in this group should contact their Dean in writing. If the Dean agrees that the proposed travel should be considered essential, the Dean will consult with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the Dean and AVC of Risk and Safety Services agree that the travel is essential, the Dean will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval.
Staff: Staff travel is considered non-essential.
To request an exception to the determination that UCSC-related travel to CDC Level 3 countries and CDC Level 2 countries is non-essential, the staff member should communicate in writing with their unit’s Principal Officer. The Principal Officer will then consult with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the travel is deemed essential, the Principal Officer will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval. The CP/EVC may consult with the AVC of Risk and Safety Services.
Students: Student essential travel is defined as that which is necessary to meet a graduation requirement and which is not possible to be postponed.
To request approval to engage in essential travel, students should contact in writing the Dean of their respective division. The Dean of the relevant division will confer with the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services. If the travel is deemed essential, the Dean will confer with the CP/EVC for final approval or disapproval. The CP/EVC may consult with the AVC of Risk and Safety Services.
Deans (of the disciplinary divisions, Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies) are responsible for ensuring that students are aware of this requirement, and Department Chairs and Institute/Organized Research Unit directors are responsible for ensuring that their faculty and researchers and their labs are aware of and adhere to this requirement.
If travel is approved and deemed essential, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their travel before their expected departure and update this information as changes occur, before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keep the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as the coronavirus.

2019 Novel Coronavirus
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Elizabeth Miller, D.O., Medical Director, UCSC Student Health Services
February 07, 2020
The potential threat of a new virus can be frightening and overwhelming, particularly with misinformation and rumors that can spread through our community and on the internet. This letter serves to update everyone with accurate information obtained from the CDC and state communicable disease specialists. 

UC Santa Cruz leaders remain in daily communication with health officials working for Santa Cruz County, the state, and the UC Office of the President. We have not had any confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases at UC Santa Cruz, and no confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County. However, there have been two confirmed cases in Santa Clara County and two cases in San Benito County. These four cases were placed in isolation immediately after arrival to the U.S., so the risk of spread of coronavirus from them has not been a concern. To date, California has had a total of six confirmed coronavirus cases, all doing well. 

UCSC Student Health Center leaders are committed to the health and wellness of the campus. We are prepared to support members of our campus community who may be impacted by the new coronavirus, including suspected or confirmed cases. We will continue to provide updates on coronavirus at ucsc.edu/coronavirus. Any significant changes to the situation will be shared immediately and broadly with our campus community. 

In accordance with the most recent public health guidance, anyone who has returned from China on or after Feb. 3, with or without symptoms of illness, should not go to work or school. They should go home and notify their health care provider. 

Persons who returned BEFORE February 3rd, and have been back for less than 14 days, and have become ill with fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their health care provider and be ready to share their travel history BEFORE arriving on site in order to make arrangements to prevent possible spread of illness to others. Students who become ill should contact the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 and ask to discuss their symptoms with a nurse. All students arriving for care at the Student Health Center are screened for their travel history and/or possible exposure to the virus. We do not have any suspected coronavirus cases at this time. UC employees can choose from a range of health care providers based on their health care plans. 

Faculty, staff and students who have returned from China BEFORE February 3rd and have no symptoms may wish to consider staying home for 14 days after they left mainland China, but it is not mandatory, and they should continue monitoring themselves for symptoms until the end of the 14 days.

As a university, we stand to support, include, and protect our diverse and international community. It is important to remember that isolating or assuming a certain racial group is carrying the disease is counterproductive and can cause unfounded suffering.

Campus community members who are experiencing discrimination or harassment on the basis of their nationality or race are encouraged to report incidents by going to help.ucsc.edu or reporthate.ucsc.edu.
We are, of course, in flu season and I encourage everyone in our community to take precautions to protect their health:

• Get a flu vaccine if you haven’t already done so.  SHS has several flu vaccine options for students. Please check the SHS website for more information.
• Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
• Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick

In addition, the CDC has listed other countries in both Asia and Europe where sustained transmission of COVID-19 has transpired or where the virus has spread. The health and well-being of our community remains our No. 1 priority. To that end, I think it is necessary for us to take all of the precautions necessary in this fluid situation, erring on the side of safety. Expanding on the directive I issued in late January, I am further directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice.

UC Santa Cruz is continuing to closely monitor the coronavirus (COVID–19) situation, and we are in regular contact with local and state health officials. We are also monitoring the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and relevant authorities closely. Clearly, the situation is changing daily, and we are prepared to take all proper precautions to protect our community and make sure everyone feels safe.
To date, there are no reported coronavirus cases at UC Santa Cruz or in Santa Cruz County. Three people at the UC Davis campus are currently in isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing one for COVID–19, while the other two are asymptomatic and, following CDC guidance, have not been tested.
For now, the most important thing is for you to do is stay home and seek medical care if you’re feeling sick, especially if you develop a cough or a high temperature. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831–459–2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment.
How UCSC is preparing
Student Health Center: The Student Health Center has partnered with the Santa Cruz County Health Department to receive information on any incoming travelers who have been advised to self-quarantine. The campus Office of Emergency Services has prepared a quarantine protocol for residential students who may require self-quarantine.
Containment: Students with respiratory symptoms and fever will be triaged in a separate area at Student Health Services. Any testing for COVID–19 will be coordinated with local public health officials.
Supplies: Cold and flu prevention packets that include tissues and hand sanitizer are being distributed at the Student Health Center and across campus.
Outreach and preparedness: The Student Health Center and the Office of Emergency Services are preparing outreach materials and sessions for personal and business continuity preparedness. Town halls and presentation dates will be released in the coming week.
Quarantine space: For residential students unable to go home who have been advised by public health to self-quarantine for 14 days, the university has established quarters. Individuals under self-quarantine will be provided with a private bedroom, phone-in wellness checks from medical professionals, and meal deliveries.
Prevention: Campus is preparing to distribute additional hand-sanitizing stations at numerous buildings. Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.
Academic support: Campus is exploring options for delivering education via alternative platforms to allow anyone who is ill or in self-quarantine to compete coursework remotely.
Education abroad programs: To ensure the safety of our students and faculty, the university is closely monitoring all U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control travel advisories. Programs may be postponed, cancelled, or delivered in alternative formats.
Help stop the spread: Share the facts about COVID–19 prevention and symptoms. Faculty and staff, please print and post CDC bulletins in your academic and administrative buildings.
International travel restrictions
This week, the Centers for Disease Control has added a Level 3 Travel Notice for South Korea, Italy, and Iran to the existing Level 3 Travel Notice for China. For the health and well-being of the UC community, President Janet Napolitano has expanded the UC Travel Directive to temporarily avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice. For the latest on travel warnings and UC-related updates, visit ucal.us/coronavirus.
UCSC is following CDC guidelines for decisions about travel and programming abroad.
UCSC considers any country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Advisory, “Avoid Nonessential Travel,” an elevated-risk destination. University-related student travel to those countries will be prohibited, and staff and faculty must request campus approval prior to travel.
For any country with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Advisory, “Practice Enhanced Precautions,” UCSC will alert students in the country and advocate for adoption of enhanced infection-control precautions. University-run programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine an appropriate course of action.
Spring break
COVID–19 is present in a number of countries. Students, faculty, and staff making spring break travel plans should visit the US State Department Travel Advisories and CDC “Coronavirus 2019 Information for Travel” websites for up-to-date travel advisories.
Planning for summer travel abroad
Although we do not know whether the Level 3 Travel Health Advisories for China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran will remain in place over the summer, we strongly suggest UCSC students, faculty, or staff planning to participate in or lead organized programs of study, work or research in those countries this summer make alternate plans. We are examining contingency plans for students who might be required to stay on campus this summer including meaningful programming opportunities and housing.
Updates on COVID–19
As of Feb. 28, there are a total of 34 positive cases in California: 24 are from repatriation flights. The other 10 confirmed cases include seven that are travel-related, one due to person-to-person exposure from a very close contact (a spouse) and two from unknown sources. These numbers align with the CDC. Approximately 200 people have been tested to date.
The health risk from novel coronavirus to the general public remains low at this time, according to state health officials. While COVID–19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate. From the international data the state has, of those who have tested positive for COVID–19, approximately 80 percent do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization. There have been no confirmed deaths related to COVID–19 in the United States. The state is assessing the situation as it evolves.
Academic impact and support
While health and safety are our primary concerns, we remain mindful of the academic challenges students face as more travel destinations and study-abroad programs are affected by the spread of the virus. Academic units are encouraged to make their best efforts to support students whose quarters may be disrupted due to coronavirus concerns so that they can complete their coursework.
We also are aware that staff, post-doctoral fellows and faculty may find their work disrupted due to travel restrictions, and we urge supervisors to be flexible and generous in establishing alternative responsibilities.
Prevention and protection
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners also are effective.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue away.
Put used tissues in the trash immediately.
Avoid close contact with sick people.

As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread, we are doing everything possible to protect the health of our students, faculty, and staff. The safety and well-being of our community is our number one priority. Campus experts have been communicating often and broadly about ways that the community can take precautions (see the most recent update here). We are also preparing for potential situations in which members of our campus community become ill or need to be placed in isolation or quarantine. We remain committed to ensuring that our students continue to receive a top-quality education, along with support services and extracurricular experiences, while protecting the health of our faculty, staff, and students. 
We write to share best practices for instructors and academic units, for the educational benefit of our students. The goal of this preparation and planning is to minimize educational impacts should participation in coursework become difficult for health reasons for academic staff or students. If you encounter challenges, please consult with your department/program chair or college provost. Units should work closely with their dean’s office.
The CDC recommends that anyone who is sick not attend class in person. As such, instructors should consider how to accommodate students who may not be able to attend class in person, due to illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions: 
If feasible, arrange for lecture capture/webcasting of your course. 


Consider alternatives for instruction and student engagement (such as Zoom) that allow remote participation and assessment, including pre-recording lectures that can be accessed in the event the class cannot meet interactively. We acknowledge that this is not possible for some classes, such as studio or lab classes.


We strongly recommend adjusting course policies related to class and examination attendance so as not to penalize students who become ill or are placed under quarantine. Inflexibility regarding attendance will increase the chances of others in the class and on campus being infected.


For assistance with the items involving educational technology, please contact the Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC). The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL) has posted a resource folder for instructors relevant to teaching during unplanned events/maintaining educational continuity, including modifications to design and delivery of courses. 
Instructors are encouraged to make class resources available to their department or course sponsoring agency, in case they are physically unable to continue teaching due to illness or quarantine.
Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook, either in the Canvas learning management system or through another mechanism that provides access to department staff, so that if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are under quarantine, there is an up-to-date record of coursework.


Consider establishing a plan for submission and grading of final exams and papers, and for the submission of course grades, should the instructor or other course staff be unable to work if ill or quarantined.


Publish all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, reading lists) on Canvas, so that students can access them remotely even if unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine. Alternatively, if the course has a separate website or other online resources, provide a link to it from Canvas, and ensure that your department can get access to it in case you are unable to continue instruction. If you are using Google Drive to store your course documents, consider giving your departmental staff and Chair access to your drive.


Give your department access to webcasts of course lectures, particularly for regularly taught courses, so that these can be used in instances where an instructor is unable to deliver lectures.


Academic administrators (deans, chairs, directors, and provosts) are encouraged to make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined.  
Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or students who had arranged for accommodation. The Disability Resource Center is available to answer instructor questions regarding continuing to provide accommodations to students who qualify for them. 


Discuss these issues and approaches with the faculty in your unit, and work with each to develop plans for academic resilience by taking the steps outlined above or through other approaches.


Work with Summer Session to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support the academic advancement of students from abroad who cannot go home during summer 2020. 


Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already. Make faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed to support current courses.


Help arrange for key courses to undergo lecture capture in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, and beyond, so as to provide the greatest coverage in future times of need. 


Thank you for taking steps to ensure the educational resilience of our campus and to support our students’ academic success in the face of the challenges posed by COVID-19.
We understand that this is a stressful time for students and faculty alike. We are here to support you as we navigate this situation together. If you need further assistance or have ideas to strengthen our educational resilience protocols, please reach out any time.",Santa Cruz

UC Santa Cruz leaders continue to closely monitor the dynamic COVID-19 (coronavirus) situation and are in regular communication with local and state health officials. Your health and wellbeing are our number one priority and we are doing all we can to support a safe and healthy environment for everyone in our campus community. This update provides information on preparedness activities and recent changes to travel restrictions, which are particularly important in consideration of the upcoming spring break. This information, along with additional guidance and resources, can be found on the UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 (coronavirus) web page.
Preparedness and Prevention
To date, no one in Santa Cruz County or at UC Santa Cruz has tested positive for COVID-19. 
I do want the campus to be aware that earlier this week we learned that two staff members with the Genomics Institute were at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) offices in Redwood City on February 27 and may have been exposed to COVID-19 through a contract worker on the Redwood City CZI site that day. That contract worker has now tested positive for COVID-19, but analysis has determined that neither of the two Genomics Institute staff are among the seven individuals who had close enough contact with the infected contract worker for direct transmission of the virus.
Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, both UCSC employees have self-quarantined and are pursuing options for testing. We continue to believe that there is minimal risk to our employees.
Separately, one student receiving medical care off campus was tested on March 4 for COVID-19 after experiencing respiratory symptoms. That test came back negative on March 5. Out of an abundance of caution, UC Santa Cruz moved the student’s two roommates into quarantine housing after learning about the testing. With the negative test result, those two students have returned to their on-campus residence.
For now, the most important thing for you to do is stay home, rest and avoid contact with others if you are not feeling well. You should call your medical provider if you develop a cough, difficulty breathing, or a fever. Anyone with these symptoms AND recent travel to China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, or Japan should call their healthcare provider in advance and make arrangements to be evaluated. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment. Please visit the Student Health Center website for general health information.
Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.
Travel Restrictions and Registration
President Napolitano issued a letter on March 5 further restricting international travel in accordance with recent CDC guidance. This directive expands the existing travel restriction for CDC Level 3 countries (China, South Korea, Italy, Iran) to include CDC Level 2 countries (Japan). University travel between these countries and UC Santa Cruz is prohibited without prior approval from campus Risk Services.
Any travelers from a CDC Level 3 country, whether traveling for university or personal reasons, must self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. The UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services will assist with quarantine logistics for any on-campus residents and serve as a point of contact for those quarantining off campus. 
All international university travel must be registered in one of two ways:
Use the Connexxus system to make reservations. This will automatically add your travel to the travel registry.


If you do not use Connexxus for reservations, register your travel through the UC Away system. 


If you are planning to travel for spring break, check the CDC and State Department travel advisories prior to departure. If you travel to a CDC Level 3 country, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. Before returning to campus, undergraduate residential students who have recently traveled to these regions should contact their college’s senior director in order to identify an appropriate quarantine facility. Because of the restrictions on returning to the US, and the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation, international travel is not advised.
Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency Update
Santa Cruz County Health Services, in coordination with the California Department of Public Health, is the lead agency for ensuring an effective communitywide response. The campus will follow guidance from Santa Cruz County and the California Department of Public Health with respect to cancellation of group events or classes. At this time, given the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in Santa Cruz County, UC Santa Cruz is not planning to cancel classes or suspend or modify operations. 
In an effort to secure more support and resources in managing any potential coronavirus cases, the county Health Services Agency declared a local health emergency.
According to the county, the declaration will empower it to:
More effectively respond to COVID-19,


Seek and utilize mutual aid,


Potentially obtain reimbursement, and


Ensure that the county’s health professionals and other local stakeholders have all the necessary tools and powers at their disposal.


Support Resources
This continues to be a rapidly changing situation. No doubt, some of you may be feeling anxious and concerned. Students in need of support can reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services. For faculty and staff, the Employee Assistance Program can provide personal counseling and support.
We are closely following the guidance of our state and nation's top health leaders to ensure our response will support the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.

Over the past few weeks, we have all learned of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID–19) to locations around the globe, various cities in the US, and in neighboring counties. Santa Cruz County learned of its first confirmed case of COVID–19 on Saturday, March 7; this person is not affiliated with the UCSC campus. We expect that the number of confirmed cases will continue to climb with more widespread testing. Understandably, this possibility leads to elevated worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in higher-risk populations.
I want to acknowledge the uncertainty, concern and worry that this virus and its consequences have created for so many in our community. Though there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus, the first confirmed case could very well happen on campus at any time. We want to be as prepared as possible so we can move quickly should we need to.
Campus Status
The campus continues to remain open and operational. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID–19 have been reported at UCSC, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully as we assess the local impact. After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low for our campus. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend normal instructional activity.
To ensure that we are prepared, I am calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that we will need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually in the near future.
You may have seen the memo to instructors advising that they begin planning ways to offer course content and lectures outside of the classroom and predominantly online. To this point, the appropriate Academic Senate committees (Committee on Educational Policy, Committee on Courses of Instruction, and Graduate Council) agree that instructors may switch to Zoom-only with approval of the department chair (or equivalent head of the course sponsoring agency). Where practical, supervisors and managers may allow employees to work remotely. These are measures we can scale up quickly and broadly across campus.
We are aware that a small number of other universities, with different local circumstances, have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our local situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the local health officials and UC Office of the President. While we are not ending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we do understand the value of increased “social distancing” as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus. If the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings.
Should UCSC need to move to a hybrid or completely virtual instruction model, on-campus housing will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases within on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials should it become necessary. Dining services will also continue to serve students with meal plans.
This situation is fluid, and it could change very quickly in the Santa Cruz area, requiring that we change course at a moment’s notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on our COVID–19 webpage or the Office of the President’s COVID–19 webpage.
Travel Considerations
The University of California revised its instructions on travel on March 5th and further restrictions are anticipated as additional cases of COVID–19 are confirmed. Please consider the potential for additional countries to be added to the restricted travel list which could result in difficulties getting back into the US. Travelers should be prepared or arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return from a restricted jurisdiction or if you are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID–19. Consult our COVID–19 webpage for the most up-to-date information on travel advice.
Your Health and Wellness
Finally and most importantly, it is crucial for all members of the UC Santa Cruz community to heed the recommendations for preventative care which have the greatest likelihood of protecting us as individuals, as well as the larger community, by diminishing the chances of transmission of the virus:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, or, as an alternative, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Stay home if you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands.
In addition, it is recommended that people practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu.
Thank you for doing your part to protect our community. Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.",Santa Cruz

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
As outlined in a previous campus communication, UCSC is continuing to take precautionary steps to prepare the campus for scenarios where COVID-19 makes large gatherings unsafe. As a result, we are advising instructors to prepare for the possible suspension of Winter quarter in-person instruction and in-person finals. Many instructors have already been using tools such as webcasting, Zoom, and Canvas to deliver instruction, and we ask those instructors who have not been doing so to consider how you might modify instruction in the event that classes can no longer meet in person. Comprehensive information is available listing campus technological solutions and adaptations for instruction.
Final Exams

For Winter 2020, all instructors should prepare now for at least some students to be unable to attend the final exam in person. The health and safety of our community is our top priority, and we need to ensure that a sick student does not feel compelled to come to campus, which could pose a significant public health risk.

In addition, instructors should have a contingency plan in place should Winter quarter in-person final exams be suspended altogether.

Here are some principles to help guide instructors:
The recent Senate guidance on changes to a syllabus recommends that “when making adjustments, faculty should make every effort to teach in a way that continues to support students in achieving the learning goals of the course, even as we recognize that some course elements may need to change due to extreme unplanned events such as campus closures.”
Focus on learning rather than testing. The priority in an emergency is not to replicate traditional in-person tests but to provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate and solidify their learning.
Options to demonstrate learning in lieu of traditional exams might include online exams (administered through Canvas), other forms of take home exams, project based learning, short student-made videos expressing learning (where appropriate), and a range of other alternative assessments.
Online proctoring may be available by request. Please email online@ucsc.edu for more details. Due to high demand for this service among institutions around the country, the availability of online proctoring is limited, but UCSC will continue to work to make it available to interested instructors. Arrangements typically need to be made at least a week in advance. Campus resources may be available to cover the per-student costs. This will be discussed when contact is made with online@ucsc.edu.
If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student’s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete. Instructors should be clear as to what needs to be done within the next quarter.
For take-home examinations and papers, rather than trying to eliminate cheating in at home environments, you may want to try the alternative of offering a different style of assessment and messaging about academic integrity. Cheating is extremely difficult to eliminate. In-person exams do not always translate directly into remote environments. Designing assessments that make it difficult for students to cheat may be more practical than trying to stop cheating. For instance, open book exams that are time limited may make it less likely that students will cheat. Timed exams through Canvas or email that are sent out and returned at a specific time make it difficult for students to consult a lot of outside sources. Canvas can allow an instructor to restrict the IP address of the user. Finally, Canvas allows the use of quiz banks, so that questions can be shuffled, making it difficult for students to reliably collaborate, especially in timed environments.
Remember that students who have DRC accommodations will still need reasonable accommodations in alternative teaching and assessment environments. Consult directly with the DRC if you have questions about accommodations.
Have a plan in place and discuss it with your students in the days prior to the exam if at all possible. “If campus is operating as normal, then X. If you are sick and unable to attend an in-person exam, then Y. If in-person final exams are cancelled, then Z.” Talk to students about how you may have to modify your original grading plan. Be transparent about what that will look like.
The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning and ITS have posted instructions and suggestions for instructors who need to modify examinations, assessments, and feedback and/or use technology for instruction due to present circumstances. Additional online resources have just been developed for instructional resilience during the COVID 19 outbreak (and other unplanned events). CITL, FITC, and Online Education staff will be available in the coming days to consult individually with instructors both about finishing Winter 2020 courses and planning for possible contingencies in Spring. An email to citl@ucsc.edu, fitc@ucsc.edu, or online@ucsc.edu will connect you with staff, who will route your question to the appropriate person in their own or another unit.
Remember that some students may not have access to a computer or to high-speed internet at home. If in-person classes are suspended, instructors should not require students to come to campus to access the internet or other facilities. Instructors should consider if there are ways to allow students to complete assignments without internet access, such as having students do some forms of work and take a picture with their phones, sending it in on the cellular network. Note: for proctored online examinations, high-speed internet access is essential.

Good communication is key
It is important to recognize that many students have significant anxiety around assessment and that all students are likely to be experiencing higher than normal levels of stress associated with the strike/protest and COVID-19. Clear and positive communication with students about the event and how you will handle assessments can help alleviate anxiety.
Avoid changing the format of the assessment multiple times if possible. If you need to change the format or date, be transparent about why and what information you are using to make the decision and when you plan to let students know the plan. Acknowledge that the situation may be less than ideal but that you are focused on providing the best learning experience possible under the circumstances.
Keep any Teaching Assistants, Readers, or other instructional staff apprised of planned changes. Communicate your expectations and clarify their roles.
If able, you might ask students for their feedback about possible alternatives for assessment. Giving students the chance to weigh in on these decisions can help them feel more in control of the situation.
Unplanned events can make assessment of student work challenging. Maintaining a focus on learning outcomes can make decisions about what mode of assessment to use clearer. And finally, good communication with students throughout is essential to help alleviate stress and help students maintain focus on their learning in the face of uncertainty.

Thank you for your assistance in this dynamic environment. We appreciate your diligence as we all work together to ensure our campus is prepared and safe.

URGENT: UC Santa Cruz suspending in-person classes in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
Today we are implementing new campus actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. Importantly, there are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time; however, we recently learned that a second case has been identified in Santa Cruz County and the number of cases in neighboring Santa Clara County continues to rise. As local, national, and global public health recommendations increasingly shift to efforts to mitigate transmission by social distancing, UC Santa Cruz is proactively taking steps to protect our campus community.

In our assessment of the current situation, we believe that this is the best action for our campus and the broader Santa Cruz community. These measures are effective beginning Wednesday, March 11, and will remain in place through the first week of the spring quarter. A decision on what will happen after April 3 and beyond for the spring quarter will occur at a later date, based on the latest coronavirus information available. Timely updates will be emailed and posted on the UCSC COVID-19 website.

INSTRUCTION
Beginning Wednesday, March 11, lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminars will be offered through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom) to reduce face-to-face interactions as much as possible.
Lab and studio courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate can continue to meet in person where necessary. 
In-person winter quarter final exams will be conducted via alternate means - not in person. Instructors will be communicating with their students this week about alternative plans for assessment on a course-by-course basis.
The first week of spring quarter, Monday, March 30, though Friday, April 3, will also follow this model with lecture courses and discussion sections delivered remotely.
EVENTS
Per CDC guidance, crowds should be avoided. As such, all campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 50 attendees (based on county guidance) will be canceled or postponed. These include events put on by the administration or academic departments and scheduled to take place through Friday, April 3. Further guidance will be forthcoming regarding student organization events.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
CAMPUS OPERATIONS

The campus is not closing. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations, including student housing and dining, health services and research support operations, will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified as conditions change.

While the campus will remain open, we encourage all students who are able to do so return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. We know this is not possible for all students, however reducing the number of people on campus will increase the safety of all, and allow those who remain on campus to better practice social distancing. Additional guidance about the spring quarter will be provided prior to April 3 based on the latest available coronavirus information.

Some limitations in operations and services may arise as managers may be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided shortly. In addition, a message outlining additional adjustments to campus operations, events and travel will be issued shortly.

We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice may be challenging and disruptive, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. The safety of our campus community is our highest priority. We are grateful to the community members throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles.

We will continue to update you on this issue with the latest information on our COVID-19 webpage or the Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage.

Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your families and any concerned parties.",Santa Cruz

Earlier today, the Chancellor announced new actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. In recent days we have seen the continued spread of COVID-19 around the world and now here in Santa Cruz County. We can expect that confirmed cases will continue to grow in our region and in our campus community. There are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time.
The public health guidance we are receiving continues to emphasize not only good personal hygiene practices, but also minimizing close contact among groups of people, as means of restraining the spread of COVID-19. We are placing constraints on large public events at UC Santa Cruz, and now we are taking steps regarding course instruction.
For the final three (3) days of the winter quarter, beginning Wednesday March 11, through the first week of spring quarter, Friday April 3, we will be suspending most in-person classes and will be offering all lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminar instruction through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom). Wherever possible, instruction should be carried out through Zoom meetings. In addition, instructors should provide assigned course materials, including the instructor’s lecture materials, on Canvas.
During this period laboratory and studio classes can continue to meet in person where necessary. We do encourage, for these courses, minimizing in-person meetings as appropriate and whenever possible. 
To the fullest extent possible, final exams will be moving to remote instruction formats. Alternative arrangements must be made for any Winter quarter final exams that were scheduled to be administered in person, such as delivering via a remote format, restructuring as a take-home exam, or replacing with a final project.  
We recognize that this is a significant adjustment for instructors, staff, and students. Departments and instructors should work together to determine the most appropriate solutions for finishing courses and assigning grades. The March 9 message to instructors provides guidance on online instruction and assessment, and instructors are strongly encouraged to provide students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge at the end of the quarter. Above all, departments and faculty are asked to put student health and success first in their decision making. In that spirit, advising, tutoring, and supplemental instruction should move to Zoom format to the fullest extent possible.
For final exams and end-of-quarter assessment of student performance, instructors may also need to consider options such as: electronic submission of final papers, projects, and take-home examinations; and proctored online examinations.
If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student’s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete. Instructors should be clear as to what needs to be done within the next quarter to remove the incomplete. The March 6 Academic Senate message noted that instructors may not be able to satisfy all the learning outcomes of their course, and that student assessment may not be in accordance with the grading plan laid out in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. If necessary, faculty should consult with their department chairs in determining the most appropriate actions to take. 
We are committed to providing support to help instructors in this effort. Please consult the March 9 message to instructors for specific information about available resources for remote instruction and final exams. We encourage all instructors to email students in their courses immediately to let them know their course plans. 
As instructors plan for Spring quarter, course materials of all types should be placed on Canvas. Laboratory and studio courses for which remote instruction is not possible can meet in person, although we continue to advise minimizing in-person meetings. More guidance on Spring quarter teaching will be provided as soon as possible.
In closing, we thank you for all that you are doing to support our campus community—and especially our students—during this challenging period. Thank you, all, for your commitment to the well-being of our community.",Santa Cruz

To: UC Santa Cruz campus community
From: Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services

As outlined earlier this morning by Chancellor Larive, UC Santa Cruz is making adjustments to the delivery of classes and the administration of final exams in response to the COVID-19 virus. While we do not have a confirmed case on campus, there are confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County, and we are working to be proactive in supporting the health and safety of our campus community.

In addition to the adjustments in instruction and final-exam administration, and consistent with consultation with our campus emergency management experts, we are making the following adjustments and recommendations related to campus operations. This guidance applies to all campus locations. There could be additional guidance that applies to locations outside of Santa Cruz County should local circumstances warrant it. Note that this guidance is based on the situation as we know it today. Some recommendations may adjust as conditions change. Continue to check for online updates. In addition, questions can be sent to publicaffairs@ucsc.edu. Finally, we will be hosting online town halls to provide further guidance and answer questions you might have about the campus response. Information about those online town halls will be forthcoming.

Sanitation
We are proactively implementing a plan to provide a higher level of sanitation for campus public areas such as building entries, lobbies, restrooms, classrooms, teaching laboratories, libraries, dining halls and other spaces where a large number of people are present or pass through daily. In addition, we are working to expand the locations and number of hand-sanitizing stations across campus. We are also expanding educational information posted across campus outlining the actions all members of the community can take to promote sanitary environments.

Telecommuting
Where feasible, and until at least April 3, supervisors and managers should encourage telecommuting. For positions where telecommuting is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family. To ensure staff do not feel compelled to come to work while ill due to a concern about a lack of sick leave balance, UC has issued new guidance on paid leave and remote working provisions. This guidance can be found online.

Travel
Effective immediately, we are recommending the following adjustments to campus travel taking place through April 3. These changes may be expanded beyond that date should conditions warrant.

All non-essential business-related staff and faculty travel that is scheduled to take place prior to April 3 should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.

Those who are overseeing university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancelation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, modality of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.

In Chancellor Larive’s message, she suggested students who are able to should return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. Students unable to travel or return home during this time due to conditions in their destination or due to other health considerations where travel poses a risk may remain on campus. There will be dining options available, though some services might be adapted as conditions change.

In addition to the travel guidance outlined here, the previously communicated travel directives outlined by the UC Office of the President remain in effect.

Events taking place on campus or sponsored by campus
For all events scheduled to take place prior to April 3, we recommend the following:
Cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance over 50. This number is consistent with guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host.
For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.
Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.
Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled. Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from Chancellor Larive and iCPEVC Kletzer.
This event guidance could be extended past April 3 if conditions warrant. In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled for March and April where event characteristics match those outlined above.

Campus meetings
Where possible, campus departments should utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel on campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancelations.

Research business continuity
Principal officers should ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations. The Office of Research has been working to support this and is engaged with researchers to assist in this effort.

In addition to the items outlined above, our campus emergency response team, in partnership with units across campus, continues to work daily to ensure our response plans are robust in the event we have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on campus or face escalation of illness in our city and county. Our primary focus is ensuring we can support the health and safety of our campus community.

Thank you for your support as we undertake these operational changes.",Santa Cruz

COVID-19 Guidance for supervisors and managers

Working during this unusual time in response to the COVID–19 emergency requires flexibility and modifications to our normal practices. This message addresses several temporary changes we are making to our regular human resources policies to ensure we are maximizing the safety of our community members while continuing to deliver on our educational and research mission.
Principal officers have been asked to provide guidance to their teams that is in alignment with the functions of their respective divisions. Our campus is also following system-wide guidance from the Office of the President (OP) (Guidance from OP) that is described below.
We need to maintain many regular operations while much of our instruction is being transitioned to an online format. Your support is critical to providing increased “social distancing” and other healthy practices. Modifications to an employee’s regular work location, assignments, and schedule should be considered on a case by case basis by the responsible manager.
These five (5) important temporary system-wide emergency provisions now apply at our campus until further notice:
Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID–19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible, as determined by the supervisor. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID–19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.
Managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave. Managers may determine which positions to designate, provided that all healthcare workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.
Academic appointees who do not accrue sick leave but who are eligible for paid medical leave under APM 710–11 or a collective bargaining agreement may request medical leave for their own illness. For other COVID–19 related absences and for those who have exhausted medical leave options, appointees will receive up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave. Requests for medical leave and administrative leave should be directed to the Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator.
Implementing these five (5) provisions requires managerial judgment, discretion and flexibility depending on the unit’s functional priorities and often based on factors present in a specific case.
We encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all employees, including student employees, in caring for their health – and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID–19 – while enabling them to continue performing their important work. Our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to work on site.
In situations where work can temporarily be performed from home or an alternate location, we encourage managers and employees to work together to identify opportunities to allow employees to work remotely. For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented, and student workers), managers and employees should work together to develop a remote work plan to complete special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training. In developing a remote work plan, managers should be mindful of employees who may need alternate work stations set up.
Student employees are not eligible for FMLA. However, student employees are eligible for the fourteen (14) days of administrative leave if they cannot work remotely, self isolate or are exhibiting symptoms of the COVID–19.
Regarding travel, please be conservative in determining travel that is required. It is better to avoid travel than it is to travel. Many UC systemwide meetings are now being canceled or changed to Zoom in order to decrease the need for business travel. Please do not let concerns about non-refundable deposits, etc. lead to travel decisions that put people in more susceptible situations.
Please continue to provide the empathy and patience needed to deal with staff who express concerns. Also, find ways to thank those who have roles requiring them to work onsite. The campus is not closed. We still have people who live on campus, need to deal with facility issues, need to maintain labs and conduct research, and a variety of other duties.
Subject to the needs of the University, managers should consider flexible work arrangements such as having employees work on-site with reduced shifts (fewer hours or fewer days). This can be coupled with remote work assignments for the time not spent on-site.
We appreciate the consideration that has been demonstrated by our community as we continue to work through this unpredictable situation. Campus and UC leaders are continuing to meet daily to think through these issues and are preparing to take the necessary measures to protect the health of our employees. Please contact your Employee Relations Analyst in SHR or your Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator for guidance or questions about these topics.

I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections is now extended to the full spring quarter. We also will continue with remote final exams at the end of spring quarter, June 8-12.
Since I last wrote to you on Tuesday, additional information has emerged about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its rapid spread. It is a crisis of enormous scale and human impact, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We made this difficult decision to extend remote instruction following consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.
This does not mean campus is closing for spring quarter. Campus will remain open. Most support services for students, including counseling, advising, and tutoring, will be delivered via Zoom. Over the next two weeks, departments and instructors will evaluate the extent to which laboratory and studio courses can be offered in person with appropriate social distancing or whether they can transition to remote instruction. Additional guidance will be provided about these courses by March 20, and no in-person laboratory or studio courses will meet prior to April 6.
Students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through the spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Student housing, dining, health services, the library, and research support operations will remain open, although there will be changes in most operations and services. 
Should you wish to cancel your housing for the entire spring quarter, you can complete the online Intent to Vacate form. (A link to the form will be emailed to residential students soon). If you remove all of your belongings from your housing and return your key by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee.
New details about this virus are emerging constantly, and we are updating our campus COVD-19 website regularly. The site includes sections on Health Services, Instruction, Campus Operations, Telecommuting, Events, Student Services, Travel, and International Studies. Please use the site as a resource about the virus and how to protect yourself against it. It is also where you will find all of the latest information on how our campus is responding to the outbreak. The UC Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage is also a good resource.
I know the measures we have taken are difficult, especially for students. I regret that this period in your lives is being filled with so much uncertainty. Our highest priority must be to keep everyone on our campus safe. 
To our faculty and staff, I thank you for your flexibility and willingness to roll up your sleeves as we do our best for our students. You are doing extremely valuable work while undoubtedly also experiencing your own anxiety. Though we do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on our campus, there are currently seven confirmed cases in the county, and it was announced last night that all Santa Cruz County public schools will shut down next week, March 16-20. I understand the stress this puts on many of you. 
At the same time, I am confident that together we will reach the other side of this upheaval, and I look forward to the time when our community will again be able to come together in person. The preventative measures being taken by universities, by cities and counties, and by the business community are critical to successfully confronting this health emergency. Our best course of action is to undertake aggressive public measures to slow the spread of the virus. The steps we are taking at UCSC are intended to do just that.",Santa Cruz

As outlined earlier today by Chancellor Larive, remote instruction for lecture and discussion sections, originally announced through April 3, will extend for the entire spring quarter.
Even with the remote instruction, the campus remains open. Though the campus will remain open through spring quarter, a variety of services have been or will be adjusted to promote social distancing to protect the health and safety of the campus community. As of this morning, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases on our campus; however, there are now seven confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and 66 in neighboring Santa Clara County. The proximity of cases around us means we must remain vigilant. 
In addition to the extension of remote instruction through spring quarter, we are making additional adjustments and recommendations regarding campus operations. Many of the operational changes outlined March 10 are now being expanded. The changes are detailed below. This guidance applies to all campus locations. There could be additional guidance that applies to campus locations outside of Santa Cruz County should local circumstances warrant. Note that this guidance is based on the situation as we know it today. Some recommendations may adjust as conditions change. Continue to check for online updates available at our campus COVID-19 webpage. In addition, questions can be sent to publicaffairs@ucsc.edu. 
Sanitation
We continue to be proactive in our efforts to promote higher levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas across campus. It remains vital that everyone on campus assist by taking several actions, such as social distancing when possible; thorough hand washing to prevent the spread of disease; avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth; refraining from shaking hands; washing hands thoroughly before and after traveling from place to place; and cleaning work surfaces in personal work stations.  
Alternative work arrangements
Managers and supervisors should continue to implement temporary remote work arrangements to the greatest extent possible. For positions where remote work is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family. In addition, managers and supervisors should identify methods to adjust workspaces and work methods in ways that can promote social distancing. Additional guidance, including specifics on leave options, can be found in the message sent out on March 11 as well as at the UC Santa Cruz telecommuting guidance page. 
Travel
We are extending previously communicated guidance on travel. The following adjustments will now apply to travel taking place through the end of the spring quarter. Should conditions warrant it, we might lift these restrictions prior to that date.
All nonessential business-related staff and faculty travel scheduled to take place in spring quarter should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.


Those who oversee university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancellation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, mode of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.


On-campus Housing
In the chancellor’s message, she communicated that students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees, if applicable, if they decide to move out of campus housing. Specifics on refunds and applicable dates were communicated in Chancellor Larive’s message. Students who wish to move out of campus housing for the entire spring quarter must complete the online Intent to Vacate form, which is being sent out to residents shortly. 
For those remaining on campus, dining options will be available, though some services might be adapted or limited as conditions change.
In addition to the travel guidance outlined here, the previously communicated travel directives outlined by the UC Office of the President remain in effect. 
On-campus events, campus-sponsored events 
For all events scheduled to take place through the end of April, the following should apply:
Postpone or cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance of more than 50. This number is consistent with guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host as well as university hosted events on off-campus locations.


For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.


Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be postponed or canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.


Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled. 


Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from the Chancellor and interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.


Though the above guidance applies to already scheduled events taking place prior to the end of April, sponsors should review all events currently scheduled in spring quarter to assess whether additional postponements or cancelations are necessary. Individuals with questions about contracts for currently scheduled events can contact the Office of Campus Counsel for guidance.  
In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled to take place during spring quarter where event characteristics match those outlined above. This restriction could be lifted if conditions warrant.
Discussions on how to manage commencement are underway and will be communicated soon.
Campus meetings
Where possible, campus departments are strongly advised to utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel within the campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancellations.
Research business continuity
The Office of Research has provided online resources outlining guidance on a variety of topics. One primary consideration for principal officers remains the need to ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations. 
Our campus emergency response team continues to work with units across campus to ensure our response is robust and we are able to support the health and safety of our campus community. As this situation is continually evolving, additional guidance will be sent out as operational needs adjust.

In the past week, the Santa Cruz community learned of more cases of COVID–19. Additional cases were confirmed in Santa Cruz (7) and Santa Clara (more than 65) counties. One of the Santa Cruz cases involves an employee at Rio Del Mar Elementary School. County health officials are investigating all cases, and school and airport authorities are taking actions for prevention.
As we learn of more cases in our community, it is natural for everyone to feel concerned about potential exposure to someone with COVID–19, and it’s sensible to take precautions.
We write to offer guidance for when you hear from staff who are concerned about exposure to COVID–19, who are being tested for COVID–19, and/or who may have a confirmed case of COVID–19 in their close community of relatives and friends. Often when these reports are made, they come with great expectations for managers to immediately do something - for example, close an office, notify a community/department or other cohort, request that everyone be tested and so on. It is critical that as campus leaders, we take pause to act efficiently and methodically, so as not to make a misstep. The information below is designed to help managers assess the situation and identify steps to take.
As a first step, managers need to remember that medical information about individuals is protected under HIPAA and student information is protected under HIPAA and FERPA. It’s critical that information be held in confidence and that disclosures of protected information are managed within federal and University policy. We remind you to take great care to avoid unnecessarily disclosing anyone’s medical condition or other private information.
What to do if:
An employee shares information that they were exposed to someone confirmed to have COVID–19.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
Are they certain it was a confirmed case?
Was the exposure direct and close contact?
When did the exposure occur? Where?
Is the employee feeling any symptoms?
Notify the Director of Emergency Services, Lisa Ehret at (831) 234–3551 or EHS Director Lisa Wisser at (831) 212–2839‬. After discussing the circumstances with Emergency Services, you will receive support and guidance on what to do.
An employee shares information that they ‘think’ they were exposed to an individual with COVID–19 symptoms.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
What were the circumstances of the possible exposure?
Was the exposure direct and close contact? Where did this happen?
Do they know the symptoms the person was experiencing? If yes, what were they?
Is the employee feeling any symptoms?
If there is no direct evidence of a COVID–19 exposure, no further action is necessary within your unit. However, please notify the Office of Emergency Services of this event, oes@ucsc.edu.
An employee shares that they are being tested for COVID–19.
Gather as much information about the circumstances as you can, without asking about the employee’s private health information.
What were the circumstances of the possible exposure?
When and where did the exposure occur?
Remind the employee about the support available.
Notify Director of Emergency Management, Lisa Ehret, (831) 234–3551 or EHS Director Lisa Wisser at (831) 212–2839. After discussing the circumstances with Emergency Services, you may be advised to:
Receive and forward a campus advisory communication to your unit. The advisory may include directions regarding remote operations or other instructions. The content for this communication will be provided by Emergency Services.
As a manager, ensure your team has the resources necessary for remote operations. For essential operations that cannot be performed remotely, assign members who have not been exposed.
Emergency Services will provide guidance with respect to issues related to self-quarantine, isolation, telecommuting, etc.

Note: Emergency Services will coordinate closely with the campus Critical Incident Management Team (CIMT) inclusive of EH&S and Student Health Center experts who are in consultation and coordination with Santa Cruz County Health.
SCENARIOS:
Q. An employee came to work while they were sick. This event raised concerns by members of the department. Should I direct the office to work remotely?
If it was observed that the ill colleague was showing signs of fever, cough or shortness of breath, then managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence.

Dear Residential Student and Campus Community members,
Dining Services continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving COVID–19 situation. Given today’s declaration by Gov. Gavin Newsom regarding limitations of restaurant seating and expansion of social distancing we have made shifts to our operation delivery plan for the week of March 16–20, 2020 in an effort to keep our patrons safely fed.
Starting Monday, March 16th, several operational changes will be in effect. The following facilities will all maintain their normal operating schedules, barring unforeseen shortages in staffing availability, but will be implementing changes to delivery as outlined below. Please regularly check the UCSC Dining website for updates.
Cowell Dining Hall
Colleges 9/10 Dining Hall
Rachel Carson Dining Hall
PERK at Baskin Engineering
At this time all other Dining Hall and Dining Retail locations are expected to remain closed:
Crown and Porter Dining Halls
Stevenson Coffee House
Oakes Cafe
College Eight Cafe
Banana Joe’s
Terra Fresca Fresca Restaurant and Coffee Bar
PERK Carts at Earth and Marine Sciences (EMS) and the Physical Sciences Building (PSB)
What’s shifting with how patrons may get their meals?
All meals must be taken “to go” from the Dining facility.
No more than 50 patrons will be permitted to enter the facility at one time.
You are encouraged to maintain a 6-foot social distance radius from the next person waiting in line so as to minimize any unnecessary exposure.
Upon entry you are encouraged to sign up for the Eco Box program which allows you to use and return your box to be washed for reuse by another patron in the dining hall. No fee will be assessed for utilizing this program. Compostable “To go” boxes will be made available for all others.
Patrons on a 5- and 7-day meal plan will not be limited to the number of to go or eco box meals they may take per day, but consideration for those who may be waiting in lines is appreciated.
Food handler gloves will be provided upon entrance and all patrons are encouraged to wear them at the self-service stations (deli, salad and dessert bars).
Dining Services staff will continue to be proactive in promoting the highest levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas.
As staffing levels or other precautions necessitate, Dining may need to continue to adjust the dining operations program and schedule throughout the week. Please stay informed of additional operational changes by checking the UCSC Dining website.
Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

As the COVID–19 virus mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations. As communicated earlier today in a message sent by interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, all instruction, including labs and studio courses, will now be done solely via remote modalities for the entire spring quarter.
This afternoon, the Health Officer for the County of Santa Cruz issued a Shelter in Place Order and the Health Officer for the County of Santa Clara issued a Shelter in Place Order both of which are in effect through April 7. These directives mandate that people self-isolate, except to leave to provide or receive essential services, and permits the continuation of essential businesses. “Essential businesses” that can continue during this shelter in place period include educational institutions defined as:
“Educational institutions—including public and private K–12 schools, colleges, and universities—for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential functions, provided that social distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible”
In light of these latest actions, the following changes will apply to campus operations at locations in Santa Cruz County. Campus locations outside of Santa Cruz County will be making localized decisions based on guidance from local health officials and additional communications to those groups will be coming out shortly. We are moving to a reduced mode of operation through April 7, and expanding previously communicated changes to spring quarter operations. Additional changes might need to be made as the situation continues to evolve.
Though we have not had a confirmed case of COVID–19 on campus at this point, these changes are being made to support the health and safety of our campus community.
Final Examinations
Students should expect remote final examinations will be held at their scheduled time unless they hear otherwise from their instructor. Students who are not able to complete their remote final examination due to travel or technology limitations should contact their instructor to discuss options. Instructors should be in regular communication with their students regarding details surrounding the remote final examination.
Student Housing
We strongly urge students who are able to safely return to their permanent residence to do so by Sunday, March 29, and plan to remain there for the remainder of the academic year. The shelter in place orders allow for this travel. Exceptions to stay in campus housing beyond Sunday, March 29 will be made for students who meet one of the following:
do not have access to alternate housing;
have economic needs that do not enable them to return to their permanent residence;
can not relocate due to personal health or safety considerations;
have permanent residences in areas highly impacted by COVID–19;
have permanent residences that do not have the infrastructure needed to support remote learning; or
have other situations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Students who intend to vacate need to complete a form to initiate the check-out and refund processes. Students who remove all of their belongings from their campus residence and return their keys by April 5 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Students unable to move their belongings out by April 5 can work with the Housing Office to determine if alternative arrangements are available. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee. The Campus Housing Office will provide additional information for those students remaining on campus for spring via one of the exceptions listed above. Students who have questions about this process should contact their relevant Housing/Student Life Office.
Dining Services
Effective today (March 16), Dining Services has moved to a take-out only mode and has reduced the number of open dining spaces.
Campus Events
Campus events and events hosted in/on campus facilities will be canceled or postponed through the remainder of the spring quarter. Event sponsors can contact the Office of the Campus Counsel to discuss considerations for event contracts. Information on commencement will be forthcoming.
Campus Travel
All campus travel scheduled to take place before April 7 that does not comply with orders outlined in the Shelter in Place directive should be canceled or postponed. All non-essential business travel after April 7 should be canceled or postponed for the rest of the spring quarter. Principal Officers will provide guidance on any needed exceptions, though they must comply with other local and federal travel guidelines.
Employees and Leave Options
Only those employees who must be on campus to maintain critical operations should come to the campus through April 7. Principal Officers should provide guidance on the minimal on-campus operations required during this time and communicate to their staff. Guidance regarding operations after that date will be forthcoming. All others should work remotely. For those unable to work remotely, and in order to support our employees during this unprecedented time, UC President Janet Napolitano has implemented new leave guidelines as follows:
All employees shall be eligible to receive a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject to the following conditions:
All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire;
The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health;
The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time shall be prorated according to the percent of the appointment;
Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the one-time allotment of the paid administrative leave.
The paid administrative leave hours may only be used for the following purposes:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID–19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID–19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID–19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID–19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
Research Activities
The Office of Research has been coordinating research continuity planning across divisions. Additional information is available online. Principal Officers can provide division-specific guidance on how research should be handled during the shelter in place.
Planned Power Outage
The planned power outage scheduled to take place during spring break in order to connect the new PV array at the East Remote lot will be delayed to a later date.
Libraries
McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library will be open on Tuesday, March 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Both libraries will be closed on Wednesday, March 18 and will remain closed until April 7.
Bookstore
The bookstore will be closed to walk-in shopping. Online orders can be picked up at the will call window. The Express Store will remain open but will follow stringent social distancing guidelines and limit the number of individuals allowed inside at any time.
This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation. We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we collectively work to mitigate the spread of COVID–19.",Santa Cruz

I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections, extended to the full spring quarter, will include all labs, studios, field research, and field study courses. The suspension of in-person instructional meetings includes doctoral and masters thesis defenses and oral examinations and all meetings of lab research groups. There will be no exemptions for in-person instructional activities.

I want to acknowledge the many efforts of faculty and all instructional staff to revise curriculum and pedagogy to incorporate remote instruction into this set of instructional meetings. I know this kind of instructional redesign takes real time and effort, and I appreciate these efforts to maintain instructional continuity. Extending remote instruction comprehensively is a decision made in consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.
 
Some lab, studio and field study courses may not be readily transferable to a remote instruction format without significant impact on student learning and the ability of the course to meet approved learning outcomes. If so, this may lead program faculty to consider temporarily modifying program requirements to waive such a course as part of the degree requirements for graduating seniors. Earlier today, the relevant Academic Senate committees (CEP, CCI, and GC) released a communication with instructions to department chairs.

Library access
McHenry Library and the Science & Engineering Library will be open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. today, March 16. On March 17, 18, and 19, the two libraries will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. This move to more limited hours will reduce exposure for building occupants and increase capacity to disinfect library spaces and materials.
 
Effective Friday, March 20, McHenry Library and the Science & Engineering Library will be closed through the end of spring break. The libraries will re-open at 8 a.m. on March 30.

Dining
Starting today, Dining Services has changed its operations in an effort to keep its patrons safely fed. The changes will be in effect until at least March 20.
 
Cowell Dining Hall, Colleges 9/10 Dining Hall, Rachel Carson Dining Hall, and PERK at Baskin Engineering will keep their normal schedules. However, all will be implementing the following changes:
All meals must be taken “to go” from the Dining facility.
No more than 50 patrons will be permitted to enter the facility at one time.
Patrons are encouraged to maintain a 6-foot social distance radius from the next person waiting in line so as to minimize any unnecessary exposure.
Food handler gloves will be provided upon entrance and all patrons are encouraged to wear them at the self-service stations (deli, salad and dessert bars).

Athletics and Recreation
The East and West Recreation Facilities are closed, effective March 15. A date to reopen the facilities has not yet been determined.

The outdoor fields, jogging path, hiking trails, west tennis and basketball courts and fitness multi-station remain available.

The health and safety of our campus community continues to be our highest priority, and we are making several changes, detailed below, based on the governor’s announcements and the guidance of health officials.

To date, there are no confirmed cases on campus. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience as we work to reduce the opportunities for COVID-19 to spread on our campus and regional community. Thank you again for all you are doing to help protect our campus and community.

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
As you know, we are in the midst of a dangerous global pandemic and the County of Santa Cruz has issued a Shelter in Place Order for all residents. For the safety of our campus community, we are now in the process of winding down all but essential on-campus operations. Late last week we sent out an email to all researchers about our Research Continuity with COVID-19 webpage, in which we recommended that faculty and researchers take certain steps to prepare for a possible campus shutdown. We are writing now to require that all labs follow that guidance and, as spelled out further below, obtain approval for any research projects and key research personnel you believe must remain active on campus during this time. Until further notice, all projects and personnel not approved are required to wind down on-campus research operations by the end of the week. For the purposes of this communication, on-campus refers to all research operations at UCSC locations within a jurisdiction with a Shelter in Place Order.

Even where research is deemed essential, we need to reduce the density of people working in UCSC research spaces. All principal investigators must communicate with trainees and other lab members about preparation for the shutdown of all non-critical research activities.

We understand that the long-term viability of many research programs during this period will require management of essential animal lines, equipment, liquid nitrogen stocks, and certain long-term experiments. To meet these needs, each laboratory (or neighboring group of laboratories) must identify 1-2 key personnel who will be responsible for any essential ongoing maintenance.

When determining the appropriate size of your lab’s “skeleton crew,” please also consider any equipment that might require gas or cryogen monitoring/service, such as deep-storage freezers, electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, and incubators. Keep in mind that any potentially hazardous operation will require at least two trained and qualified persons be present. We are providing a “Lab Ramp-Down Checklist” that was assembled by EH&S and the Office of Research. It should be noted that in a campus curtailment, there will be limited EH&S support and their response capabilities may be diminished.

Our mouse facilities have been in direct communication with laboratories and have procedures in place to deal with curtailed operations. Individual labs using aquatic or avian species are expected to maintain basic animal care and husbandry operations, and labs with USDA-covered animals that require specialized lab care or intensive husbandry operations are expected to continue providing this care. 

For all key personnel, it has been mandated that everyone practice good hygiene and social distancing, in part by coordinating with others to minimize time on campus and to avoid being in the lab or animal facilities at the same time as others.

To continue their research at home, laboratory members should be encouraged to work on writing projects, literature review, data analysis, or online learning (coding, statistics, etc.). Be sure that lab members are well equipped to work remotely.

If there are essential personnel necessary for the continuation of ongoing critical experiments, instrument maintenance or animal care, you will be required to request permission using this Essential Research Exception Request form. The form will be routed to your Department Chair, Dean, and VCR for approval. Only those meeting the criteria below will be approved.

Criteria for essential personnel

1) Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals and other not easily replaceable perishable research materials.

 Examples:
- Vivarium staff
- Non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care
- Greenhouse staff
- Faculty/research staff necessary to maintain other not easily replaceable perishable research materials. This could be primary cell lines or long-term experiments that there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end. (For example, if there has been a continual one-month experiment that has been on-going that requires regular measurements or maintenance to maintain otherwise all previous data is lost).

2) Responsible for maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage or high cost to equipment.

Examples:
- Cryogen fill on the NMR spectrometer

3) Conducting experiments that have a small time window for completion.

Examples: 
- Time-sensitive experiments with not easily replaceable perishable research materials
- Experiments with a specific measurement that can only take place a few times a year

4) Conducting critical COVID-19 research.

5) Necessary for other critical research/lab-related functions not covered under the above definitions whose presence can prevent danger or significant damage to facilities or research activities.

We completely understand that these restrictions are difficult for you and your laboratory personnel. Our focus at this time is on maintaining safety while avoiding catastrophic damage to people’s research and careers. We hope you appreciate the full magnitude of this crisis and understand that these short-term setbacks will lead to a better outcome for our entire community.

Dear Resident,

Action Required by Friday, March 20. Please read below for instructions.

The emergence of COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for communities all across the country. As COVID-19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations.

In order to dramatically reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge students who can safely leave to do so by Sunday, March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.

ACTION REQUIRED by March 20: Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants
Students departing Housing - Complete the Intent to Vacate form (form requires a UCSC account)
Students remaining in Housing - Complete the Remain in Residence form (form requires a UCSC account)
Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the Late Checkout form.

More detail below:

Students Moving Out of University Housing
Whether you have already left campus or are planning to soon, please complete the Intent to Vacate form (form requires a UCSC account) by Friday, March 20. If you have already completed this form then you do not need to complete it again.

Students who complete their move-out and/or have submitted their Intent to Vacate notice by Friday, March 20 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time.

We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.

Additionally, we will not be voiding guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13-20 Priority Housing Application Period.

Students Remaining in University Housing
If you need to remain in university housing through spring, please indicate that by completing the Remain in Residence form by Friday, March 20.

Students may consider remaining on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
Do not have access to alternate housing
Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence
Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation
Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning
Other extenuating circumstances
As a university, we understand the challenges faced in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distancing on our campus.

It is likely we will need to close some of the residential buildings and relocate those students remaining on campus into fewer locations, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.

Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we work to keep students and the UCSC community healthy and safe.

Guidance for Employees and Supervisors Regarding the Use of Paid Administrative Leave Pursuant to President Napolitano’s Executive Order Dated March 16, 2020
The University of California has modified the emergency temporary leave policies issued on March 9th in accordance with an Executive Order issued by President Napolitano on March 16th granting paid administrative leave to university employees who are impacted by the COVID-19 emergency. This message provides guidance about how we will implement the Executive Order (EO) for academic, staff and student employees at UC Santa Cruz.

This remains a very fluid situation, and the guidance below may be updated as new information becomes available. Managers and supervisors are encouraged to provide as much flexibility as possible to employees needing to take leave.

All Employees
Effective immediately, all employees (including staff, academic and student employees) will be eligible to receive up to 128 hours paid administrative leave in order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Paid Administrative Leave may only be used for the following purposes:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID-19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the dependent care commitment.
The allocation for employees with less than full time appointments shall be prorated based on appointment percentage
The 128 hours may be used consecutively in one block or incrementally
In making the determination as to whether to grant the leave, supervisors must take into account the operational needs of the University with special consideration given to the critical importance of maintaining the continuity of medical center operations
Employees may still use accrued sick, vacation or paid time off in order to address their own illness or the serious medical condition of a family member.
The Paid Administrative Leave may be used prior to usage of other accrued leave.
Paid Administrative Leave can be used retroactively to March 1, 2020.
Subject to the University’s ongoing operational needs, the paid administrative leave provided pursuant to the Executive Order must be used no later than December 31, 2020.
Paid Administrative Leave is available for any new employees hired during the duration of President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.
An employee who separates from the employment of the University before December 31, 2020 will lose eligibility for Paid Administrative Leave; there is no “cash-in” value connected to the leave.
Employees who are essential to on-campus operations may be required to come to work to ensure educational and business continuity. Managers and employees are encouraged to work together to formulate plans for shift coverage in these essential operational areas to ensure social distancing practices are being followed.

Staff Employees

All individual staff employees are eligible for administrative leave with pay. However, individuals who do not meet one of the three criteria described in the EO for using administrative leave with pay will need to cover unplanned absences with accruals. Additionally, supervisors are required to approve the administrative leave with pay, and such approval will be based on operational necessity to continue essential services.

At this time, formal telecommuting agreements are not being used for COVID-19 related remote work. Supervisors and managers should exercise discretion in determining whether individuals may take home university property to complete work from home. If university property, such as laptops, keyboards, or other items, are brought home by employees, supervisors are encouraged to log equipment serial numbers to track which items are being used in employee homes.  

Individual staff members who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on their timesheet on that day.   

Supervisors and managers will need to work with their employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the four criteria. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual time records. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.

Part time employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee’s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule. 

Employees who are currently on an approved leave of absence (not related to COVID-19) should continue to record your sick leave and/or vacation leave as discussed in your leave consultation.  If your circumstances have changed, due to COVID-19, please work directly with your Leave Coordinator.

Hourly Student Employees

Student employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee’s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule. 

Individual student employees who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Student employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on the timesheet.   

Supervisors and managers will need to work with their student employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the COVID related reasons. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual timesheets. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.

Academic Employees

Paid Administrative Leave is available for all academic appointees, policy-covered and represented, for the COVID-19-related reasons described in President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.

Use of Paid Administrative Leave must not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services. The delivery of instruction is an essential university service. Faculty who are unable to continue delivering instruction should immediately notify their department chair.

Employees who report time or absences in CruzPay should record Paid Administrative Leave on their timesheets. Employees will select “Admin Leave with Pay” and indicate “COVID” in the note section on the timesheet on that day. When approving timesheets, supervisors are affirming that Paid Administrative Leave is being used in accordance with the Executive Order.
For exempt academic employees, Paid Administrative Leave only needs to be reported for full-day absences; a day is defined as the regular time that an appointee would have worked on that day. For such exempt employees, there will be up to 16 days on which the Paid Administrative Leave would occur.
For non-exempt hourly employees, Paid Administrative Leave should be reported on the timesheet in hourly increments. Non-exempt employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on the appointment percentage.
For faculty and academic student employees who do not complete timesheets (TAs, GSIs, and GSRs), Paid Administrative Leave of 16 days or less should be arranged with the chair/ supervisor. Employees must notify their department chair or faculty supervisor and divisional academic personnel coordinator if they anticipate an absence of more than 16 days, whether consecutive or intermittent. Divisional academic personnel staff will advise employees and supervisors about all available paid leave options on a case by case basis. Divisional staff may consult with the Academic Personnel Office as needed.

Paid medical leave policies in the Academic Personnel Manual (APM 710) and respective collective bargaining agreements (Academic Researchers, Postdocs, Academic Student Employees, Non-Senate Instructional Unit, and Librarians) that are currently available for an appointee’s own illness will extend to cover all COVID-19 qualifying situations, including to care for a family member’s COVID-19 illness, and/or when working remotely is not operationally feasible and the appointee is directed or is under a public order to not to come to work. These extensions of academic policy are in place for the duration of President Napolitano’s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.

Paid Administrative Leave is not available for academic appointees in courtesy or without-salary appointments.

Deans retain the authority to provide leave with pay to academic employees for other good cause as delegated in CAPM 900.700.

For academic employees who are currently on leave, have by-agreement appointments, or for other questions, please consult with your Divisional Academic Personnel Office.",Santa Cruz

Our community has pulled together in positive ways in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The current Santa Cruz County and Santa Clara County shelter-in-place orders, plus last night’s statewide stay-at-home order, mandate that we be more explicit in how we respond to this growing public health challenge. 
Further, we understand there may be some confusion or lack of clarity regarding what members of the campus community can do in their work capacity and when they should and should not come to campus locations to work. This memo supersedes all earlier communications, except the Research and Instructional staff directive issued earlier today to instructors, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students.
The information below reflects directives from the university; they are not guidelines. All employees and students must adhere to these directives. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Earlier today we sent a communication specifically addressing the workplace concerns of research and instructional staff and graduate students. 
Dos
Do come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation of the university. Principal officers have been asked to work with managers to identify essential positions that may require work on the residential campus or other campus locations. If you believe that the operation you are supporting is not essential but there is an expectation that you come to work anyway, you may seek confirmation of the essential nature of your work by emailing your principal officer.  


Do come to the residential campus or other campus locations if your supervisor directs you to do so for a specific or limited purpose, even if you are generally working from home. You are allowed to come to campus locations for this purpose.


Do feel free to park in any designated campus parking lot if you are directed to come to work at campus locations. Daytime parking lot enforcement has been suspended at the residential campus, the West Side Research Park, and the Coastal Science Campus so that employees may park closer to needed facilities, reduce the distance they have to walk, and avoid taking public transportation if they choose to do so. 


Do feel free to visit the campus COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address loneliness and isolation that may occur while we are under the shelter-in-place order.


 Don'ts
Do not come to work if you are sick. 


Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave. 


Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down or continuity work as approved and directed by the Vice Chancellor for Research.  Separate, specific guidance has been issued to campus researchers.


Do not come to work at campus locations solely because your home internet access is inadequate, or because the conditions at your home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Staff and faculty who need these resources should address their needs with their supervisor or department chair. There is also a list of helpful resources on the COVID-19 Information Technology Services website.


Do not come to the residential campus or other campus locations because there is something in your office that you would like to retrieve, or because you want to visit with colleagues who must work on campus. You should only be coming to a campus location if your supervisor has given you express permission to do so. Your supervisor can give you permission to come to campus on a one-time basis or as otherwise necessary.  


Building access
The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites, including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes. 
We know that these are challenging times and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through these issues. These directives are designed to further protect our campus community and give you confidence that your work is consistent with the shelter-in-place orders and the statewide stay-at-home order. These directives are intended to safeguard the maintenance of the essential and critical operations of the campus. Please take care of yourselves and be well.",Santa Cruz

We are all working hard to adapt to the greater Bay Area and statewide shelter-in-place directives issued this week. UC Santa Cruz employees are permitted by these orders to continue to come to work to carry out the university's essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work at all campus locations to perform duties related to remote instruction and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and essential research continuity. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.
Please read through the detailed information below. These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.
Coverage of this directive
This message is a formal employment directive issued by the interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, and the Vice Chancellor for Research, and it applies to all employees and faculty including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers who are engaged in instruction and research. This directive applies to research and instructional faculty, staff and students; it does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is otherwise determined to be essential. 
Remote instruction 
Faculty, graduate students (in their capacity as TAs and GSIs), and staff may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. We have suspended our Webcast service and it will not be available during the spring quarter. Classrooms will not be available for the preparation or execution of remote instruction. Instructors, teaching assistants, and the staff who support them in remote instruction may use private offices to access the internet for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. Access to, and the use of, private offices must conform to standards of social distancing. 
In cases where remote instruction is possible only with the use of campus facilities, approval must be obtained from department chairs and the relevant dean. Please note that exemptions for use of specialized facilities will be limited to a small number of previously determined lab and studio courses. With the exception of private offices, all uses of campus facilities for the facilitation of remote instruction must be approved in advance and must incorporate mandated standards of social distancing. For approval, please contact your department chair, college provost or program director, who will facilitate approval with the dean. 
As you make the change to fully remote instruction, first visit our Keep Teaching website to take advantage of the teaching resources, technical information and guidance, and virtual consultation services. Resources and consultation are available to support you as you transition to a fully remote environment. Group and individual consultation services can be scheduled by contacting citl@ucsc.edu or help@ucsc.edu. 
Research 
Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may only engage in essential on-campus research continuity activities with the specific approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research. See the March 17 message for further details. PIs will be notified about approvals on a rolling basis. 
No one supporting the campus research enterprise may come to campus for any purpose without approval, nor may approved researchers support or engage in activities that have not been explicitly approved by the VCR. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, contact your department chair, Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research (vcr@ucsc.edu), or Quentin Williams, acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies (qwilliam@ucsc.edu). 
Classroom access
Classrooms will be locked and remain locked through the spring quarter. Some buildings will be locked with access limited to key-card holders. Building managers will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.
The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes. 
When working from home has limitations
Other than the exceptions listed above, no employee, graduate student or instructor supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their campus office to work. Beyond those work environment needs dictated by a responsibility to provide remote instruction, inadequate home internet or home conditions that are not conducive to efficient work are not allowed reasons to come to campus. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Instructors and staff who need equipment to work from home should request support from their supervisor or department chair. 
A word of thanks
We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already enormously stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and the considerable work of all members of our community that we know is going into making these transitions. These changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university. 
In these difficult times, as a public university all UC campuses are prioritizing our shared teaching mission. In putting the academic interests of our students first, we acknowledge the tradeoffs, and to the fullest extent possible we will address the consequences of making these decisions. 
Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times. Be well.",Santa Cruz

Dear Housing Group,
You are receiving this message because we have still not heard from you regarding your residency intentions for spring. As stated in our previous messages on March 13 and March 17, all residential students must complete one of the two forms below. As COVID–19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations. In order to dramatically and immediately reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge all students who can leave campus to do so by Sunday, March 29. Travel to return to your permanent residence is encouraged and permissible.
While students may remain in residence this spring if they fall into one of the categories outlined below, there are operational impacts that will be experienced given COVID–19.
If you intend to leave campus, complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing.
Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the Late Checkout form.
If you do not have an alternate safe housing option and must remain in university housing, complete the Remain in Residence form. See the below list of qualifying reasons to remain in housing.
We are committed to supporting all of our students through this outbreak, especially those who must remain in housing. We want you to know the latest information, so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices.
We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID–19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, testing would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.
The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing andextra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people living in and supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID–19.
It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID–19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the infection to spread.
We will need to close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.
Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.
Students Moving Out of University Housing
As stated in our original communication, if you complete your move-out by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time. Further, more recently we asked that students who can safely leave by Sunday, March 29, please do so. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.
We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which the move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.
Additionally, we will not be voiding housing guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a housing guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13–20 Priority Housing Application Period.
Students Planning to Remain in University Housing
Students may remain in university housing during spring only if one or more of the following conditions apply:
Do not have access to alternate housing
Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence
Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation
Permanent residence is in an area highly impacted by COVID–19
Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning
Other extenuating circumstances
Thank you for your patience and flexibility.

Dear students,

We write today to acknowledge the challenges you have faced over the past two weeks as we switched to remote learning and final exams, and to express our sincere gratitude for taking the changes head on. These are not easy days, and you have demonstrated resilience and patience. Thank you.

As we face the enormous challenge of a global pandemic, we know that shifting to remote instruction will not be simple or seamless. But in accepting this change, you are helping us to reduce the density of people learning, living, and working on campus. That will ultimately help reduce the spread and intensity of COVID-19. The sacrifices you and all members of our campus community are making are crucial to efforts to quell this health crisis, and we are deeply grateful for your efforts in these unprecedented times.

Continuing to educate in the face of such uncertainty is not an attempt on our part to maintain normalcy. It highlights our commitment to you — our students — and to our community. Many of you depend on financial aid, and by helping you stay the course, we hope to keep you on track for graduation.

Crisis reveals the vulnerabilities of our systems and our ways of life. We are working to ensure our campus remains open to house those of you who need it, and to do so as safely as possible. We are only just beginning to understand the scale of this public health challenge and the changes needed to support our community. With that in mind, we also thank you for your engagement as these issues unfold.

This has not been an easy year for UC Santa Cruz. It has been and continues to be a privilege to face these difficulties and uncertainties alongside you. UCSC and our community will emerge from these challenges a stronger, more resilient campus.",Santa Cruz

22-Mar-20,488,"The Financial Aid Office shared an update with students about potential financial aid adjustments.

March 22 - Financial Aid and Spring Housing Adjustments Email
 
Dear Student,
We appreciate your patience as we work as quickly and carefully as possible during this unprecedented challenge to provide you with information and resources in support of your educational goals.
As communicated in messages from Campus Housing, students who have completed the process to fully vacate their on-campus residence by required deadlines will receive a credit for housing and dining fees assessed or paid for spring quarter. These adjustments to your housing and dining charges may result in increased financial aid refunds for financial aid recipients (see the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office message of March 18 and the linked COVID-19 website).
The processing of housing and dining credits will be on-going throughout the next few weeks. Staff in Financial Aid are working in parallel, adjusting aid as quickly as possible, with some student financial aid refunds delayed as work proceeds. In spite of these efforts, it is anticipated there will be some students who will see multiple financial aid refunds or receive additional billing due to the processing timeline. As compared to the normal spring budget for students commuting from home or living with parents, the new remote student budget includes an additional $2,000. The additional budget items are intended to address expenses such as housing, food, technology setup for remote instruction, medical and other costs you may incur during the spring term.
Students may receive financial aid refunds, through direct deposit or checks from Student Business Services, when the total accepted aid is greater than expenses billed by the campus (such as for tuition and fees, on-campus housing and dining, and USHIP). For on-campus students, such financial aid refunds may be modest or may not exist. Changing to the new remote student budget may change your financial aid refund.
For students who normally receive financial aid refunds, the amounts will vary depending upon accepted aid and remaining charges on the student account. An example of the possible change in refunded amounts for a $0 Expected Family Contribution (EFC) California (CA) Resident student is below:
$0 EFC CA Resident, On-Campus Triple Room 5-day meal plan with USHIP
Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $10,332
Total Spring Aid : $10,332 (includes $1,167 loan)
Estimated Spring Refund $ 0
 
$0 EFC CA Resident, Remote Instruction with USHIP
Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $5,670
Total Spring Aid : $9,145 (includes $1,167 loan)
Estimated Spring Refund $ 3,475
Spring disbursement of financial aid is scheduled for March 23, with direct deposit refunds on March 25 and paper check processing occurring on March 31. While our offices are working as quickly as possible to resolve financial aid and housing adjustments, there may continue to be activity on your account in the following weeks.
Thank you again for your patience,

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
We write to share that the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency confirmed today that a student member of the UC Santa Cruz community has tested positive for COVID-19. The student lives off campus and has been self-isolating since being tested. The student was last on campus March 16 and is doing well. 
We are coordinating closely with local public health officials and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance in responding to this case. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who may have had significant exposure to this individual and who may subsequently have an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Public health officials will determine specific actions that may be needed, such as self-quarantine. 
The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. The campus is ensuring that this student is getting the care and support that they need. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel continue to proactively identify individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure and request that they self-quarantine to protect our community. 
Students, faculty, and staff should stay home and call their health care provider if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, especially fever and cough. The CDC’s coronavirus self-checker is a good tool to help you determine what next steps should be taken.
What students should do
Students, whether on campus, off campus in Santa Cruz, or at their permanent residence, can call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make a telehealth or in-person appointment. Information about after-hours care for students is available online. Acutely ill students who are not in Santa Cruz should seek medical care from a healthcare provider in their area.
If you are a student who received care off-campus and have tested positive, or if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, please notify the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 so that we can help coordinate your care and support the health of our campus community.
What employees should do
Employees should seek medical care through their regular health care providers. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at oes@ucsc.edu.
Where you can find updates and additional information
The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.
We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this challenging time. 
Steps to stay healthy 
The CDC provides the following guidance on how to protect yourself: 
Clean your hands often:
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. 
Avoid close contact with others:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Put distance between yourself and other people (at least 6 feet).
Take steps to protect others:
Stay home, except for essential business/services as covered in the state’s stay-at-home order.
Cover coughs and sneezes:
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
Throw used tissues in the trash.
Immediately clean your hands.
Wear a facemask if you are sick and around other people.

Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation
To: Campus Housing Residents
From: UCSC Student Housing Services

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus. Students who can return to a permanent address or make alternate housing arrangements have been encouraged to leave campus. However, we understand that leaving campus may not be an option for everyone and we are committed to supporting our students through this outbreak.
In order to focus our staffing and support services on the needs of a smaller residential population on campus, we will be relocating the following residents:
Students living in residence halls
Students living at the Camper Park, Village, or University Town Center
Students living in apartments at Cowell College, Redwood Grove, and the Porter Apartment Buildings F and G
Students will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College, or Merrill College. It is our goal to:
Reassign apartment residents to the apartments at one of the above communities.
Reassign residence hall residents to the residence hall facilities at one of the above communities. These housing areas are in proximity to one of the two campus dining halls that we currently plan to keep open (College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown Dining Hall).
Moving assistance will be provided. This will include moving bins, supplies such as cardboard boxes and tape, as well as movers and trucks to transport your belongings to your new housing assignment.
Housing staff are currently working on your new housing assignment. You will soon receive a message with information about your new room assignment and instructions for completing your move. To be clear, this move is mandatory and we appreciate your cooperation. Note: special attention is being placed on students with disability-related needs to ensure the new housing assignment will meet their individual needs.
In order to maximize efficient use of housing space, while also implementing appropriate physical distancing for residents, each room will be assigned as a single. Students will not be negatively financially impacted by this change to single occupancy residency. Instead all residential students will be charged the triple room rate for spring quarter. Additionally, students on the 5-day meal plan for spring quarter will be upgraded, at no additional cost, to the 7-day plan to ensure dining access during the weekends. Students already on the 7-day plan for spring quarter will receive a rate reduction to the cost of the 5-day plan. Apartment residents who wish to obtain the 7-day meal plan at the 5-day plan cost may do so.
You are receiving this letter because you have indicated that you plan to remain in residence this spring. We want you to know the latest information so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. If you can make alternate housing arrangements, we strongly urge you to do so. If you do plan to leave campus, please complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing as soon as possible. We will continue to offer a full housing refund for spring quarter to students who give their intent to vacate and complete their move-out by April 19.
Based upon the current public health information available, the following details the conditions we anticipate in our residential buildings during spring quarter. Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation and circumstances may change further.
We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, it would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.
The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with physical distancing recommendations, cessation of group gatherings, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people residing in as well as staff supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID-19.
It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the virus to spread.
We will close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve physical distancing.
Any resident who remains on campus for spring should be prepared to be relocated (possibly more than once) so that we may create spaces for isolation as well as quarantine.
Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.
We appreciate that this information may add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you.
Since you are planning to remain in residence during spring, please begin to prepare yourself for relocation, and follow instructions that will follow from your Housing/Student Life Office.
Sincerely,
Student Housing Services",Santa Cruz

Dear Staff and Faculty Colleagues,
COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for us. Among those many challenges is the question of whether and how we can continue to employ students. I’m writing with thoughts related to this question.
For many students, whether they are eligible for work-study or not, a campus-paid job is part of their financial aid plan. The prospect of losing income now because of COVID-19 could create hardship, possibly even endangering their ability to continue as students. I have already heard from students who are deeply concerned over the possible loss of income, and who starting spring quarter may be unable to pay for rent and buy groceries. Obviously, challenges like this disproportionately affect our students who are historically underserved, a barrier to our goal of equity of outcomes.
In addition to sustaining a student financially, employment is also a key part of the student experience, engaging them and contributing to student professional development. Now more than ever, continuing to provide engagement and developmental experiences would be helpful to our students.
For all of these reasons, for those of you who have been employing students, I encourage you to continue doing so to the fullest extent possible during this period of COVID-19.
There are many ways of employing students even remotely. Students can complete special assignments, projects, or job-related reading or training. Now could be a great time to catch up on projects and tasks that we often delay because of our busy work days. I encourage you to be creative in offering work to our students to help mitigate the impact of losing income. Our FAQ page on student employment (see below) offers more ideas. (Please note, however: students should not be assigned work or hired into positions that would otherwise be completed by career employees if career employees need additional hours to fulfill their appointment percentages.)
We recognize that you may have many questions about hiring students given our new realities. For example, can Work Study students be employed remotely? Answer: Yes! To help you get answers, we have created this FAQ page. We will continue to improve it, and we welcome your feedback on it.
Thanks for everything you’re doing to support our students.

The UC Santa Cruz community continues to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are being proactive in maximizing physical distancing, while maintaining the critical operations needed to support students and employees who continue to live on campus, to facilitate remote learning, and to ensure the campus infrastructure is maintained and campus facilities are safe. The COVID-19 situation continues to be dynamic. Not only does it impact campus operations, but it has impacted the personal lives of everyone in the campus community and across the globe. Thank you for your cooperation and patience as we navigate the situation and collectively work to mitigate the spread of the virus.
Over the last few weeks, we have outlined the steps we are taking during this public health crisis in several campus messages. Our actions have adapted over time as we learn more and as we comply with federal, state and local mandates, as well as guidance coming from the UC Office of the President. Yesterday, the Santa Cruz County Health Department issued a new order extending the current shelter in place mandate until May 3 and outlining additional clarifications on allowable activities. They also issued a useful FAQ that addresses questions members of the Santa Cruz community have. 
Our campus continues to be defined in the directive as an essential institution and activities we undertake for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential functions are allowable, provided that physical distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.
Below is an update on the latest information on campus operations. Please note that some restrictions that had been put in place until April 7 will now continue through at least May 3 to comply with new county orders. For additional information, you can access the UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 website.
Dining Services
Dining Services will be operating the College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown/Merrill Dining Hall during the spring quarter as a take-out only service.  Additional information is available at the Dining COVID-19 Response page.
Campus Housing
Students living in campus housing have been asked to return to their permanent residences if conditions allow. The housing office is relocating students who remain on campus in an effort to maximize physical distancing, while also ensuring staff can adequately support those who remain. Additional information can be found at the Housing COVID-19 page.
Campus Events
Guidance was given in earlier communications that campus events and events hosted in/on campus facilities should be canceled or postponed through the remainder of the spring quarter. No new events should be scheduled for the spring quarter. Event sponsors can contact the Office of the Campus Counsel to discuss considerations for event contracts. Information on commencement and guidance on summer event planning will be forthcoming.
Campus Travel
All campus travel scheduled to take place prior to May 3 that does not comply with current shelter-in-place directives should be canceled or postponed. All non-essential business should be canceled or postponed for the rest of the spring quarter. Principal officers will provide guidance on any needed exceptions, though they must comply with other local and federal travel guidelines.
Employees and Leave Options
Earlier this month, directives for employees and for research and instructional staff were shared to clarify expectations for working at and physically accessing campus locations. Principal officers have oversight of their divisions in determining the minimum staff members needed to maintain critical on-campus operations. The new COVID-19 administrative pay program launched earlier this month is still in effect and those leave hours can be used prior to December 31, 2020 to support employees unable to work due to COVID-19 related reasons. Staff Human Resources has developed an FAQ site to answer many questions related to staff employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic employees may refer to the Academic Personnel Office’s COVID-19 information site. 
Research Activities
The Office of Research has been coordinating research continuity planning across divisions. Additional information is available online. Principal officers can provide division-specific guidance on how research should be handled during the shelter in place.
Remote Instruction
The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning is offering resources and essential information for instructors at the Keep Teaching site.  
Library
Both the McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library will be closed until further notice. Services that involve accessing or exchanging physical items will not be offered. All patron-facing services will focus solely on online or remote options. More information about resources and contacts are available at the Library Remote Access webpage.  
Bookstore
The bookstore remains closed to walk-in shopping. Online orders for all products can be placed for pickup at the will call window or may be shipped, free of charge. The Express Store will remain open but will follow stringent social distancing guidelines and limit the number of individuals allowed inside at any time. More information can be found at the Bay Tree Bookstore site.
Outdoor Recreation
As outlined in the Santa Cruz Health Department order, outdoor recreation activities, including walking, hiking, bicycling, and running, must be in compliance with physical distancing, which is six feet of distance from other individuals.",Santa Cruz

Dear Student,
If you have already left campus and are unable to return to retrieve your belongings personally, you may need to contract with a personal moving service to pack your belongings and ship them to you. Many services are available, and focus on university students who need their rooms packed and their belongings shipped or stored. One option for shipping and/or storage of your belongings is Dormbox*, though there are other moving companies and you are encouraged to research your options.
As stated in our previous communication, students who complete their move-out (i.e. remove all belongings and return any university keys) by April 19 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Anyone who is still in residence after this date, or whose belongings remain in residence, will be charged for the period of time from the start of the quarter to the date their move-out is completed.
If you cannot retrieve your belongings by April 19, Dormbox is available to pack and ship/store your belongings before this deadline. Dormbox is scheduled to be at UCSC this Saturday 4/4 as well as Saturday 4/18 to assist students—students can be present, or not.
Signing up with Dormbox is easy:
1. Register with Dormbox. Provide your name, email, and phone number.
2. Provide Dormbox with information about where you’re living at UCSC.
3. Select a date and time preference for Dormbox to pack your belongings.

The focused effort and flexibility our community has displayed in the transition to remote teaching, learning, and research for the final weeks of winter quarter, and now spring quarter, has been remarkable. Your instructors and the many staff members who support students and research at UC Santa Cruz have worked incredibly hard to ensure we can continue to carry out our mission. Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we extend the physical boundaries of our academic community during our efforts to keep each other safe. 
We recognize that you have many questions and concerns as you head into the spring quarter, and we hope to address many of them below.
Tuition and mandatory fees
Consistent with guidance from the UC Office of the President, all tuition and campus-based fees (excluding housing and dining) will remain unchanged for students enrolled during spring quarter. While the modality of instruction and assessment has changed in many cases, we know that UC instructors and staff will continue to provide high-quality instruction, advising and support services to students while we remain apart. Students will continue to receive full credit for their courses just as they would were we not in a fully remote instructional environment. The emergency transition to remote learning has been costly as we support students, staff, and faculty to work and learn from afar while we continue to maintain significant campus operations. 
We also have had multiple inquiries about campus-based, mandatory fees. We understand that this announcement will be disappointing to many, but these fees are almost entirely determined by student referenda, and are not a direct charge for the use of on-campus facilities or services. Many of these fees support the salaries of student-facing staff who will continue to provide non-instructional services to students remotely. Campus fees also provide for the upkeep of crucial facilities that will still require maintenance throughout the coming months. Perhaps most importantly, these fees also support student financial aid and student initiatives that will continue remotely. These fees will not be redirected to any other purpose and will continue to be used to improve the student experience at UC Santa Cruz. 
Course fees are currently being examined on a course by course basis to determine which are still appropriate and which should be refunded. This work is ongoing and if you have questions about course fees, please contact the office offering the course. Miscellaneous fees are fees for services, and are only charged when the service is used. Units will make refund decisions for payments already received based on whether the service was available and utilized.
On-campus housing and other services
Over the past two weeks, the majority of students living on campus have returned to their permanent residences. Refunds of housing and dining charges for these groups are ongoing and may not be immediately reflected on your portal. 
Those who remain in on-campus housing are encouraged to continue maintaining physical distance from other residents and to follow the directions of the housing and dining staff. To better serve students and ensure that we can support our region through this public health crisis, housing staff is working to ensure each student has their own room in a staffed building. Please continue to check your UCSC email to receive timely updates on any changes to housing plans. 
Financial aid
The Financial Aid and Scholarship Office will continue to support students remotely via email this quarter. Because of the high-volume of changes and questions, please recognize that financial aid may not immediately reflect changes you have made to your enrollment, housing, or dining plans.
Student services
Most student services will continue to operate throughout the spring quarter. This includes the Student Health Center, which is currently providing phone appointments; Counseling and Psychological Services; the Office of Equity and Equal Protection, which supports students experiencing discrimination or harrassment, and the Dean of Students office, which can provide comprehensive case management for graduate and undergraduate students. 
Please continue to monitor your email as federal, state and county guidelines continue to change rapidly. We wish you the best of luck this quarter and encourage everyone to treat themselves and one another with patience during this difficult time.",Santa Cruz

We are deeply saddened and disappointed to hear about multiple instances of racist and offensive disruptions to class sessions held via Zoom. This behavior causes real harm and is not tolerated on our campus. Proliferating hate speech in online instructional spaces is not a prank or a joke and our campus is taking these actions very seriously. We ask you all to take them seriously as well and never share Zoom or other video conferencing links in any public forum.
These incidents, as well as recent racist posts on social media, are an attempt to divide our campus community and undermine our Principles of Community. We must come together—against racism, sexism, xenophobia, and white supremacy—and collectively denounce all forms of hate, bias, and discrimination.
While this behavior is never acceptable, it comes at a time when our community members are already burdened with concerns for loved ones, for our first responders and medical community, and for the many people currently battling COVID-19. Some have used this pandemic as an opportunity to incite xenophobia and hatred, particularly against Asian and Asian American people. Any attempt to blame COVID-19 on any group is discriminatory and unacceptable. We condemn any effort to turn this crisis into a vehicle to spread hate. 
We are sorry that anyone has experienced these discriminatory disruptions, and we thank you for continuing to support our community of learning. As we continue spring quarter remotely, we must do everything we can to keep our digital classroom environments safe and inclusive. Our Keep Teaching website offers instructions on how to create secure Zoom class meetings and prevent uninvited people from joining. 
If ZoomBombing occurs in your class:
Please open a ticket at help@ucsc.edu with the subject line “ZoomBombing in XXX [your course—ie, LIT 101]. Include information such as Meeting ID, CruzID of host, time of incident, did they use screen sharing, etc.


Students and faculty should refer to https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/ for hate/bias related incidents/comments during zoom classes.


To file a formal complaint about harassment and/or discrimination on the basis of a protected identity, students, staff, and faculty can make a report on-line using the reporting form on the Equity and Equal Protection homepage. To report an incident of sexual violence or sexual harassment contact the Title IX Office.


The Dean of Students Office and the Conduct and Community Standards Office are committed to working with our academic partners to make our online learning environment more secure, safe, and conducive to learning.

Important information regarding residential relocation
To: Housing Residents
From: UCSC Student Housing Services
April 06, 2020
Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
Dear Student,
On Sunday, March 29th, you received a notification that you may be required to move from your current campus residence to another space on campus for the remainder of the spring quarter. While the exact date of relocation and details related to your specific assignment have not yet been determined, we want to share more with you about why these moves are necessary. Our highest priority is supporting the health and well-being of our campus community.
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 7,000 students have cancelled their on-campus housing contracts, dramatically reducing our residential population. While we would normally house nearly 9,000 students, the student population on-campus is now approximately 1,200 with an additional 800 people residing in the Family Student Housing complex and in Employee housing.
Students will continue to reside in:
College Nine Residence Halls and Apartments
College Ten Residence Halls and Apartments
Crown Residence Halls and Apartments
Merrill Residence Halls and Apartments
College Apartment communities (with the exception of Porter Bldg F and all Cowell Apartments)
Redwood Grove Apartments
Graduate Housing Apartments
Family Student Housing
Camper Park
Residential areas that will no longer have student residents during Spring 2020:
Porter College Residence Halls and the Transfer Community
Porter College Apartments, Bldg F
Rachel Carson Residence Halls
Oakes College Residence Halls
Cowell College Residence Halls
Cowell College Apartments
Stevenson College Residence Halls
The Village
University Town Center
We fully acknowledge these relocations are stressful and come with a feeling of community loss, and we do not take the decision to make such a requirement lightly. As indicated in your housing agreement, the University maintains the right to assign or reassign you to any university-sponsored residence space that is available. Given the current health crisis, there are many factors contributing to why a relocation is necessary at this time.
Our overarching priority is the safety and well-being of all our students remaining on campus. We plan to relocate students to promote and increase physical distancing, as described by the state and county stay in place orders, while also making sure we have staff available to support the needs of our residential community.
As we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we want to ensure we have space available to help in our response.
Supporting the health of our residential community: We are establishing space on campus where UCSC students and employees may be quarantined or isolated should they become ill. These spaces will be held at the Village, the University Town Center, and Cowell College apartments. Because students in quarantine or isolation have a need for a private residence and private bathroom, we need to have available the ability to utilize all three of these communities for our own campus community needs. We do not wish to have students sharing residential space where another student who is ill may be placed next door to isolate.
Supporting our community:Given the evolving nature of this pandemic and its profound impact on local communities, we are working with the county and other agencies to identify community space needs. The entire UC system is working with their local communities to identify partnerships that support public health needs during this pandemic. We feel this is best for our community, and the broader Santa Cruz community’s needs, to make available completely vacated buildings which is why we cannot continue to have students in residence in these locations.
Additional factors include:
Ensuring quality service:Given the significant reduction in available custodial staffing due to COVID-19, localizing residence hall students within the four designated colleges allows us to more effectively deploy the limited custodial resources currently available.
Providing appropriate staff support:We are better able to effectively staff our housing communities and provide safety and security for our students in consolidated locations.
What are the ways in which we will coordinate this relocation effort?
Students with disability-related accommodations will have their accommodation honored in their new assignment.
Students in Cowell College apartments will have priority to relocate to the Stevenson Apartments. Students in Porter Building F will have priority placement in other Porter Apartments.
Students in college residence halls will have the ability to move to the apartments in their college should they wish to do so. For example, Porter Residence Hall students will be given the opportunity to move to the Porter Apartments. Students who move from the residence halls to the apartments will not have a required meal plan, though they certainly may opt to purchase a meal plan of their choice. If you are currently living in a residence hall and wish to move to the apartments, please contact your Housing Coordinator.
Students who wish to or need to remain in a residence hall facility will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College or Merrill College.
All students will be assigned to private rooms but charged at the triple room rate.
Relocation assistance, including moving vans for distant travel, boxes, tape, labels, etc. will be provided.
Students who submit their Intent to Vacate and complete their move-out (i.e. remove all belongings and return any university keys) by April 19 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Anyone who is still in residence after this date should plan to be reassigned to a new residential location.
As a reminder, the county health directive instructs that public and private gatherings outside of an immediate household are prohibited. An immediate household is not all residents who may reside in a building together, in a community together or even in close proximity. Your immediate household is defined as your private bedroom. We are intentionally assigning students to single occupancy rooms in order to safely practice physical distancing. Guests will not be permitted to visit within a student’s residence.
Because it will take a bit of time for all residences to be vacated and prepared for new occupancy, we are uncertain of the exact date/time of your move. You will receive, in advance of any move, specific instructions related to your relocation.
It is not our intention to add undue burden or stress on any of our students, and hope that you understand why these changes are necessary. Should you be experiencing any distress, support is available for you from CAPS, College Student Life staff, or Slug Support.

Santa Cruz County has announced the temporary closure of all public parks, trails, trailheads and beaches from 11:59 p.m. April 8 to April 15. This new order is a supplement to the county’s existing shelter-in-place order. 
The county’s order specifies that the following facilities and recreation areas are to be closed to the public as of April 8, 2020 and extending through April 15, 2020:
All public trails, paths, parkways, trailheads, and campgrounds.


All public beaches, piers and beach pedestrian or bike paths that traverse the beach.


All public parks and recreation areas, including but not limited to dog parks, skate parks, pump tracks, playgrounds, golf courses, disc golf courses, pickleball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts and other public sports and recreation areas, as well as any picnic or canopy areas within such places used for congregation.

UC Santa Cruz is posting signage at its locations to remind the public of this new county order. 
Wearing face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19
New guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health recommends wearing cloth face coverings when leaving home for essential travel (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory “droplets” with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz county and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.
In accordance with the CDC and California Department of Public Health guidance, we strongly encourage the campus community to use face coverings when in public settings, conducting essential work on campus, or entering campus dining facilities or other environments in which it may be difficult to maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people. 
Reusable cloth face coverings can be made from readily available items such as scarves, bandanas, or neck gaiters, as well as fitted masks that can be made at home or obtained online.

CDC: Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19


Surgeon General Shows How to Make Your Own Face Covering


UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings. Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.
Managers and supervisors should review this information with all essential employees who are physically on site, including those who visit the work site periodically. For employees and tasks that require close contact with others (less than 6 feet), contact EH&S at ehs@ucsc.edu for a workplace assessment and potential risk minimization support, including protective equipment. 
Remember to shelter in place unless leaving home for essential tasks. Use frequent handwashing, maintain at least a 6 foot distance between you and others when engaging in essential activities in public, and wear a face covering to protect each other. Working together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. 
The safety and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty is of the utmost importance, and we will continue to dedicate unified efforts to protect our campus community. If you have any questions, please email the Office of Emergency Services at oes@ucsc.edu.

UC Santa Cruz will continue remote delivery of instruction through Summer Session 2020. Given what we know now, remote instruction is our best choice for the summer ahead. We are confident this transition will go well, especially after the hard work, dedication, and innovation that has been put into winter and spring quarter’s fast changes.  
We will offer more than 300 summer classes, completely remote. We’re adding more summer classes to support unmet spring demand, and the small number of courses that cannot be taught remotely are being removed. Over the next few weeks, Summer Session will make changes to its website. The Schedule of Classes will be finalized by April 24.
Enrollment opens May 1 at 12:00 a.m. in my.ucsc.edu as planned for all summer classes. 
Financial aid will continue to be available to eligible students, and summer grant estimates are available through their online grant calculator.

UCSC transit driver tests positive for COVID-19

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
UC Santa Cruz was notified late Saturday that an employee who works in Transportation and Parking Services as a campus shuttle driver tested positive for COVID-19. Our thoughts are with this employee and their family. We wish them a quick recovery.
Because the campus shuttle program is a public facing activity that provides services for students, faculty, and staff, we believe there is a need to inform our community about this case. The employee drove the loop route on April 1 and 2 and has not been on campus since then. Transit records indicate that approximately 19 people rode the driver’s bus route over the course of the two days; identities of the passengers are unknown.
We believe this case presents a low risk of exposure to our campus community based on the protocols we instituted on March 17, 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19: campus shuttle passengers use only the rear entrance of a bus to enter and exit the bus; passengers are separated by at least six feet from the bus driver; and buses are cleaned several times throughout the day by TAPS staff.
In accordance with guidance provided by the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency, exposed individuals may already have symptoms or may develop symptoms through April 16, 2020. Students who rode the shuttle on April 1 or 2, and have any symptoms or concerns, can call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 to schedule a telephone visit for risk assessment and possible testing for COVID-19. Faculty or staff who rode the shuttle and have symptoms or concerns should contact their healthcare provider and inform them of any possible exposure and/or symptoms to determine appropriate next steps.
The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. Remember to stay home as much as possible, maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from others, and wear a face covering in public. Also, frequent hand washing with soap and water remains an effective tool in minimizing COVID-19 exposure from surfaces. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.
The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community.

Effective April 16, 2020, the Santa Cruz County Health Officer lifted the supplemental order that previously had closed and prohibited the use of specific recreational spaces. The campus adopted these restrictions and applied them to multiple campus locations. Although the supplemental order has been lifted by the County, the original restrictions listed in the extended County Public Health Order dated March 31, 2020 are still in effect.  
Be advised that the campus is lifting some access and location restrictions while still maintaining closures of some locations. This decision is to address areas where group gatherings may occur or areas where we have had challenges with people practicing effective physical distancing. Additionally, playground and other recreational equipment has been included due to the challenges of ensuring adequate sanitization of equipment. These restrictions will be in place until the campus determines it is appropriate to reopen these locations. We will continue to monitor and reassess these decisions based on community practices. 
Closure signs (in English and Spanish) are being adjusted based on the list of spaces that will remain closed as noted below. Other areas may be closed or opened without further notice.

We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 quarter, and we want to share as much information with you as possible while we observe the progress of the current pandemic.

Similar to universities around the world, we are developing plans and making critical decisions about the coming 2020-21 academic year. We recognize that the situation is dynamic and evolving, and we will provide updated information as decisions are made.

Decisions about remote vs. in-person instruction
Currently, we intend for the fall quarter to start as scheduled. We are monitoring the local and state public health situation to determine when and to what degree we can resume in-person instruction. Some or all instruction for a portion or all of the 2020-21 academic year may be delivered via remote and/or online instruction as conditions dictate. At this point we do not know exactly when these decisions can be made because the public health situation remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall quarter as soon as there is adequate information to do so. The health and safety of our students, staff, and faculty is our top priority.

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction continues to be offered remotely for any part of the 2020-21 academic year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and many charges for student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising. While we acknowledge that our campus, like other UC campuses, has changed aspects of our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover continue as we maintain operations and prepare for the recovery to full operations.

Student housing for fall 2020
Given the uncertainty of the ongoing public health crisis and the related decision about the manner of instruction for fall quarter, we want to provide you as much information as we can to help you make the best decision for you and your family. It is possible we will not be able to honor guaranteed housing for continuing students. More information will be shared as it becomes available.

I thank you for your understanding and patience during these challenging times. We will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the fall quarter and we are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible.

UC Santa Cruz continues to address the challenges created by COVID-19. I want to thank everyone in our campus community for their patience during this difficult time. Public health continues to be our top priority. The changes to our campus operations have been implemented with a goal of keeping our campus community as safe as possible, while still ensuring our students have access to the knowledge and expertise that comes with a UC Santa Cruz education even though the method of delivery has adapted.
I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty that has become part of our daily life and the impact it has on our students, staff, and faculty. The members of our campus community are having to juggle campus responsibilities, family needs, and a host of other issues. Our campus has counseling resources to help employees and students who are in need. 
Our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be ongoing and adapt based on public health considerations, and guidance from the state, county, and other agencies. 
Updated county shelter-in-place order
Santa Cruz County announced yesterday that it is extending its shelter in place order and that it will remain in effect until further notice. The county also added more essential activities and essential businesses that will be allowed to operate under the order under certain conditions. The revised order takes effect at 11:59 p.m. today (Friday, May 1). I encourage all of you to read the order to see how it impacts your individual situation.
UC Santa Cruz continues to be defined in the order as an essential business, and activities we undertake for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential activities are allowed, provided that people wear face coverings and that physical distancing of six-feet between persons is maintained to the greatest extent possible. There are new protocols outlined in the order regarding physical distancing and we are working to ensure we are in compliance. We are also reviewing the various aspects of the order to determine if there are any additional adjustments needed to our operations. The Office of Emergency Services will continue to provide Social Distancing Protocols as outlined in the order and COVID-19 safety signs for building principals to post at each main entrance. Managers and supervisors shall ensure signage has been posted or disseminated.  
Our operations at the Silicon Valley Campus are governed by orders issued by Santa Clara County.  We will work with leaders at that location to ensure that they are in compliance with the new orders issued by Santa Clara county earlier this week. 
Both the Santa Cruz and Santa Clara orders contain face covering requirements. For the UCSC locations, this includes wearing a face cover when:
interacting in person with any member of the public


working in any space visited by members of the public


working or walking through common areas, e.g. hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities


preparing food for distribution


in close proximity to others


waiting for or riding in public transit


driving public transit, with or without passengers


There are a limited set of situations in which someone does not need to wear a face covering, such as while driving a car alone or working in an office alone, so long the public does not regularly visit the room.
Outdoor spaces
Earlier this month, UC Santa Cruz lifted some access and location restrictions while still maintaining closures of other locations. We have further adjusted our restrictions to now allow access to trails. It is critical that we prevent the spread of COVID-19, so the campus has decided that the following locations will remain with restricted or closed access.
Coastal Science Campus (limited access to campus, coastal trail accessible)


Westside Research Park (2300 Delaware Ave.)


Workout area near Police Department (Lot 105)

Quarry Amphitheater


Family Student Housing Softball Field


Playgrounds at: Family Student Housing, Ranch View Terrace, Hagar Court


Rachel Carson College: Tennis Courts, Basketball Courts and adjacent grass area


Oakes College: Lower West Field 


Although campus trails are now accessible, restrictions remain in effect for areas where group gatherings may occur or areas where we have had challenges with people practicing physical distancing as provided in the county order. Additionally, access to playgrounds and other recreational equipment has been restricted due to the challenges of ensuring adequate sanitization of equipment. These restrictions will be in place until the campus determines it is appropriate to reopen these locations. We will continue to monitor and reassess these decisions based on state and local guidance.

Share this story:TwitterFacebookLinkedInReddit
Dear Campus Community,
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed into law in early April provides UC Santa Cruz with $19.3 million to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic on the university and its students. At least half of the institution’s allocation will go directly to students via the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office (FASO) to help with expenses related to COVID-19, including costs for housing, food, course materials, technology, health care, and childcare. The remainder of the funding will mitigate unexpected university costs associated with transitioning to remote instruction and remote work, as well as loss of revenue associated with housing, among others.
The emergency financial aid grants will be advanced directly to undergraduates and graduate students with the most need for their expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses.   
In determining the principles for allocation of CARES Act grants, the FASO consulted with campus leaders, including the Student Union Assembly (SUA) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA), on how best to award funds within the Department of Education regulations. We chose not to require an additional application to ensure we can streamline the awarding process. Graduate students who have submitted a FAFSA to UCSC anytime since 2005 were considered eligible. Spring quarter awards will range from $500 to $1,400. Students identified for an award will receive an email in the next few days to ensure they have direct deposit set up. A few days later, the awards will be disbursed. In addition, CARES Act grant-eligible students who enroll in 6 or more credits in summer session will receive $500. These are one-time grant awards that do not need to be paid back. 
The campus will also provide awards aligned with the same principles and priorities to students who have submitted the California Dream Application. 
Any student (resident, international, out of state, undocumented, with or without a financial aid application, etc.) experiencing a financial emergency is encouraged to contact Slug Support.
Our thoughts are with all members of the UC Santa Cruz community as together we face the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hope that you stay safe, stay well and stay connected.",Santa Cruz

Budget Impacts and Uncertainty

There are a number of factors that will contribute to the fiscal impacts on our campus and California as a result of COVID-19. We do not yet know what kinds of instruction will be possible in the fall; we cannot forecast with any certainty how our operations will look as we start our next academic year; and we do not yet know our fall enrollments. The state budget for the next fiscal year and the associated investment in the University of California will not be known until at least September. This period of budget uncertainty and concerns about revenue losses will likely continue beyond the 2020-21 academic year. In addition, depending on the future trajectory of COVID-19 and the potential for resurgence, there could be additional waves of impact. In order to prepare for a variety of scenarios that could emerge, we are deeply engaged in developing plans that provide good fiscal, public health, and safety stewardship and will continue to develop, refine and share these plans as information becomes available.

Workforce Planning

This high degree of budget uncertainty has led to concern about layoffs. As you know, President Naplitano and the 10 campus Chancellors sent out a communication in March stating a commitment to no COVID-19 related layoffs through the rest of the current fiscal year. At this point we do not have enough budget information to say definitively what may happen in regard to layoffs after July 1, 2020. I know this message does not bring reassurance, but I offer it in the spirit of transparency. Many have asked if voluntary pay cuts or similar actions could be implemented to minimize the potential for layoffs or other budget cuts. All of these possibilities are on the table. We are working with the Office of the President and the other UC campuses to coordinate efforts to address potential budget shortfalls.

CARES Act Funding

Universities and colleges are receiving limited federal funding to assist with the fiscal impact of COVID-19. Through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, UC Santa Cruz has been allocated $19.3 million. Federal guidelines state that these funds must go toward expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus. One-half of these funds must be awarded directly to students in the form of emergency financial aid grants. Students will receive a follow-up email explaining this process. The remaining half (approximately $9.6M) are to cover costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction. Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, working with the academic leadership team, will recommend how these funds should be directed per federal guidelines. I share with others the hope that there will be additional COVID-19 federal legislation, but it is not yet clear what kinds of financial relief will come to the University of California or UC Santa Cruz. The campus is also tracking all expenses for other kinds of support, through agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Planning for Recovery

Though we face uncertainty about many elements of our operations, we are actively engaging in planning to identify how we can and should respond based on various scenarios. As part of this work, I have asked the campus leadership team to think through how their operations and finances would be impacted by various scenarios including permanent campus budget reductions of 5, 10 and 15 percent. I have also asked them to identify the opportunities for revenue generation or other operational efficiencies that could mitigate possible budget cuts. We are developing a set of principles to guide this work so that our mission and goals continue to guide our budget decisions. We will share information about these principles as this work continues.

Recovery and Resiliency Committee Structure

Scenario planning is the basis for the recovery and resiliency work moving forward in response to COVID-19. The health and safety of our campus community is our top priority in this work. I have appointed a Recovery and Resiliency Steering Committee to guide the work of the two task forces.

The first task force is focused on Academic Recovery and Resiliency, and is chaired by Lori Kletzer. The focus of this group is identifying the possible modalities of our teaching, learning, and research, and related student affairs, housing and residential life operations for the coming 2020-21 academic year.  

The second task force is focused on Operations and Employee Recovery and Resiliency, and is chaired by Vice Chancellor for Business and Administration Sarah Latham. The focus of this group is on community and morale, how we return to work, how people navigate the fears and uncertainties of returning to work, and how we leverage opportunities that have emerged over the last couple of months. This work includes identifying how we can return to work safely and the many issues that relate to resumption of business. As these groups identify recommendations, I have asked them to share information with the campus community.

I know this period of isolation and uncertainty is difficult. I encourage you to continue to seek out new methods for connecting with your peers, colleagues and co-workers. Additionally, the Employee Assistance Program is available to all faculty and staff. Based on your feedback, our Staff Human Resources team is actively working to expand the number of sessions available via this program. We have also launched a webpage that outlines other resources available to you in support of wellbeing and mental health during the COVID19 pandemic.

Thank you again for all you are doing to support UC Santa Cruz.

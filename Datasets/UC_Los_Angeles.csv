23-Jan-20,318,Los Angeles,"To the UCLA Community, As we approach the peak of the flu season, many of you may be experiencing flu-like symptoms or the common cold.  In addition, you may have come across news reports about a similar respiratory illness from Wuhan, China, called the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. While incidences of the common cold or the flu may be on the rise, we want to reassure the UCLA community that at this time, there are no known exposures to 2019-nCoV on campus. Additionally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to people in North America is considered low. We would also like to remind the Bruin community that there are simple precautions one can take to minimize the risk of contracting or spreading any respiratory viral illnesses. Those include regular hand-washing, coughing and sneezing into one’s sleeves, and staying up-to-date on immunizations and flu shots. The UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health Center and UCLA Health infectious disease specialists recommend that any student experiencing a cough and a fever who has also recently traveled to Wuhan, or who has had contact with people from Wuhan with symptoms, call the center at (310) 206-6217. Students must call before showing up. UCLA faculty and staff in the same situation should contact their primary health care provider. Both the Arthur Ashe Student Health Center and the UCLA Health hospitals are well-prepared to care for patients with infectious diseases. UCLA is also working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and state and county public health officials to keep our campus healthy, and to keep you informed of significant new developments. More information about the coronavirus may be found at the CDC site. Information is also available at the World Health Organization. Dr. Daniel Uslan Clinical Chief of Infectious Diseases UCLA Health Dr. Nancy Holt Co-Executive Director, Interim Arthur Ashe Student Health Center"
31-Jan-20,434,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community, As news coverage of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues, we wanted to update you on UCLA’s response and preparedness efforts to keep the Bruin community safe. We also want to reassure you that there are currently no known exposures to 2019-nCoV on our campus or in UCLA Health hospitals and clinics. UCLA campus and health leaders, working in close partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control, continue to monitor the situation closely and take measures to ensure the health and safety of the Bruin community. The new virus has caused understandable anxiety and concern, particularly in light of yesterday’s decision by the U.S. State Department has raised its travel advisory to level 4 for China (Do Not Travel) and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has requested all UC campuses to avoid all non-essential travel to China. Please also keep in mind, however, that there have been only two confirmed cases in Southern California, and the CDC believes that the risk to the general public is low. UCLA Health and the Ashe Student Health Center have highly-trained physicians, nurses and staff who are fully prepared to treat infectious diseases at UCLA. We also take this opportunity to remind you that, while the vast majority of the infections have occurred in Wuhan, China, we must not stigmatize anyone in our community based on their national origin. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus. Please also remember that the same standard health practices recommended to prevent the spread of influenza can also be used to prevent coronavirus, including: Remaining home if you are ill and being particularly careful to avoid large events and crowded areas Regularly and thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water Coughing and sneezing into your sleeve Staying up-to-date on immunizations and flu shots The UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health Center and UCLA Health infectious disease specialists recommend that any student experiencing a cough and a fever who has also recently traveled to Wuhan, or who has had contact with people from Wuhan with symptoms, call the center at (310) 206-6217. Students must call before showing up. UCLA faculty and staff in the same situation should contact their primary health care provider. For daily updates on the coronavirus, please visit the CDC site.

4-Feb-20,402,Los Angeles,"Dear Colleagues: UCLA has developed a review and approval process to provide guidance to faculty and staff considering travel to China, in light of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. This comes as the U.S Department of State last week raised its travel advisory for China to its maximum level, urging U.S. citizens not to travel there due to the public health concerns posed by 2019-nCoV. Commercial airlines have also reduced or suspended routes to and from China, and late last week University of California President Janet Napolitano requested all UC campuses to temporarily “avoid all non-essential travel” to China (PDF). The UC Office of the President also asked all UC campuses to develop a review and approval process to determine whether travel to China is essential or can be postponed. While the UC restrictions apply only to university-related travel, those traveling for personal reasons should be mindful of travel risks and the federal government’s advisory. UCLA faculty and staff may send questions to info@irm.ucla.edu, a dedicated email account that is monitored by the UCLA Office of Insurance and Risk Management, and the central point of contact for questions about UCLA-related China travel restrictions specifically. APPROVAL PROCESS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF PRIOR TO TRAVEL In light of UC’s directive to avoid all non-essential travel, faculty or staff who would like to engage in essential travel to China will need to obtain prior approval. For faculty, essential travel is defined as that which is required to: preserve the safety of a research subject and which is not possible to be postponed; or preserve the results of a research activity and which is not possible to be postponed. Please be aware that educational conferences are not considered essential travel, even if you are a presenter. This is just one example of non-essential travel and does not include all other activities that would also be considered non-essential travel. To request approval to engage in essential travel, faculty should contact their deans in writing for approval. For staff: All staff must request an exemption as university-related staff travel to China is presumed postponable and therefore non-essential. To request an exception, staff should contact their department’s vice chancellor in writing. Such an exemption may only be approved by a vice chancellor. For more information about our campus plans for coronavirus preparedness, please visit the UCLA Bruins Safe Online website. Sincerely, Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost"
20-Feb-20,370,Los Angeles,"Dear Bruins: I am writing to advise on international travel plans in light of the global health concerns over the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). As we make plans for the upcoming spring break, I urge you to please keep in mind recent advisories by the U.S. State Department urging people not to travel to China in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the directive by the University of California Office of the President to avoid all non-essential travel to China. This is a difficult time for anyone planning or considering travel to China and other affected countries, especially for those hoping to visit family, or those who have long-awaited or time-sensitive travel plans. The severity of the outbreak has resulted in many extraordinary restrictions, including multiple commercial airlines suspending travel to China. If you plan on traveling outside of the United States, keep in mind that other countries could add or change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions or quarantines could be imposed when returning to the United States. If you must travel outside the United States for spring break, please consider obtaining travel insurance — which is available through the UC Office of the President Travel Insurance website or the provider of your choice — and be sure to provide family and friends with your contact information. UCLA Residence halls will remain open over spring break for current residents unable to travel home. For students who would like additional guidance and information about travel restrictions and planning, please visit Bruins Safe Online. For students facing the emotional aspects of their travel decisions, such as worrying about family in the affected area or not being able to visit home, please contact UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services. We are here for you. Please also remember that even though the vast majority of the infections have occurred in Wuhan, China, we must not stigmatize anyone in our community based on appearance or national origin. Someone who has a cough or fever does not necessarily have COVID-19, although the same standard health practices recommended to prevent the spread of influenza can also be used to prevent COVID-19. For more information on these precautions and to learn more about UCLA’s preparedness, please visit the UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health & Wellness Center website. Sincerely, Monroe Gorden Vice Chancellor Student Affairs"

2-Mar-20,402,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: Ongoing news about the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is understandably creating concern and, although the risk to the general public is low, we wanted to keep you current on the latest information. While there have been no reported cases at UCLA so far, I want to remind you of some standard health practices that can prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands Avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are sick Cover your cough or sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash There is currently no need to cancel classes or other events and UCLA continues to closely coordinate with federal, state and local public health officials so that our campus remains fully prepared. If you are considering travel, please also be sure to stay up to date on the latest travel advisories, which currently recommend avoiding nonessential travel to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Also keep in mind that other countries can always add or change travel restrictions, flights may be canceled, and new re-entry restrictions or quarantines could be imposed. Please be sure to provide family and friends with your itinerary and contact information before you travel. If you develop flu-like symptoms  fever, cough and difficulty breathing  and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. I know that anxieties can run high, but please avoid panic and stay educated. UCLA will continue to provide you with the most reliable and up-to-date information possible on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) information page on UCLA Newsroom. We are also planning some upcoming forums to share information about our planning and preparedness, particularly for our students. Communities thrive when we all stay committed to each other’s well-being. We must never stigmatize anyone in our community based on national origin. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have COVID-19. Science and common sense remain our best tools for successfully addressing this situation. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
4-Mar-20,635,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: As you may have seen, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced this morning that there are additional confirmed cases of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Los Angeles County. Given this news, I wanted to provide continued updates knowing this may cause anxiety among our Bruin community. First, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UCLA at this time. Second, we are working quickly to expand the use of existing remote teaching and learning tools available, by reaching out to faculty to offer technology support. These tools will include the ability to stream lectures via Zoom or BruinCast, create collaborative online spaces via Slack or UCLA Common Collaboration and Learning Environment (CCLE) and provide opportunities for remote test taking, if needed. There will be a separate message to faculty with more details. Also, we will begin to offer in-person informational meetings, starting today. Understanding that there is a lot of news and misinformation regarding COVID-19, we will host community meetings during which attendees can hear the facts about COVID-19 from medical experts, understand UCLA’s procedures for handling different scenarios and have an open forum to ask questions. We will hold these in-person informational meetings at various locations on campus, including on the Hill. Information concerning these meetings will be listed on the COVID-19 information page on UCLA Newsroom. For departments interested in coordinating a small group meeting, please contact UCLA Campus Human Resources at 310-794-0860. And lastly, as I shared in my message earlier this week, the best steps you can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include washing your hands frequently, containing coughs into a tissue or sleeve and staying home if you are sick, especially if you have a respiratory illness and fever. If you develop flu-like symptoms  fever, cough and difficulty breathing  and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. As always, emergency preparedness information can be found at Bruins Safe Online. We will continue to communicate regularly on this important topic. I know concerns may be high, and please know that the health and safety of our Bruin community is our top priority. I thank you for taking care of yourselves and each other. Sincerely, Gene D. Block"
5-Mar-20,223,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: We are writing to share updated travel guidance, given that the prevalence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States and internationally is changing rapidly. For international travel: UCLA prohibits official university travel to all regions with Level 3 Travel Warnings for coronavirus from the CDC: mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. We strongly discourage personal travel to jurisdictions with Level 3 Travel Warnings. Any traveler arriving from these areas must self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left that country, in accordance with new guidance from the CDC. (This provision is retroactive to the last 14 days.) These requirements will also be imposed for any region the CDC raises to Level 3 for the coronavirus in the coming weeks. UCLA discourages all other nonessential international travel for now. If you decide to travel, be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. If you need to travel internationally: Consider obtaining travel insurance through the UC Office of the President Travel Insurance website or the provider of your choice. Stay informed about developments in your destination by monitoring the travel guidance provided by the CDC. Make sure your family and friends are aware of your plans and how to reach you. For domestic travelers: Use caution and judgment before any domestic travel, and check for the latest information before your trip. For large conferences and events: We are following the guidance of health officials and there is currently no recommendation to avoid attending large conferences on campus. However, we still urge you to use caution and judgment if you decide to attend large conferences. For incoming visitors to campus: Any visitor arriving to campus from a Level 3 jurisdiction (currently mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran), must also follow the CDC guidelines to self-isolate for 14 days since the date they left that country. This also applies to visitors who have been invited to campus by UCLA groups and programs. UCLA is taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Examples include: Installing hand sanitizer stations across campus, and in university-provided housing and dining area entries and on BruinBuses Cleaning restrooms and public areas with anti-viral, anti-bacterial chemical solutions Increasing frequency of cleaning in residential and dining area high-touch surfaces Employing electrostatic sprayer systems in high-use areas to disinfect around curved and hard-to-reach surfaces We want to reiterate that you can prevent the spread of COVID-19 by taking other precautions like washing your hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds, containing coughs into a tissue or sleeve, and staying home if you are sick, especially if you have a respiratory illness and fever. If you develop flu-like symptoms fever, cough and difficulty breathing and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. We encourage you to visit the COVID-19 information page on UCLA Newsroom, which is frequently updated with the latest guidance and resources. As always, emergency preparedness information and resources can be found at Bruins Safe Online. We will continue to work closely with public health officials and provide updates and community information sessions. Please also remember that UCLA is an inclusive and welcoming community, and we must not stigmatize anyone based on appearance or national origin. We recognize that there are concerns among the campus community and we remain grateful for the calm and thoughtful manner in which Bruins are caring for themselves and each other.

6-Mar-20,495,Los Angeles,"We learned tonight that three UCLA students are being tested for COVID-19 by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH). All three students are self-isolating off campus. To be clear, no one on the UCLA campus has tested positive for COVID-19. LACDPH has committed to expediting these tests for UCLA. As soon as we learn the results, we will inform you of any campus impacts. Understandably, some of you may be wondering about the status of classes and campus operations in general. We are actively monitoring and responding to the situation and will continue to follow the guidance of public health agencies. At this time, there have been no recommendations by LACDPH to suspend campus operations, including modifying class schedules. While situations like these often create uncertainty and concern, please be assured that the safety and well-being of the entire UCLA community remains our top priority, and we will continue to provide you with the most reliable and up-to-date information possible on UCLA’s COVID-19 website.

6-Mar-20,241,Los Angeles,"Dear Colleagues: In preparation for possible transition of classes to alternative delivery modalities as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, we want to share with you some tools that are available to support academic continuity. UCLA has invested in additional software licenses and other technology that will aid you and your students to continue your instruction and learning. Please anticipate and prepare for the possibility that you may have to provide alternatives for access to lectures, discussion sections, office hours, remaining assignments, and final exams. A campus working group, chaired by Special Assistant for Online Initiatives and Professor of History Jan Reiff, has developed a resource document to assist faculty, including Geffen Academy teachers, to move instruction to an online environment should classes be disrupted by the impacts of COVID-19. While it does not cover all circumstances, nor does it apply to all classes, it does provide potential solutions to situations that might arise. The tools will also be available during the Spring quarter or during other circumstances when you or your students may not be able to attend class in person. Some of the tools we recommend include: Zoom, to let your students watch your lectures in real time, participate in discussion sections and review sessions, and work with other members of their project teams. We have procured additional licenses and made it easier to download the application and set it up. A limited number of laptops and iPads are available to loan to faculty who do not currently have equipment that supports Zoom or other online collaboration tools, and are not able to obtain them through their department or borrow from a colleague.

10-Mar-20,759,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: Like many of you, I have been carefully following news about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We have been working around the clock with other campus leaders and public health officials to consider how it has and could continue to impact our students, faculty and staff and developing plans for every possible scenario. While there are no confirmed cases at UCLA at this time, I believe that it is important for communities to look out for one another and to do what is best for our global and UCLA communities. This is why, after detailed and thoughtful discussion, consultation with experts, and planning and preparation, we have decided to enact the following changes to limit the spread of COVID-19, effective tomorrow, March 11: We will suspend in-person classes wherever possible and transition to online platforms through April 10, which is the end of the second week of Spring Quarter. Winter Quarter final exams will be offered remotely. Instructors are asked to communicate with students how final exams, if applicable, will be offered without the need to assemble in person (for example, take home, online or other alternative formats). Students are encouraged to start the Spring Quarter remotely from home. University housing will remain open through Spring Break and beyond for those who need it. We’re transitioning over the next few days to cancel nonessential gatherings of more than 100 people. Campus remains open, including housing, hospitals, clinics and research laboratories. We will be in touch before April 10 as facts change and we reevaluate these plans. If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, reach out to your department chair or dean. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, building on our plan for academic continuity. If you are an employee, please contact your manager and further guidance will be forthcoming. Please continue to check UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website for updates. I know this raises a lot of questions about courses, like performance courses, that are difficult to teach remotely and, for our staff who support campus operations, what their roles will look like. We understand there will be questions around many issues. Please be assured that answers and additional information will be forthcoming over the next few days. Our new policy regarding nonessential in-person events with more than 100 people will mean that organizers must work toward canceling conferences and large events through April 10. Attendance at all UCLA Athletics home events will be largely spectator-free through April 10 and limited to individuals essential to safely and effectively managing events. I know these changes may cause some stress and uncertainty. Please bear with us while we manage this complicated transition. Counseling services are available for students through UCLA’s Counseling and Psychological Services. Staff and faculty may seek services at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. If you develop flu-like symptoms — fever, cough and difficulty breathing  and are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, seek medical attention. Students should call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 and faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. Students: I know you will miss your friends and all of the activities you enjoy on campus. I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation, flexibility and academic integrity during this time. Please read more online about resources available to you. Faculty: I know these transitions will require you to transform how you deliver instruction and conduct final exams. Please know that we will work to provide the support and training you need to make this change as smooth as possible. Watch the Academic Senate homepage for further guidance. Staff: Please work with your supervisors to be flexible in these uncertain times and know that additional information about business continuity will be provided. You can find the UC Office of the President updated leave policy (PDF) online. And, finally, for our entire community, please also remember that COVID-19 is clearly going to disrupt and change our schedules, habits and lives for the foreseeable future. This will not be a perfect transition; however, it will not change who we are and what we do. It will also never compromise UCLA’s impact in our community and the broader world. How we react and work together in times like these help define who we are, and I have no doubt that the Bruin community will once again rise to the occasion as we transition to our second century. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
12-Mar-20,1260,Los Angeles,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Student Employees: As a follow up to Tuesday’s memo from Chancellor Block regarding UCLA’s transition to remote instruction through, at minimum, April 10 due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we want to share leave policies and other support services that are available to employees, including the option of remote work. Our decision to make these dramatic shifts was motivated by our concerns for everyone’s safety. The best way to limit the spread of COVID-19 or any contagious disease, according to health experts, is to reduce community density. Remaining six feet away from others, wherever possible, can help prevent infections transmitted by an uncovered cough or sneeze and also by touching a contaminated surface. UCLA’s decision to transition to remote classes, postpone or cancel large events and reduce the number of people in dining facilities and residential buildings will help reduce the risk of the virus spreading on campus and in the broader community. Employees should remain home if they are sick to protect themselves and their colleagues. As always, we encourage you to be mindful of employees’ health needs. While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the UCLA campus at this time, we are committed to the safety and welfare of our employees and hope this administrative guidance will be useful to departments and organizations as we all work to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Campus Remains Open Even though classes are transitioning to remote learning temporarily, the campus remains open for students unable to return home. It is important to keep in mind that research, health care, remote learning support, as well as business and operational support functions, will continue. Recognizing we are undergoing an immense transition in the way we currently deliver educational services, this requires that all of us work together through this period of change and uncertainty. Remote Work Provisions As campus remains open, we need to maintain business continuity to support campus needs, particularly during transitional periods. Departments are encouraged to develop business continuity plans that will identify where remote work opportunities are operationally feasible. UCLA Telecommuting Guidelines are helpful in understanding the review and approval process for employees and managers to follow. Some employees can telecommute, others could telecommute if equipment is available and others cannot telecommute given their job functions. Respective deans, vice provosts and vice chancellors are responsible for ensuring business continuity and approval of plans that involve telecommuting. We know there are going to be varied outcomes for staff based on these departmental business continuity plans. For example, most if not all health care workers and direct services employees will need to be on campus. Additionally, the way in which departments implement their plans could change day to day or week to week, depending on shifting conditions and departmental needs. These are unprecedented times, so we greatly appreciate your flexibility and understanding. The University has enacted the following temporary actions for leave if an employee is directly impacted by COVID-19: Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g., sick leave, PTO-sick or other accrued leave). If there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances, and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-19 day-care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if their department determines that it is operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use all available leave balances, including sick leave and vacation. Departments may designate certain positions to work from home if operationally feasible. If employees are approved to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work, as determined by the department in consultation with Employee & Labor Relations, may be allowed up to 14 days of paid administrative leave. (Health care workers are considered exempt from this category of designation; please contact UCLA Health Human Resources for further information.) Academic appointees who do not accrue sick and/or vacation leave and who are not otherwise eligible for paid medical leave under applicable provisions of the Academic Personnel Manual will receive up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover absences as described above. (Please contact the Academic Personnel Office for questions regarding academic appointees.) Leave Provisions Additional information regarding applicable leave provisions may be found within the Absence from Work policy (PPSM 2.210) (PDF) that applies to eligible policy-covered staff employees (SMG, MSP and PSS) who may be impacted, including probationary employees. Catastrophic Leave Sharing Program UCLA’s Catastrophic Leave Program is an option for employees who have exhausted their paid leave. It is also available to those staff members who may want to donate vacation hours for others who may need them. Employee Assistance Program Dealing with uncertain situations such as COVID-19 can take a serious toll on all of us. We would like to remind you that the professionals at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for student employees are available to help employees deal with the impact of these circumstances. Pre K-12 Education Please note that the UCLA Lab School and the Geffen Academy are transitioning to alternative teaching and learning. The Early Care and Education programs and centers will remain open and will operate on limited schedules until further notice. You may contact each school or program directly for further information. Travel for Staff and Faculty Effective immediately, all nonessential university-related international and domestic travel is suspended until further notice. Personal international and domestic travel is strongly discouraged given the associated risks of possibly being unable to return if the situation changes. The CDC has recently updated their travel warnings as the spread of COVID-19 continues. Travelers returning from countries designated Level 3 by the CDC are subject to 14-day self-quarantine upon return. If you decide to travel, please be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. To request approval to engage in essential travel, faculty should contact their deans in writing for approval. Similarly, all staff must request an exemption from their vice chancellors in writing. For more information on UCLA travel and other updates, please visit the UCLA COVID-19 page and emergency updates and resources are always available at Bruins Safe Online. During this challenging transitional period, staff plays a critical role in supporting the campus community. We are so grateful for the incredible work of our employees, especially during these difficult times. We also appreciate your continued understanding and flexibility. Our employees should monitor their own health with heightened awareness and stay home if they are sick. The options mentioned above are designed to help keep the entire UCLA community safe and should be used by employees when needed. Please distribute this information to units within your purview. Sincerely, Michael J. Beck Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael S. Levine Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel"
13-Mar-20,203,Los Angeles,"As you may have seen on my Twitter account a short time ago, I wanted to let you know that I am self-quarantining at home for the next 14 days after learning this morning that I came in contact with an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19. While I am currently asymptomatic and continuing my duties running the campus from home, I felt it was important to keep the UCLA community aware and informed. I will continue to keep you updated. As testing for COVID-19 in the United States becomes more widely available, we will see local health centers administer more tests. As a result, we should prepare ourselves to expect the number of self-quarantine cases, like mine, and confirmed cases to increase in the weeks and months ahead  not only across the nation, but also at UCLA. I know there are many of you who are or will be in similar situations. Please know that the entire Bruin community supports you. I know these are uncertain times and many things are changing. Please know that all of our actions are aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 to keep one another safe. Please continue to check UCLA’s COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online regularly for updates. We must always commit to preparation rather than panic. We must also look out for one another, even while we are asked to be apart. Please remember throughout the weeks and months ahead that you are all part of a community that cares about you and remains dedicated to your health and well-being. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
13-Mar-20,1727,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: By this time, you have seen the announcement from Chancellor Block about new campus measures designed to help limit the risk of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on campus. We appreciate your patience as we work thoughtfully to make decisions and adjustments to address the impact of this international public health crisis. Based on the rapidly developing situation and new data every day, we have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely through the end of the spring quarter. As stated by the chancellor, we want to reduce population density on campus because public health officials tell us that this is the best way to limit the spread of COVID-19. To that end, we have encouraged students who can return home to do so, and to take all of their personal items, if possible, from their university-owned housing with them. We also know there are a number of students who will remain on campus and in the local area. Housing and Residential Life will be following up with students who live in university-owned housing with more specific information, including how to request an early contract termination and seek a refund. If, in the meantime, students have concerns or questions, please email Housing directly at uclahousing@housing.ucla.edu. We recognize that there will be courses with specialized equipment or field work that may not be able to be conducted remotely, and more specific information will be shared in the coming days. Also, students on the semester system and/or in clinical programs will receive additional information from their schools/departments. Because remote learning will continue through spring quarter, we ask all faculty and students to familiarize themselves with remote technology features such as Zoom during spring break. Our priority during this crisis is to protect the health and safety of our campus community. Please know that the campus remains open and we are doing everything we can to create a safe environment. This includes deploying hand sanitizer stations and surface wipes across campus, increasing the frequency of cleanings, modifying dining operations and frequently updating the campus community. Our libraries, computer labs, ASUCLA operations and University offices remain open. The facts related to COVID-19 are changing rapidly, so routinely check with UCLA information sources for updates. The most up-to-date information can be found online at UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website and emergency updates and resources are always available at Bruins Safe Online. What follows are answers to some general questions, and an overview of services as we transition to a remote learning environment. Students Is the campus closed? No. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus units, including University-owned housing, the Arthur Ashe Student Health Center, UCLA Recreation, Counseling and Psychological Services, and ASUCLA dining facilities will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified. We will continue to provide updated information. What about classes and exams? We have suspended in-person classes, wherever possible, and are transitioning to remote platforms. Winter and spring quarter finals will be offered remotely; instructors have been asked to communicate with students regarding final examinations. If you are concerned about your ability to participate in remote classes or exams, please contact the Dean of Students Office at 310-825-3894 or dean@saonet.ucla.edu. Should I leave campus? If students are able to leave campus and continue studies remotely, please do so. However, if students remain on campus or live in the local area, University facilities will remain open. How quickly do I need to remove my belongings from campus housing if I leave? Personal items may remain in campus housing through the end of spring quarter or your housing contract term. Students who wish to cancel their housing contracts early will need to remove their personal belongings prior to that cancellation.

14-Mar-20,2111,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the UCLA campus at this time, however, in anticipation of possible community spread, UCLA has suspended in-person classes and transitioned to remote learning platforms through the end of spring quarter. Visit the UCLA COVID-19 site for more information. The focus of this communication is to provide additional guidance regarding your research activities. With the ongoing concern about the spread of COVID-19, laboratories and research facilities should plan for the possibility of significant disruptions in routine operations. Each laboratory or research facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan that will meet its unique needs. This guidance is provided to facilitate the development of your plan, but is not intended to be all-inclusive; it is based on what is known at this time. I will update the research community as the situation develops and more information becomes available. Research Continuity Guidance for Physical Laboratories and Research Facilities Assumptions that you can use for planning, based on a scenario with widespread COVID-19 communal transmission: A significant percentage of your laboratory workforce may be out sick or unable to come to work. Essential research infrastructure, such as power and telecommunications, will be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) and Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) personnel will maintain their essential research support functions, although some lower-priority services may need to be curtailed (e.g., less frequent waste pick-up by EH&S, fewer DLAM-led vivarium walk-throughs and researcher training classes). Orders for critical supplies may be delayed, for example, due to departmental staff absences or supply chain interruptions. Processing of visas by the federal government may be delayed, resulting in delayed appointments. Core facilities and other fee-for-service resources may not be available. Steps you can take now to ensure continuity of critical functions: Identify procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention (e.g., cell culture maintenance, animal studies). Assess and prioritize critical laboratory activities, including care for animals housed in your laboratory. Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed or delayed. For research involving animals, consider delaying animal ordering and imports, and cease or reduce breeding activities. With classes moving to remote instruction through the next quarter, undergraduate student workers are not expected to report for laboratory duties and their tasks should be covered accordingly. Identify personnel able to safely perform essential activities and cross-train research staff to fill in for others who may be out sick or unable to come to work. Communicate any need for DLAM support or technical services promptly. Identify how the viability of laboratories, stored materials, animals, etc. will be monitored and addressed in the event regular staff cannot be there in the normal manner. Ensure that you have emergency contact information for your critical staff, including cell phone numbers; develop a communication plan. Ensure you are documenting critical step-by-step instructions in your Standard Operating Procedures. Coordinate with colleagues who have similar research activities to identify ways to ensure coverage of critical activities. Review and test contingency plans and emergency procedures with researchers and staff. Important considerations for lab work as well as human subjects research contingency plans should focus on maintaining a safe distance between people, which can be accomplished utilizing technology, such as online video/teleconferencing, as an alternative to reduce nonessential in-person interactions. Maintain a sufficient inventory of critical supplies that may be impacted by global shipping delays. Identify and consider your ability to work with limited quantities (or completely without) common perishable items, such as dry ice, liquid nitrogen and various gas cylinders. Communicate significant planned absences and/or lab closures to your EH&S Research Safety representatives, business offices, DLAM and other key administrative units. Prioritize. Depending upon the nature of your research, consider prioritizing work that can only be carried out in your research facility, and put off work amenable to remote support, such as data analysis. Stockpiling results and data now that could be analyzed remotely in the future is a potential option that might create future flexibility. Remote access: Ensure that those involved in research projects have access to information they need to carry out work remotely (e.g., access to literature, computational resources, existing datasets and research-related files, for example using Box and meeting software such as Zoom). Access to Hoffman2 computation and data storage resources, mobile web resources and statistics consultation managed through the Office of Information Technology will continue to be available. Check that any department computational and data storage resources will be available and, if so, ensure remote access. While UCLA Libraries remain open and fully operational, currently scheduled in-class training sessions and requests for new consultations and training sessions may be handled remotely. Review this handout on backing up and protecting research data (PDF). Test and update remote work technologies such as VPN, Box and Zoom conferencing. Ensure that remote access (e.g., the use of a personally owned computer) complies with security and privacy requirements for access and data to safeguard UCLA resources, most especially when data are sensitive or restricted. The UC Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes). Measures you can take to prevent the spread of illness among your group: Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Implement measures to reduce density and allow distancing of lab/research personnel. For example, increasing spacing between researchers where possible to more than 6 feet, having personnel come to the lab in shifts, allowing every other bench to be unoccupied, etc. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Self-isolate and do not travel or go to work or school when you are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze then throw the tissue in the trash. Then wash your hands with soap and water. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in your workplace. Research safety: Safety is critical, and with the potential for unexpected absences, it is important that research activities be left in a safe state daily. Experiments should be left each day in a stable mode such that they do not present any biological, chemical or physical hazards in case of a prolonged absence. Further, experiments must incorporate ""fail-safe"" measures; that is, in the event that a member of the research team is not able to return to the lab the next day, or if there is a failure of air supply, cooling, power, water supply, vacuum or other connection, the experiment should not create hazardous conditions. Outside of active experiments, biological, chemical and radiological materials and equipment must be secured in a safe manner. Physically hazardous equipment (cryogenic, heated, pressurized, under vacuum, etc.) similarly must be maintained in a safe state. Questions and requests for assistance regarding research safety can be addressed to UCLA Environment, Health & Safety: Main Phone: 310-825-5689 EH&S Hotline: 310-825-9797 Biosafety Consultations: biosafety@ehs.ucla.edu Chemical Consultations and Lab Safety: laboratorysafety@ehs.ucla.edu Radiation Safety: 310-825-5396 or radiationsafety@ehs.ucla.edu Request for an experiment safety review Hazardous Waste: 310-206-1887 or hazardousmaterials@ehs.ucla.edu Research continuity summary: Advance planning will allow everyone in your research group to focus on their own efforts and work together as a team, rather than wondering how they and their team members are to proceed. Quick Checklist: Identify critical lab operations. Identify critical lab personnel and ensure they know what to do in the event of suspended operations. Remind lab personnel of your communication plan or create one if not in place. Ensure remote access to files, data, servers, etc. Identify and follow appropriate data back-up and security protocols. Prioritize experiments. Leave experiments in a safe state at the end of each day. Cancel nonessential travel and check travel restrictions before making travel plans. Check UCLA’s updated travel guidance. COVID-19 Research on Campus Under UCLA Policy 992, any research group that plans to conduct research with SARS-CoV-2 must obtain Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval prior to beginning any such research. As part of the IBC review process, a full risk assessment would be conducted to ensure worker safety and agent containment. Travel Please know that all UCLA nonessential international and domestic travel is suspended until further notice and personal international and domestic travel is strongly discouraged. Anyone arriving from CDC Level 3 countries must self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left that country. If you decide to travel, be aware that other countries could change travel restrictions without notice, flights may be canceled or new re-entry restrictions could be imposed when returning to the United States. There are no current restrictions on domestic travel, but you should be aware of preventative measures as you travel domestically. UCLA Research Administration UCLA Research Administration and all of its offices are fully operational and have contingency plans in place to maintain continuity of services even if personnel are working remotely. Our Office of Research Information Services (ORIS) will continue to support our central research administration systems to ensure ongoing operations. The Office of Contract and Grant Administration (OCGA) will continue to review and submit proposals, accept awards, issue sub awards and manage communications with sponsors. Cayuse, EPASS, PI Portal, ORA Resource Center, and other systems will be available as usual. Extramural Fund Management (EFM) will continue to submit financial reports and invoices, process close-outs, manage reimbursements and provide financial management support for grant and contract funds. EFM systems will remain on line in conjunction with the financial systems. We expect federal agencies to continue to provide services, and to be flexible about deadlines as needed in emergency situations. If agencies are officially closed, we will continue to do what we can, understanding that transactions will likely remain in queue until agency operations are resumed. We will continue to work with state, county, city and nonprofit sponsors as possible. Additional information will be posted on the ORA, OCGA and EFM websites as new information is obtained. NSF has developed a new website for the research community with detailed guidance on COVID-19. This includes guidance for awardee organizations, researchers and reviewers of NSF proposals. The Office of the Human Research Protection Program (OHRPP) and the Research Safety & Animal Welfare Administration (RSAWA) will continue to operate as usual, including convening regular meetings of the Institutional Review Boards (IRB), Animal Research Committee (ARC), Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Radiation Safety Committees (RSC). Our WebIRB, RATS, and SafetyNet systems can be accessed anywhere an individual has internet access. Similarly, the OHRPP and RSAWA staff have the capability to conduct faculty committee meetings via Zoom as needed. As a reminder, all changes/modifications to research protocols still need to be reviewed and approved by the relevant oversight committee, except for incorporation of a COVID-19 screening protocol and addition of measures needed to avoid an immediate apparent hazard to a patient/participant. If a research protocol requires modification due to COVID-19 implications, contact OHRPP directly so those submissions can be triaged in an expeditious manner. For any questions or concerns related to your protocols, contact the OHRPP office or RSAWA office. Clinical Research Activities Existing studies that meet the definition of an NIH Clinical Trial (PDF) should proceed if the benefit to study participants outweighs the risks of participation. PIs can reach out to OHRPP staff if they have questions about participant risk and benefit. All research teams are urged to assess study visits with PIs, protocols and sponsors, and assess if visits can be conducted through telephonic or video-conferenced methods without increased risk or compromise of safety of research subjects; otherwise, research participants should come to UCLA for their study visits just as they would for routine clinical care. Study team-participant interaction should be restricted only to essential staff. The Office of Clinical Research is fully operational and has contingency plans in place to maintain continuity. The Oncore Clinical Research Management System can be accessed anywhere an individual has internet access. Contact our staff at ResearchGo@mednet.ucla.edu or visit the UCLA CTSI Research Go COVID-19 INFO page for more detailed information. My office stands ready to support you in planning to ensure that your research activities continue with as little impact as possible. If you have questions, or if there is additional guidance you would like to see provided, please contact C19@research.ucla.edu. Sincerely, Roger M. Wakimoto, Ph.D. Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities"
16-Mar-20,335,Los Angeles,"To UCLA Recreation Members In times like these we must all do our part to protect ourselves and our community. While this may necessitate that we discontinue or restrict some aspects of our daily lifestyles, we hope you are still taking care of YOU during these stressful and unprecedented times. If you haven’t already, please browse our website for our free virtual opportunities to stay active. As a reminder, your membership was automatically placed on hold on March 16th until we are able to reopen.

When we get the approval to reopen, we will contact you by email and post information on our website. We hope you are staying healthy and safe. Thank you, UCLA Recreation"
16-Mar-20,443,Los Angeles,"Dear Colleagues: We wanted to write to express our deep appreciation for the incredible efforts that you are making to support our students and maintain academic continuity under these trying circumstances. We recognize that everyone on campus  faculty, staff, and students  is navigating a public health crisis that is causing significant temporary changes in both daily life and campus practices. It is important in such circumstances that we take care of ourselves and each other as we navigate this temporary crisis. But we also wanted to reassure you of our deep and ongoing commitment to UCLA as an in-person, residential research university. Although we are moving to remote instruction to help secure the health of the university, this is a temporary response to an immediate crisis. UCLA has a long tradition of bringing faculty and students together to pursue knowledge in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and museums; to encourage the arts in performance spaces and studios; and to discover and disseminate new knowledge and techniques in clinics and hospitals. Moreover, we believe firmly that the residential setting allows for the informal creativity and sharing of ideas and arguments that help students, researchers, staff, and faculty thrive intellectually and personally. We want to make one final point. UCLA faculty and staff have, for many years, been involved in exploring the possibilities of online teaching and learning. As those who have participated know, successfully mounting online courses takes a tremendous amount of labor, thought, and time. Our current online classes also have undergone rigorous Academic Senate review. Although we do not doubt the tremendous creativity of our faculty and graduate students, we want to assure everyone that we know that the remote courses that you will be offering this spring are not truly “online courses.” No one can expect you to master all of the various technologies, suddenly transition to sophisticated document delivery, or skillfully lead 500 people in a Zoom discussion without appropriate preparation. We are asking that you do your best in thinking of ways to offer your students your course materials in alternative modes under trying circumstances for all. The campus has been working hard to provide you with support as you move your classes into remote modes. Please seek out the help you need, but please remember that this situation is uncharted territory for the staff who are trying to help you to provide the best education that you can in this moment. UCLA is a remarkable institution filled with remarkably creative and talented people. We will get through the disruption of COVID-19. When we do, we are committed to returning to the teaching and learning that has made UCLA such a distinguished educational environment. Sincerely, Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Michael Meranze Chair, UCLA Academic Senate"
17-Mar-20,850,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: As we all work to adapt to our new environment following the president’s Friday declaration of a national emergency and recent announcements by the governor and mayor instituting state- and city-wide restrictions, we wanted to provide you with the latest information about UCLA’s continued efforts to protect our campus and the broader community from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although you can continue to visit UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website as well as Bruins Safe Online for the latest information, here are some updates intended to provide the Bruin community with helpful guidance: Meetings and events: UCLA is suspending all nonessential events of any size through the end of spring quarter. We strongly encourage every member of the campus community to carefully consider whether it is necessary to convene in person or hold group meetings or any other type of gathering. Public health officials tell us that reducing population density is the best way to limit the spread of COVID-19. Working remotely: If you are able to conduct your work remotely, we ask you to speak with your supervisor about how best to do so. Remaining six feet away from others, whenever possible, can help prevent infections transmitted by an uncovered cough or sneeze or from touching contaminated surfaces. All employees should remain home if they are sick. Campus libraries: In an effort to help reduce density, all UCLA Library locations are closed to the public until further notice, effective immediately. Only three libraries Powell, Young Research Library and the Biomedical Library will be open temporarily to UCLA students, staff and faculty with BruinCards on March 17 and 18 from 7:00 a.m. to midnight; and on March 19 from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Students will be able to check out lending laptops and tablets at these three locations through Campus Library Instructional Computing Commons. After March 19, all libraries will be closed until further notice. Materials on loan to patrons will automatically be renewed through June 30, 2020. Please visit the UCLA Library website for additional information on library hours, remote services and other resources. Campus dining and restaurants: All campus dining halls and quick-service restaurants will become “to-go” operations. Students will still enter the dining halls, but food will be served in to-go containers and items that had previously been offered at self-service stations (such as desert, pizza, soda and fruit) will instead be available in to-go containers; salad bars are being replaced by pre-mixed salads or will have an attendant taking orders. Managers and/or signs will control access and encourage students to line up at least six feet apart from each other. Some ASUCLA eateries have reduced hours, and all locations that remain open will be to-go only. Some, including Wolfgang Puck Express, are closed, but for now, most other ASUCLA eateries will continue serving to-go options. Knowing that things could change quickly, please check ASUCLA’s hours to confirm when and whether an eatery is open. In dining spaces, ASUCLA is removing large numbers of tables to increase the space between diners to at least six feet, and posting signs today to encourage guests to keep six feet or more between them while in line. Plateia at the Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center is also to-go only, and the lounge is closed. ASUCLA convenience markets remain open. Student support line: We will establish a support line for students if they need guidance on any issue related to COVID-19 or how campus operations are affected. Students can reach the support line at 310-825-3894 beginning Wednesday at 9 a.m., and it will remain in operation weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Grading and exams: Because students are taking final exams under these difficult circumstances, the UCLA Academic Senate strongly encourages all instructors to consider the current circumstances in both planning and evaluating final assessments and avail themselves of one of the options outlined in this message to faculty (PDF). We know that all of you are working to adapt to this rapidly evolving situation not just academically and professionally, but also personally. These challenges are only compounded by the personal challenges we all face, whether caring for family or finding basic household items in stores. We have been struck by the compassion and empathy we have seen Bruins exhibit for one another. Whether it is offering to check in with peers or going grocery shopping for neighbors, your actions have demonstrated that our capacity to live our True Bruin values is limitless. At some point soon, life will return to normal and we look forward to resuming activity as usual on campus. Until then, this new way of working, learning and living can protect us all, particularly those who are most vulnerable in our community. Thank you once again for your commitment to our campus and each other. Your resilience, understanding, and flexibility these past few weeks represent the very best of the Bruin spirit.

17-Mar-20,684,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: We have learned that a member of our UCLA campus community has tested positive for COVID-19. The individual is a UCLA staff member who works off campus, has self-isolated at their off-campus residence and is receiving care. I have spoken to our fellow Bruin to express my hope for a quick recovery. We are determining whether there are members of the UCLA community who need to be advised about their contacts with our staff member, and if so, we will activate our notification process accordingly. Please know that if there is a need for anyone to be isolated or tested, they will be contacted. We understand this news may heighten anxiety and create concern among members of our community. Students should contact the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217, and faculty and staff should call their health care providers, if they develop flu-like symptoms. Please always call ahead before arriving. Additionally, mental health is as important as physical health. Students can always seek services at UCLA’s Counseling and Psychological Services and staff and faculty can contact the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. It bears repeating that as testing for COVID-19 becomes more broadly available, we should prepare ourselves to expect the numbers of self-quarantine cases like mine and confirmed cases like that of our staff member to increase across the country and at UCLA. We have been expecting this reality, and we have prepared and implemented safety protocols accordingly. We remain committed to transparency and open communication on this important issue. When there are future confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our campus community, we will keep you informed through UCLA’s COVID-19 website, Bruins Safe Online and UCLA’s Twitter feed. Above all, please know that every decision we make is guided by our top priority of protecting the health and safety of our Bruin and global communities, in what continues to be a rapidly evolving environment. Our decisions on matters such as remote learning are driven by what science tells us: The reduction of population density helps slow the spread of the virus. You are all part of a community that cares about you. I am grateful to each of you for supporting UCLA’s broader efforts to help the world fight the spread of COVID-19. I could not be prouder to be a Bruin. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
17-Mar-20,929,Los Angeles,"Ramping Down UCLA Laboratory Research To the Campus Community: This message is sent with gratitude for your patience while we navigate the ever-changing environment of the developing COVID-19 crisis. As we continue to take measures to protect the health and well-being of everyone in our campus community, we have made the decision to ramp down nonessential campus operations, including research activities. Effective immediately, each principal investigator or group leader of a laboratory research program (experimental, computational or otherwise) must prepare and implement a strategy to ramp down campus laboratory research activities, with the expectation that suspended lab access will likely last at least six to eight weeks. PIs and laboratory leaders should also share your strategies with your department leadership. In your strategy, anticipate how the work of your group will be slowed or stopped for the coming weeks and identify essential research personnel and essential experiments. To be clear, essential research personnel are those individuals who are: Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals. This includes vivarium staff and non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care. The faculty and/or research staff who are necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research that includes not easily replaceable perishable research materials. Not easily replaceable perishable research materials could include primary cell lines or long-term experiments for which there would be considerable cost and/or time associated with requiring the experiment to end. (An example would be a continual, ongoing one-month experiment that requires regular measurements or maintenance, without which all previous data would be lost.) Responsible for maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage to equipment or extraordinary cost for example, cryogen fill on NMR spectrometers. Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion for example, research that relies on the ability to make specific measurements only a few times a year. Note that students (including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel. The decision to report to campus lies with the student worker, not their research advisor. Essential experiments are those for which suspension of activities would cause irreparable harm to the research project. Any requests for continuation of such a project must be approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. You may wish to use the UCLA Laboratory Ramp-Down Checklist (PDF) to plan the ramp-down process, noting that not all of the items on the list may apply to your specific lab. While this process may be disheartening, know that the steps you take now will support the long-term success of our labs and research groups. In addition, be advised that effective March 16, UCLA has issued a temporary policy related to human subjects–related research visits. Specifically, in-person research visits should not be conducted unless the specific research visit provides an immediate benefit to a participant’s health and/or well-being. Visit UCLA CTSI Research Go and the Office of the Human Research Protection Program website for detailed information about UCLA’s COVID-19 clinical research policy and human subjects research. In the meantime, I ask that you actively encourage staff, students and postdocs in your group to work from home whenever feasible. Encourage your colleagues to maintain a safe space of six feet from each other and practice good hygiene, and model these practices yourself. Absolutely require that if anyone in the group is sick, including essential personnel, they do not come to work. Establish a system by which you, and members of the lab, can check each other’s status. As a reminder, the University of California Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than laptops and data storage devices off site, including to their homes. We are facing an unprecedented challenge with COVID-19 and must all do our part to flatten the growth curve to protect our community and lessen predictable pressures on our public health infrastructure. Visit UCLA’s dedicated COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online for additional information and contact C19@research.ucla.edu with your research-specific questions. Sincerely, Roger Wakimoto Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities"
17-Mar-20,471,Los Angeles,"Mental Health and Social Well-Being amid Coronavirus Spread To the Campus Community: The concerns about the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are being addressed in multiple ways here at UCLA. At the same time, information about the virus and its effects, including misleading information from outside sources, can heighten our fear and anxiety. The uncertainty surrounding this global and local event is unsettling for many of us, and there is much uncertainty about the coming weeks and months. You are receiving information from good, trusted sources here at UCLA through our dedicated COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online. We also recommend the World Health Organization (PDF) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites, resources that offer trusted information about mental health considerations. Even during these trying times, there are many aspects of daily life that remain under your control, including how you take care of your emotional, social and physical well-being, and your ability to support and help your friends, family and community. Here are a few highlights: Take care of your body. Eating healthy meals, exercising, getting at least seven hours of sleep a night, and limiting your alcohol consumption can help your immune system. Even while maintaining a safe distance from other people, you can still go outside! Regular exercise can reduce anxiety. Just be sure to protect yourself and others by following these guidelines for managing anxiety and stress. Learn and share. Learn best practices from trusted resources on how to limit your exposure to, and the spread of, COVID-19, and share that information with others. UCLA is providing information relevant to our specific roles as students, faculty and staff. The WHO website details actions for health care workers, team leaders, caretakers of children, older adults and people in isolation. The CDC website lists common warning signs of emotional stress responses (including problems with sleep and concentration, and increased drug or alcohol use) and some ideas for how to cope. Do things that give you purpose and meaning. Helping others is a gift, and it is good for your own well-being. Many in our community are more vulnerable to the impact of the novel coronavirus. You can help others by offering reassurance and emotional support, for instance. Take care of basic needs (including food security). The CPO Food Closet is open today through Thursday, March 19, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and on Friday, March 20, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The food closet will open again on Monday, March 23, and on Tuesday, March 24, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., but will close for the remainder of Spring Break. These hours are subject to change, so please check the CPO Facebook page for up-to-date hours of operation. Lastly, the Economic Crisis Response Team will have its meal voucher program distribution four times during finals week. Please see the team’s most up-to-date meal voucher distribution schedule (PDF) for times and locations. Take care of your mind. Constant searching, scrolling or consumption of coronavirus news will only make us feel more afraid and powerless. Take breaks from media coverage and use UCLA’s COVID-19 website and Bruins Safe Online for updates rather than checking unreliable sites. For many of us, maintaining routines will help keep us positive, balanced and mentally well. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. Reach out to others and offer support, empathy, information and, if possible, tangible help. Stay connected using technology such as video chat, Zoom group calls, and cellphone texting and conversations. Personal relationships are crucial in maintaining perspective and elevating mood. Increase your feel-good activities. Whether it’s mindfulness, talking to your friends and family members, going for walks, taking part in sports, journaling, or watching Netflix, now is the time to increase positive experiences in your daily schedule. For a quick stress reliever, UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center offers free guided meditations in English and Spanish. Treat everyone with dignity and respect. Let’s work together to address xenophobic sentiments that perpetuate stigma toward people from the countries most affected by COVID-19. Members of our community are experiencing additional fear right now because of the increased suspicion and racism from others who wrongly attach COVID-19 to an ethnicity or nationality. Language like COVID-19 “victims” or “the diseased” is stigmatizing and harmful. Instead, we can say “people who are being treated for or recovering from COVID-19.” Pay attention to how you’re feeling. Fear, worry and dread are normal reactions during this unprecedented time. People who have pre-existing mental health concerns are more vulnerable and face a higher risk of worsening mental health as the virus spreads. If you have a history of mental health concerns, form a plan such as how to access health workers, counselors and prescriptions. Resources for students are available at Counseling & Psychological Services and for staff at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. This message reflects the expertise of the leaders of the Semel Healthy Campus Initiative MindWell and EngageWell pods. The Semel Healthy Campus Initiative website provides a wealth of additional information on health and well-being. You are part of a UCLA community that is home to health experts who are committed to containing, delaying and reducing the impact of this virus in our community. We encourage you to stay abreast of all new information from trusted sources and share accurate information with others. Each of us can play a very important role by caring for ourselves and caring for others in our community. Sincerely, Wendelin Slusser Associate Vice Provost, Semel Healthy Campus Initiative Center at UCLA Clinical Professor, David Geffen School of Medicine"
18-Mar-20,131,Los Angeles,"Deans and Department Chair: Extension of Graduate Thesis and Dissertation Submission Deadlines for Winter Quarter Dear Colleagues: To ensure that graduate students are impacted as little as possible by the rapidly changing events associated with COVID-19, the Graduate Council has voted to extend dissertation, thesis and capstone project filing deadlines from March 20, 2020 to April 10, 2020 for the winter 2020 quarter. The Graduate Division is working closely with the Registrar to implement this change. The Graduate Council will re-evaluate this policy in early spring in accordance with campus recommendations regarding COVID-19. Please forward this information to the staff and/or faculty in your department. With best wishes, Robin L. Garrell Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division Andrea M.

18-Mar-20,356,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: Being a Bruin means more than just being on UCLA’s campus; it also encompasses the emotional and social ties we share with one another. For many UCLA students, no experience is more valued than celebrating the culmination of their hard work and dedication along with their families and friends during graduation ceremonies. As we all work to limit the spread of COVID-19, it has become increasingly clear that we will not be able to gather in person for spring 2020 commencement ceremonies, so the College commencement, doctoral hooding ceremony and all campus graduation ceremonies will be adapted to be virtual events. Our decisions to transition to remote learning and suspend all nonessential events of any size through the end of the spring quarter have been driven entirely by our desire to protect the health and safety of our community, which includes all of the family and friends who would have joined us at our commencement ceremonies. For the UCLA College, whose commencement is UCLA’s largest, we will hold an engaging virtual ceremony on June 12, 2020. Consistent with our tradition, the ceremony will feature an inspiring keynote speaker, whose name will be announced soon. The College will offer new opportunities to connect our graduates in a variety of ways that further enhance the virtual event. As we move into a spring quarter of remote learning, please know that we are actively exploring how we might enhance the student experience while everyone is away from campus, particularly for our seniors. For the soon-to-be graduates of UCLA, in the weeks ahead, we will provide additional information about how we will mark their important accomplishments. Campus leadership will be in touch with the schools and departments that hold individual commencements to provide support where possible. We will share more details about those efforts as soon as we are able. Please remember that, even for an event as momentous as commencement, the day does not define the journey. We will work diligently to make graduation as special as possible for all of our students and all of your loved ones. Even when we are apart, we remain deeply connected as Bruins, and I look forward to celebrating your accomplishments this spring. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
19-Mar-20,403,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: Yesterday, we made a decision about this year’s commencement ceremonies without first consulting our students and fully understanding their preferences for this important rite of passage. In these unprecedented times, we are guided by our goal of protecting the safety of our Bruin community. But we should have known the impact this decision would make, especially during this tense time, and we should have listened first. For this, I apologize. We have heard the important voices of our students and their families, and based on those, we will step back and make a decision on commencement in consultation with students and student leaders. I understand that for so many of our students and their families and friends, our commencement ceremonies celebrate not only past achievements, but also the promise of what is to come. I deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication that goes into earning a UCLA degree. It is a great accomplishment fully deserving of a ceremony that acknowledges students’ years of commitment to reaching that milestone. Our ceremonies are as diverse as our student body. Whether it is our campus, departmental or student-initiated commencement, our ceremonies are without question the most wonderful and moving events that we have on our campus, not only because they honor our students, but also because they give family and friends who supported them a proud moment they, too, will carry for the rest of their lives. The decisions we have had to make in the past few weeks, all designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our community, are ones that few of us ever anticipated in our lifetimes. We are all working hard to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances and find ways to prioritize the health of our community. In this environment, despite our best efforts, sometimes we move too quickly. I regret that we did that here and did not properly include students in the decision-making process. We will be connecting with our student leadership, including the Undergraduate Students Association Council and Graduate Students Association, so that we can make these decisions together. We are committed to giving all of our students the commencement they deserve. We should have known the tremendous impact that this decision would have on our students and their loved ones and friends. We will do better to include these important voices going forward. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor"
20-Mar-20,1357,Los Angeles,"Today, Los Angeles County (PDF) and the City of Los Angeles (PDF), among other nearby jurisdictions, ordered all residents to stay home starting 11:59 p.m. tonight, March 19, through April 19, 2020, which are actions similar to those of other large metropolitan areas attempting to limit the spread of COVID-19. Educational institutions, like UCLA, are subject to these orders but are considered essential businesses. This means we will suspend all on-campus operations with the exception of those that are essential and cannot be conducted remotely, effective 11:59 p.m. on March 20, 2020. We understand that each new announcement from campus leadership about the coronavirus creates new challenges for all of us. Your flexibility and commitment the past few weeks have been inspiring and our community is now called upon to comply with these orders. During this time, campus will operate similar to winter closure, meaning that only a few core services will be operating. Here is a summary of those operations we have determined to be essential for purposes of complying, including those that will continue on campus at this time: Health care services and corresponding support. UCLA hospitals and clinics will remain open and fully operational; more information is available on UCLA Health’s website Classroom and laboratory instruction for remote learning will continue through the end of spring quarter. Deans and chairs will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed Student housing and dining services Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels Animal care or animal research Research laboratory safety Research approved by the vice chancellor for research Emergency response, such as police, fire, emergency medical services, and environment health and safety Emergency management Custodial services will continue to operate at reduced levels, but surfaces in common areas continue to be sanitized regularly Building systems IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning Human resources, finance and counseling services will continue, but primarily remotely The Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center will remain open for in-person services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), although all services will be offered via telehealth. Students should call CAPS at 310-825-0768, 24/7, for assistance. No onsite services will be available at this time This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential administrative services will be distributed separately. In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, below is a summary of decisions from our administration. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. Employees in the Health System are generally exempt from the restrictions below when providing health care services. The current UCLA directives instruct that you should: Cease all in-person instruction. Remote teaching and learning will continue through the end of spring quarter without exceptions. Instructors and students should become familiar with academic continuity tools and faculty may join UCLA’s workshops for remote teaching and learning. Only stay in student housing if you need it. The county and city orders do not prevent students from moving out of campus housing to return to their permanent residence. However, students who need to stay in housing may be moved to a different building to support the needs of the community. As shared earlier, students who choose to move out of UCLA housing can obtain prorated relief from their housing contracts. Students should emailUCLAhousing@housing.ucla.edu with any questions. Essential activities including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence is permitted. Only come to work if your supervisor has told you to do so to fulfill an essential function. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting an essential operation on campus. If you do not think that you are supporting an essential operation, but are expected to report to work anyway, you can contact your department’s human resources representative to confirm whether your work is essential. Courtesy parking is available for employees and students who must come to campus during this period in order to reduce reliance on public transportation and avoid crowds. Log in to the Bruin ePermit portal to register your vehicle to park in select parking structures at no additional cost. Employees and students with parking permits will not be charged for parking during this period, even those using payroll deduction. Regularly visit UCLA’s COVID-19 webpage for resources about how to address mental and social wellbeing during this time. Students may also call or contact CAPS at 310-825-0768 24/7 for assistance. Staff and faculty may contact the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. Contact UCLA’s student support line for general student support at 310-825-3894 from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays. Send email to covid19@ucla.edu with any questions regarding UCLA’s response to COVID-19. You should not do the following: Do not host any in-person UCLA events or gatherings of any size through the end of spring quarter. Do not come to work if you are sick. Students living on or off campus may contact the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217 with questions about how to self-quarantine, for health monitoring or if they need other support. Faculty and staff who are sick should contact their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. If you are ordered to self-isolate or to self-quarantine related to a COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis, notify UCLA Occupational Health Services at 310-267-3300. Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave. Do not come to work if you have been asked to work remotely. Some personnel assigned to essential roles that need to be conducted on campus will need to continue to work on campus, and leadership is working with supervisors to define and identify these roles and personnel. Note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel. We expect that supervisors will work with their staff to update business continuity plans. If employees, including student employees, are not required to work on campus, but cannot work from home due to the nature of their jobs, the UC Office of the President has developed expanded leave policies and employees should consult with their supervisors about use of these policies. IT support services will be fully operational and faculty and staff who need assistance while working remotely should contact their local help desk per standard procedure. If you are not able to reach your departmental help desk, you may call the IT Services Support Center at (310) 267-HELP (4357). Do not come to work to engage in research, except to engage in ramp down, continuity or laboratory safety work. Essential experiments and essential research personnel may continue, but only with the approval of designated leadership within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR), the David Geffen School of Medicine, the Samueli School of Engineering and the UCLA College. The OVCR is issuing more specific guidelines for on-campus research, off-campus research and clinical research activities, which will be distributed separately. Do not come to work to take advantage of better internet connections or fewer distractions, except for classroom or laboratory instruction for remote teaching. We understand that it may be harder for some employees to conduct work from home. UCLA has procured IT equipment and portable internet hotspots to help faculty and staff work from home. Faculty and staff can address their needs with supervisors or department chairs. Do not come to work to retrieve items from your office or visit colleagues required to be on campus after Friday, March 20 at 11:59 p.m. Only come to campus if you have permission from your supervisor. We want to assure each member of our Bruin community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on UCLA’s COVID-19 information page, Bruins Safe Online and UCLA’s Twitter feed. Most importantly, please continue to be good to each other and yourselves. We will get through this together. We are all Bruins, now and always. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor Emily A.

20-Mar-20,348,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: We are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic may be creating unforeseen financial challenges for our students and their families, and we are working diligently with our campus partners to address its effects on the Bruin community. In an effort to help members of our community manage their finances during this turbulent time, UCLA has decided to make the following changes for spring quarter 2020: BruinPay Plan enrollment. Students can continue to enroll in BruinPay Plan through Friday, April 10 at 5 p.m. PDT. Eligible students can enroll in BruinPay Plan to pay their term tuition and registration fees in monthly installments (three installments for quarter students). If you are eligible to enroll, you will see an active enrollment link on the BruinBill homepage under the My BruinPay Plan section. You will need a U.S. checking or savings account or a credit card to complete enrollment. Spring term tuition. The deadline for online payment through BruinBill for spring quarter 2020 has been extended to April 10 at 5 p.m. PDT. Please note that no changes have been announced for the spring quarter 2020 UC systemwide and campus-based fee. If changes occur, they will be reflected on your BruinBill. More information can be found on the Registrar’s Office COVID-19 FAQ. Spring quarter 2020 Course Materials Fees.

20-Mar-20,955,Los Angeles,"Most Campus Laboratory Research to Shut Down To the Campus Community: I appreciate your efforts to develop strategies for ramping down on-campus research activities following my March 17 communication. In light of Los Angeles County’s safer at home order, UCLA has determined that these ramp-down strategies must be fully deployed by Monday. Please know that buildings will be locked at 10 p.m. tonight and remain locked on Monday, so please check with your department if you require special arrangements to enter your building. Effective at 11:59 p.m. tonight, all on-campus operations will be suspended, with the exception of those that are essential and cannot be conducted remotely. Effective immediately, all group meetings, courses and scientific convocations are to transition to virtual environments for example, Zoom, Slack or another approved, secure platform. Research performed on campus If you have not already done so, please obtain approval for any essential experiments and essential research personnel you believe must remain active on campus during this time. To minimize community interactions, each lab is to activate no more than one or two essential research personnel to manage animal husbandry, equipment or essential experiments. To ensure the safety of essential research personnel, labs should establish a communication protocol and use it while personnel are working on campus. Some units, including the David Geffen School of Medicine, Samueli School of Engineering and the UCLA College Divisions of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences, have developed internal processes and deadlines for researchers to obtain approval for personnel and experiments. Those units will communicate directly with researchers under their purview. All other requests are to be submitted to me via C19@research.ucla.edu. Requests to continue research activities must include a full description of why the on-campus research is essential, a timeline for completion and documented support of the department chair or dean; essential personnel should also be identified in each request. All on-campus projects and personnel not approved to continue research activities or that do not have a pending request to their unit filed are required to cease operations. As previously communicated, essential research personnel are those individuals who are: Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research, including the well-being of research animals. This includes vivarium lab staff and non-vivarium lab staff responsible for animal care, although staffing should be minimized to the extent feasible to maintain the health and safety of the animals. Necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of research that includes not easily replaceable, perishable research materials. Responsible for the maintenance of equipment that, if not done, could result in damage to equipment or extraordinary cost for example, cryogen fill on NMR spectrometers. Researchers working on experiments that have a small window for completion for example, research that relies on the ability to make specific measurements only a few times a year. As a reminder, note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve as essential personnel. Essential experiments are those for which suspension of on-campus activities would cause irreparable harm to the research project. This will usually involve ongoing animal experiments that required enormous time and cost to get to their current state, and that will be completed in the near future. UCLA has also made a commitment to prioritizing COVID-19 research. Requests for continuation of such projects must be described in writing as indicated above. In animal facilities, all animal orders, imports/exports and internal transfers will be put on hold and rodent breeding reduced to the minimum possible. Please contact UCLA’s Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine for guidance on identifying unique and irreplaceable animals. Study areas maintaining aquatic, avian or other species are expected to maintain basic animal care and husbandry operations, and labs with USDA-covered animals that require specialized lab care or intensive husbandry operations are expected to continue providing this care as well. Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) staff are available for safety consultations related to ramping down your on-campus research activities. Contact C19Support@ehs.ucla.edu for support. In the event of a lab emergency, researchers should immediately call 911 rather than the EH&S hotline or email contacts. Clinical research activities With respect to clinical research, in-person research visits should not be conducted unless the specific research visit provides an immediate benefit to a participant’s health and/or well-being, or the visit is part of the course of ongoing clinical care. (Note: Policies for routine and elective visits are also undergoing review by UCLA Health.) Please consider suspending recruitment or conducting follow-up visits remotely, if this presents no harm to your participants. Please also be certain to personally inform participants of the risks of COVID-19. Visit UCLA CTSI Research Go and the Office of the Human Research Protection Program website for detailed information about UCLA’s COVID-19 clinical research policy and human subjects research. Off-campus research activities Research activities that can be performed remotely and do not require physical interaction with human subjects (for example, field studies, surveys, record reviews and data analysis) can and should continue. As a reminder, the University of California Office of the President has stated that under no circumstances are researchers to take materials other than lab notebooks, laptops and data storage devices off-site, including to their homes. Notebooks taken off campus must be inventoried and tracked to protect university property while off-site. While it is not possible to predict how long we will remain in this new state of ramped-down activities, you should plan for the possibility that this could continue through the end of the quarter or longer. I will continue to communicate with you regularly as I receive new information. Thank you for being True Bruins and exemplary members of our community.

26-Mar-20,1213,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: The Academic Senate wishes to express its appreciation to all the faculty, staff, and students who have put in such extraordinary efforts to complete the winter quarter under the stress of moving final assessments to alternative modes in response to COVID-19. We also recognize that the necessity to move to remote instruction for spring quarter will continue to pose new challenges and stresses for the campus community. We wish to acknowledge that our current situation presents considerable hardships for our students and that those hardships may fall unequally on different students. Under the university’s system of shared governance, the UCLA Academic Senate has purview over certain aspects of UCLA, distinct from the administration overseen by the chancellor. In particular, the Senate makes decisions on such matters as degree and enrollment requirements, grading policy and program establishment, disestablishment, and review. In order to support faculty, staff, and students in their efforts to sustain instructional continuity and do their best work productively under these circumstances, the Undergraduate and Graduate Councils of the Senate have exercised their purview and taken steps to increase flexibility and reduce stress for all those involved with the instructional effort. These steps are listed below. The Undergraduate Council has voted: To suspend UCLA Senate Regulation A-310 (A) and (E) for spring quarter 2020, and to empower undergraduate students in good standing to take more than one course in a term on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. To extend the deadline for changing the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction for spring quarter 2020. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020. The Graduate Council has voted: To temporarily delegate authority to departments, Interdepartmental Degree Programs (IDPs), or schools to allow graduate students in good academic standing to enroll in more than one course graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis for spring quarter 2020, including courses within the degree program, with the stipulation that departments, IDPs, or schools must accept these courses towards fulfilling degree requirements if taken for an S/U grade. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020. It is also worth noting that graduate students are already permitted to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction. These suspensions and delegations should provide both graduate and undergraduate students with the capacity to choose a course of study that will enable them to continue their progress to degree and also to adjust their academic burdens in accord with their own personal needs at this time. We recognize that these actions will not solve all of the challenges associated with remote education. But after careful consideration and review of all options, we are confident that they will best support the efforts of faculty, staff, and students as we work together to address the challenges of spring quarter. Reminder for Instructors The Academic Senate would also like to remind all instructors that the partial suspensions of Senate Regulations 332 and 505 (PDF) continue in force. These suspensions empower you to have greater flexibility both in the forms of assessment you plan to use and also in the distribution of points among different assessments. As with this past quarter, we urge instructors to use this flexibility to take into account the special challenges that will accompany remote instruction. Given the uncertainties surrounding technical issues and the possibilities of disrupted connections, as well as the closure of libraries and study spaces, we urge everyone to approach spring quarter with mutual compassion and openness to the challenges faced by all. Reminders for Undergraduate and Graduate Students We also want to point out several issues that students should consider as they chart their course for spring quarter: The capacity to declare P/NP or S/U in multiple courses is not presently available through MyUCLA. The Registrar is working diligently on this issue and expects it to be available by mid-quarter. As a result, you do not have to make any changes in your grading choices at this time. You will be able to do that later in the quarter. We do recommend, however, that you check to make certain that any courses you might wish to take P/NP or S/U offer that option to students. Please be aware that this change in grading policy does not override any requirements that colleges, departments, or programs may have that courses be taken for a letter grade in order to receive major or program credit. Please check with your advisers and counselors before you consider courses in your home program or major. Certain forms of financial aid require that you enroll for a minimum number of credits with letter grades. Please consult with Financial Aid about your particular situation. We have moved the deadline for changing your grade option in undergraduate courses from letter to P/NP until Friday of the 10th week of classes. This will allow you to evaluate your standing in a class before making a final grade option selection. Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that undergraduate students receive a C or better in order to earn a Pass in a P/NP. Similarly at UCLA, undergraduate students who take a course P/NP must achieve a C in order to receive a Pass. Undergraduate students who take a course for a letter grade will receive credit if they receive a C- or a D. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for an undergraduate student taking a course P/NP. Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that graduate students receive a B or better in order to earn a Satisfactory in a S/U. At UCLA, graduate students may receive course credit for C- and above grades unless otherwise prohibited by program requirements. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for a graduate student taking a course S/U than is required to receive credit when taking under a letter grade. The minimum GPA for a graduate degree is 3.0, so graduate students should carefully consider whether to use the S/U option depending on their individual situation, as S/U courses are not used in GPA calculations. We recognize the large challenges facing the campus and its faculty, students, and staff during spring quarter. We remain confident in the resilience of the UCLA community to work together in a spirit of patience and empathy as we pursue our educational goals during an uncertain time. Sincerely, Michael Meranze Professor of History Chair, UCLA Academic Senate"
27-Mar-20,386,Los Angeles,"Our Gratitude to UCLA Staff o Our Staff: As we all work to adapt to the new realities of these trying times, we want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for the deep and abiding commitment of UCLA’s staff. We know that the outsized impact of UCLA is only possible because of your dedication, hard work, and partnership. Particularly during these times of great stress and uncertainty, we want to thank you for your exceptional efforts to support our Bruin community. We have asked leadership all across UCLA to be flexible and considerate of our staff as you work to adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We know that many staff members will need flexibility, particularly those caring for dependents at home or facing other significant challenges related to the current crisis. We understand that we must be flexible and alter our expectations of what can be accomplished in this uncertain era. We recognize the enormous challenges being asked of all staff to ensure the continuity of campus operations and the more complicated support of our faculty and students in the weeks and months ahead. We are grateful for the commitment of both the staff serving on campus and those now supporting our mission remotely. We want you to know how much we appreciate your hard work and devotion to UCLA. Please remember that your community has resources that we hope make this time easier. Colleagues at the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center are available to provide support during this challenging time. We have created a comprehensive set of FAQs to try to answer questions you might have, and any additional questions can be emailed to covid19@ucla.edu. For our part, we are working hard to remain as responsive as possible and addressing issues that arise. We are grateful for all of your flexibility, ingenuity, understanding, and perseverance, as you work in this new reality and solve problems within your unit.

2-Apr-20,254,Los Angeles,"To the UC community We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time. The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together. Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time. To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus. To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time. To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID- 19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible. While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary. Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together. Fiat lux, Janet Napolitano                   Gene D.

8-Apr-20,549,Los Angeles,"UCLA Guidance on Face Coverings to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 To the Campus Community: On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of cloth face coverings in public settings (especially in areas of significant community-based transmission) to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The California Department of Public Health, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (PDF) and the Office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti have also issued guidance acknowledging that wearing cloth face covers can reduce the likelihood of transmission from asymptomatic individuals who are unaware that they are infected. It is important to note that these nonmedical-grade face coverings are intended to protect others from the wearer’s respiratory droplets, and are to supplement but not substitute for measures such as physical distancing and frequent hand-washing, which continue to be the most effective methods for reducing the spread of COVID-19. While there are ongoing discussions among public health officials and other experts regarding which materials are most effective, current data suggests that acceptable options including bandanas, neck gaiters, homemade face coverings, scarves, and tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton T-shirts and towels. (See this briefing from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (PDF) for more information.) Although face coverings are not a requirement for universities under the worker protection order (PDF) issued by Mayor Garcetti on April 7, they will be important in helping us protect each other from transmitting the virus. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the Bruin community use face coverings when in public settings, conducting essential work on campus, or entering campus dining facilities or other environments in which it may be difficult to maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people. Helpful instructions for making your own face covering can be found on this CDC fact sheet (PDF) as well as in this instructional video from the U.S. Surgeon General. Detailed instructions on how to make a face mask - click for high resolution image. Click image for higher resolution. UCLA is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note these will be nonmedical-grade face coverings and will not be appropriate for health care workers, first responders or others working directly with people who have COVID-19. Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including vanpools, hospitality, dining services and laboratories. Masks will be distributed to campus departments when production is complete, which could take a week or more because of the heightened worldwide demand for them. Campus officials will coordinate with departments to disseminate the masks when we receive them. Face coverings will be required for employees working at the Luskin Conference Center, the Tiverton House, the Lake Arrowhead Conference Center, and UCLA housing and dining facilities as of this Friday, April 10. UCLA will provide face coverings for those employees. The safety and well-being of our students, staff and faculty is of the utmost importance, and we will continue to dedicate unified efforts to protect our campus community.

13-Apr-20,794,Los Angeles,"Mental Health and Social Well-being during the Pandemic To the Campus Community: Each of you is a valued member of the Bruin family, and we want to ensure you have information to help you maintain your health and well-being during this difficult time. We also want to acknowledge the challenges you face while continuing your work and studies virtually, often in situations and locations that are not as conducive to the level of excellence to which you are accustomed. We hope the following guidance and tips will help you adjust to the new environments in which you are working and studying. Where to get trusted information regarding COVID-19 Browse smartly. Manage your information channels. Try to avoid news and information overload and fatigue by balancing news sources. If you find yourself checking the news multiple times a day, take a break and do something else. Get credible information from trusted websites. Information from good, trusted sources here at UCLA and the University of California is available through our dedicated COVID-19 website, Bruins Safe Online, UCLA Health, the University of California and the Semel Healthy Campus Initiative (HCI) Center. We also recommend the World Health Organization (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites for further information. Tips for transitioning to online teaching, learning and working Establish a routine. Try to establish some normalcy and a regular sleep-wake cycle while working from home. Eat, sleep, work and exercise at regular times each day if possible. Get outside every day and catch some fresh air and sunshine, while maintaining a safe distance from others. Create a routine that works for you doing so can boost spirits and create a sense of normalcy. Check in with each other. Faculty can designate class time to check in with students and have students check in with each other. Please review these tips from UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for other ways faculty can support students. Keep physical distance, reduce “social distance.” Ask someone you work with, teach or learn from at UCLA how they are coping with the safer at home orders. Share how you are coping and listen to their experiences with empathy put yourself in their shoes. Monitor screen time. Balance your time online with other activities such as cooking, art, craft projects, making or playing music, reading books, calling friends or family, writing poetry, cleaning and organizing, and getting outside to walk, run or bike. If you feel overwhelmed with online meetings, it is OK to turn off the screen and do something else. Broaden your view by looking at the horizon at sunset, or gaze at stars. Check out tips for keeping busy and connected and ideas for at-home activities. Reach out on your own behalf. You are your own best advocate. Make sure your basic needs are met. If you are experiencing any disruption in basic needs for food, housing, phone service, or physical or mental health service, find the resources on campus to help. This is a time of enormous and sudden change, so feelings of anxiety, sadness, disappointment, lack of concentration or motivation are normal and expected. Here are some campus resources that you can access any time: For students: CAPS: CAPS crisis line: (310) 825-0768 Economic Crisis Response Team STAND Program (part of UCLA Depression Grand Challenge): Remote screening, tracking and treatment for anxiety and depression, suitable for students both within and outside of California. For staff and faculty: Staff and Faculty Counseling Center Resources for emotional, social and physical health Mindfulness practices. Relieve stress with meditation. UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Center offers free guided meditations in English and Spanish. 6 Feet Apart podcast. UCLA’s LiveWell podcast launched a new special series in which the team from the Semel HCI Center interviews experts about how we can maintain all dimensions of our health during the pandemic. Episode topics include maintaining your social well-being and supporting your emotional well-being. Virtual fitness classes. Check out the UCLA Recreation website for virtual classes and ways to stay fit. Cooking and meal planning. Minimize trips to the grocery store by cooking from your pantry and freezer. Pasta, rice and beans are great staples. Also, frozen vegetables are quick and easy ways to get your veggies. Frozen greens are also great in smoothies or blended soups use nuts to make them creamy. And you can add frozen fruit to smoothies, or heat it to make a fruit compote topping for yogurt. Tips for working at home Minimize distractions to improve focus. Set and respect boundaries with others in your home. Designate a dedicated work area, use headphones, take calls in another room, where possible, and devote time each day to tasks requiring focused concentration. Take frequent, regular breaks. Breaks allow your body and mind to rejuvenate. Set a reminder every hour for a two- to three-minute micro-break: Stand up, stretch and walk around. Movement is important for relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow to reduce fatigue and stress. Give your eyes a break, too, with the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Apply healthy ergonomic principles. A comfortable workstation improves efficiency and reduces physical and mental stress. UCLA telecommute tips are available to guide you through the setup process. UCLA is holding ergonomics Q&A sessions (PDF) (UCLA login required) via Zoom each Monday through Thursday from 10 to 11 a.m. for students, staff and faculty. Finally, we would like to recognize the Semel HCI pod leaders for their dedicated leadership and for sharing their expertise and insights to help the campus community maintain our social, emotional and physical well-being and build resilience for the weeks and months to come. Let’s all support each other during these challenging times. We are very proud to be Bruins, now more than ever, as we continue to observe the caring, commitment and resilience we are demonstrating by pulling together during this unprecedented time.

14-Apr-20,482,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: On April 10, Los Angeles County extended its ""safer at home"" order (PDF) to May 15 to continue our region’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, reduced campus operations will continue through that date, pending possible future extensions. Additionally, as previously announced, remote instruction will continue through at least the end of Summer Session A. As shared in a campuswide message on March 19, the campus is operating much like it does during annual winter closure, with only essential services in effect. Please visit the UCLA Administration website for the latest information about the availability of campus services during the safer at home orders. In addition to the extension, the county’s updated order requires that all essential businesses, including universities, develop protocols for maintaining physical distance (PDF) in facilities that are frequented by the public and employees. The order also requires that everyone wear cloth face coverings when visiting essential businesses, and it requires employees to wear cloth face coverings if they work in areas where they will be in contact with others for 10 minutes or more in areas where a distance of 6 feet or more cannot be maintained. Exceptions include individuals performing roles that require more prescriptive personal protective equipment, such as first responders and those in health care and research labs. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. UCLA is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff who are working on campus in close quarters (at a distance of 6 feet or less for 10 minutes or more) and for students living in on-campus housing. Employees who need cloth facing coverings should speak with their department managers; managers are asked to please fill out this Cloth Face Covering Request Form for their teams. For students living on the Hill, a communication will be sent from Housing on when and where these masks will be available, once they have been received. This UCLA COVID-19 Response flier (PDF) provides additional helpful information for staff and students on campus. We know that adapting to this new way of life over the past few weeks has been challenging, as so many of us are still adjusting to remote teaching, learning and working. Our nurses and doctors, residents and fellows, maintenance workers and support staff on campus are also facing daunting challenges. Please know that your resilience and commitment to UCLA’s mission is a source of motivation for your fellow Bruins. As always, UCLA is fully committed to the health and well-being of every member of the campus community. We will be in touch with additional updates, and we are posting new information regularly on UCLA’s COVID-19 information page and Bruins Safe Online. Please continue to take good care of yourselves and each other. Sincerely, Michael J. Beck Administrative Vice Chancellor"
28-Apr-20,668,Los Angeles,"To the Campus Community: As we navigate these unprecedented times, our decisions will continue to be guided by the safety and welfare of our Bruin community. UCLA remains committed to providing the best possible experience to our students. We know there are many important questions about the coming academic year and we are dedicated to proactively sharing the latest information about our plans as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Like universities across the nation and the world, UCLA is working to develop plans despite rapidly evolving data and shifting circumstances. We understand these plans will impact all of you and we are committed to a thoughtful approach that is inclusive of the broader campus community. To that end, we have established a Future Planning Task Force that will explore and submit recommendations to us regarding academic planning, student experience, how we continue research and work, our approach to on-campus housing, our policies for events and gatherings and how physical distancing, as one key consideration, will impact these plans. The task force, chaired by UCLA Fielding School of Public Health Dean Ron Brookmeyer, includes representation from our community of students, faculty and staff, and will take numerous internal and external factors into account. We will share information about key decisions based on those recommendations as soon as we are able. As the work of this task force progresses, we wanted to share the latest information available in some key areas. Decisions on remote versus in-person instruction While we are all eager to see UCLA return to normal operations, the health and safety of our entire campus community must continue to guide our decisions. We are weighing various factors and scenarios for the 2020–21 academic year, gathering data and working closely with public health officials before making any decisions. At a minimum, since we know it might not be possible for some students to safely travel to campus, we plan to offer the option of remote learning at least for fall quarter, even if some classes are held in person. As previously announced, remote instruction will continue through the end of this year’s Summer Session A, and we will announce plans for Summer Session C soon. Tuition and mandatory fees The UC Office of the President has previously announced that “tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction, and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the academic year.” Recognizing that we need to maintain campus operations, full tuition and mandatory fees will be necessary to cover many ongoing operations related to COVID-19 such as remote instruction and services such as registration, financial aid and remote academic advising. Housing In normal times, UCLA is able to offer housing to a majority of incoming and returning students. At this point, it is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations in student housing and residential life during the 2020–21 academic year and therefore we are unfortunately unable to provide a housing guarantee. We remain absolutely committed to offering housing to as many students as possible, while adhering to the latest recommendations from public health officials and our commitment to the safety of our students. Because circumstances around the pandemic are rapidly changing, it is not yet possible to know how many students we will be able to accommodate in residential halls and apartments. Please be assured that if we are unable to fulfill housing requests, we plan to offer remote learning as an alternative. We will continue to share information as soon as we are able. In closing, we thank you all once again for your continued resilience and consideration as we navigate these challenging and unprecedented times. As a world-class public institution, we remain dedicated to sustaining UCLA’s missions of teaching, research and service. All of you and our broader communities locally and globally deserve nothing less. Sincerely, Gene D. Block Chancellor Emily A. Carter Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost"
7-May-20,469,Los Angeles,"Financial Support for UCLA Students Dear Students: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the financial hardships and mental health toll that it has wrought on many of our students and their families have mounted, as has the urgent need to provide relief and support during these trying times. To that end, on behalf of the chancellor and executive vice chancellor and provost, I am pleased to share that UCLA will use a portion of the funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, to provide a $200 universal impact award to all eligible students. In addition to the universal impact award, some of the CARES Act funding will go toward supporting thousands of undergraduate and graduate students who are eligible for need-based federal financial aid. These students will receive increased grant support ranging from $200 to $1,850, depending on their financial need. In accordance with our firm commitment to the principles of inclusion and equity, and our commitment to all students during these unprecedented times, UCLA will use campus resources to provide some level of support to students who have been impacted by COVID-19, but who are not eligible for CARES funding, such as our undocumented and international students. All impacted students who are not eligible for CARES funding will receive a $200 universal impact award from the university’s private and institutional grants. These students also have the opportunity to apply for need-based financial support from appropriate university resources. The universal impact award came at the recommendation of a task force, which was inclusive of undergraduate and graduate student leader representatives, who reviewed a number of options in making their recommendations on the criteria for fund distribution. Additionally, at the suggestion of student leaders on the CARES task force, we have incorporated an opt-out option that allows students to donate their share of the universal impact award to their peers who may be in greater need. Funds from the opt-out option would be used to provide grant aid to the most impacted students. We want to thank the student leaders who were on the task force for their thoughtful contributions to the decision-making process and for ensuring that student voices were heard. We are also grateful to the federal government for providing UCLA $18 million in CARES funding to specifically support student needs, and an additional $18 million for more general institutional support, which UCLA plans on using to help preserve jobs to maintain our teaching mission. Please visit MyUCLA to initiate the process to receive a universal impact award and apply for need-based financial aid. We are all one UCLA family, and we will continue to rely on each other to get through these trying times. In true Bruin spirit, we will do it together.

There are five committees charged with managing the re-entry/recovery process. The leads from each of those committees will meet once a week and will act as an advisory group to the President and Cabinet. In addition, each Vice President will provide more detailed information to their division about their specific re-entry plans within the UNT System and university-level guidance. The committees are: academics, research, student life, facilities and operations, and health and safety. Additional information will be shared as plans are developed and finalized.

Student Health and Wellness Center (SHWC) Update:

The SHWC is available for students for all appointment reasons, without restrictions, including Walk-In STD testing. The hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.
The SHWC has expanded its telemedicine visits with medical providers, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and the dietitian. Not all issues are appropriate for this type of visit, so call and check on specifics.
The SHWC has implemented new precautions to protect the health and safety of students and staff. One notable addition is a mobile nurse’s station on the first floor of Chestnut Hall to take patient temperatures and confirm students have some type of face covering before entering the reception area on the 2nd floor. All staff will be wearing either a cloth face covering or a mask and have their temperature monitored each day. We also have increased our already aggressive cleaning protocols for all areas and high-touch surfaces as well as installed several large sneeze guards throughout the clinic.
The SHWC Pharmacy is available for students and staff with regular hours and additional safety precautions mentioned above.
Most SHWC staff, minus a few administrative employees continuing to telecommute, are back in the clinic, ready to assist students with any healthcare related need.
The SHWC Meadows Center for Health Resources will remain closed for the immediate future.
When UNT’s Risk Management Services put out a call on campus for supplies for mask making efforts, departments generously responded by donating UNT bandanas and rally towels. Watch this video to see how the Wise Mask Makers, volunteer seamstresses from Wise County, are using the fabric to make more than 350 masks for the UNT community.

Don’t forget to follow the CDC’s recommendations and wear your cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 to keep yourself and others safe.

Dining and Retail Update:

Dining Services will keep this schedule through Sunday, May 24, and retail hours will remain unchanged through May 31. In addition, Kerr Dining Hall will be closed May 25-31. It will re-open June 1 for Summer 5W1 and plans are being made to re-open additional retail options as more faculty/staff return to campus.

Jordan Williams, senior communications specialist in Lifelong Learning and Community Engagement, has gone above and beyond to help keep members for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) and the UNT Retiree Association both intellectually and socially engaged during the trying times of COVID-19.

Seniors are one of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to our current health crisis. Because of this, OLLI at UNT and UNTRA members are sheltering in place and not venturing out much at all. Jordan is keeping them intellectually stimulated by providing them with educational content that can be viewed from the safety of their own homes. He also is providing meaningful content through social media for them as well. He also has helped facilitate a Phone Pal program where OLLI at UNT Ambassadors call other members for friendly conversation. This program was created to help seniors who are feeling socially isolated.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response:

Wendy Middlemiss, Ph.D., associate professor of Educational Psychology, wrote with the following recognition:

Our University and College of Education house the state office for the Home Instruction of Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY). HIPPY is a home visiting program providing families with activities helping at-risk children gain school readiness skills. Our state office oversees 11 program sites stretching from the DFW area to the Rio Grande Valley.

For Adriana Trevino, our director, and Janie Rojas, assistant director, the stay-at-home orders were met with an all-encompassing question: “What happens to a home visiting program when you can't visit a home?”

Since mid-March, as districts and agencies closed their doors, Adriana and Janie spent hour upon hour answering that question for each of the 11 unique sites, often working well into the evening hours. They helped sites initiate plans for virtual home visits or home visits by phone for communities with limited Internet access. Our directors helped sites assure that their AmeriCorps-member home visitors remained in active status, and thus continued earning both an income and their education awards.

For Adriana and Janie, efforts to meet these program needs often paled in the face of finding ways of relieving the anxiety and stress experienced in each community. It is only because of their tireless dedication and hard work that HIPPY continues to provide for children’s educational needs and family well-being across our state.

To achieve these positive outcomes, Adriana and Janie attended numerous webinars learning the ins and outs of both HIPPY and AmeriCorps expectations. As well, they helped submit a federal planning grant proposal [which received approval and funding just this week] to help the program meet changing needs. Their efforts and hopefulness represent UNT’s community spirit in this time of need.

Bridget O’Brien, assistant director of the Child Development Laboratory, would like to recognize Benjamin Hanisian for all of his hard work on the UNT Rec Sports “Keep Moving” Initiative. He is the assistant director of Departmental Marketing and Communications at Rec Sports and has done an excellent job migrating their fitness programs online and setting up their website to keep staff and students active, healthy, and involved; even from afar.

I feel he has gone above and beyond on this huge project, as he updates the site weekly with “Workout Plans of the Week,” which include a schedule of daily Zoom and YouTube Virtual Workout Classes (and even demonstration warm-up videos to watch beforehand!). He has made sure to post a variety of classes, times, and even suggestions for creative ways to adapt your workout at home, which is very inclusive and thoughtful of those with limited resources.

On top of this, he has an excellent social media presence on all platforms, including daily schedule reminders, motivational posts, and Instagram Live workouts.

His work on this project has given the university body a very comprehensive online fitness program that not only helps keep us active and motivated, but helps us feel connected to one another. This reliable, user-friendly resource has been very beneficial for me and many of my co-workers at UNT as we navigate working from home while trying to stay physically and mentally fit.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response

From Hepi Wachter, Ph.D., professor and chair in the Department of Design in the College of Visual Arts and Design:

I feel CVAD’s fashion design programis going above and beyond as we wrap up the semester. Professors Trippeer, Chang, Gam and Otto had a lot to “lift” transferring the fashion design senior show. (In the past, we would have enjoyed a fashion show in the Union.)

They have all been working hard to ensure student success, and in particular, aid our seniors to navigate what will obviously be a challenging transition into the industry.

Since restrictions were enacted during spring break and all senior fashion show exhibition opportunities were moved online, the fashion program was quick to enact their own form of the innovation imperative, and as such they have been strategically preparing our seniors to enter the workforce and get their materials out into the public without “running the show.”

As of April 22, each fashion design senior has not only completed a full digital online web-based portfolio, but also set up full LinkedIn profiles that are actively being used to engage with the fashion design industry. In lieu of the mounted show, they are developing it on www.untfashiondesigngrads.com by mid-May.

After weeks of intensive training through mock interview sessions, both in one-on-one sessions and through peers as small groups, the students are now “ready” to test their materials and solicit additional industry feedback.

As of last week, every single student has completed at least one information interview (and perhaps a few more) through our industry alumni network, and associated industry contact list.

We have also done thorough training on how to maximize key job search engines which exist in open source format (such as LinkedIn networking and Google Grow’s new job search platform), as well as other primary sources for industry networking (WWD, BOF, Fashion United, and StykeCareers).

Rather serendipitously, this unique moment and perhaps positive fallout of COVID-19 has allowed us to put more stress on these modes of delivery, which are often used as communication platforms, and based on current restrictions, will continue to become key survival skills. We believe they will become part of the “new-normal.”

I would like to bring to your attention my supervisor, Raylon Dukes. Ever since the sent-home order was put into place, he has been coming to campus and still doing his daily duties instead of working from home, covering every issue that popped up in the field. He has kept us updated as well as the student workers who are still here and checks on those that have chosen to go home abroad. Raylon is very caring and giving. He would give you the shirt off his back. He always makes sure everyone around him is always ok, by keeping us supplied with masks and sanitizer. He is definitely the backbone of this department. I am proud to be his lead. He has taught me so much. He is a great mentor to us all. He is the T in TEAM. He is not one for praise, so he would credit us for the success we share here in Auxiliary HVAC, but it is because of his heart and caring for his people that we succeed.

It has been almost two months since I last saw you on our beautiful campus. I miss you and the hustle and bustle of campus life. During this time, we have all been adapting to virtual services, remote and online classes, and shelter in place. I hope you are doing well, that you are staying safe and healthy, and are making progress. Like me, I suspect you are looking forward to being together again to live, learn, and enjoy our rich campus experience.

Our leadership teams have been working hard to help us begin the transition from remote learning back to more normal campus operations. Today, I want to inform you that we plan to begin limited in-person teaching as early as Summer II and are planning on safely resuming campus learning and residential life for Fall 2020.

As we plan for our return to campus, the new normal will be different. Your safety is our top priority, and we will take every precaution to keep our community safe in this new world. We are assessing options and precautions for eventually returning to campus for all in-person activities and programs, ranging from lab-based research to general instruction and the undergraduate residential experience. Of course, these plans depend on continuing improvement in COVID-19 cases, and guidance from federal, state, and local health authorities to ensure your safety. We will be communicating in the coming weeks about what exactly you can expect when you return to campus.

This global health crisis also has had a financial impact on all of us. I want you to know if you need help of any kind you can get access to our many services at the Start Green Stay Green website (https://www.unt.edu/staygreen). We are here for you through these challenging times. Many of you have been hit hard by the current economy, and we are doing our best to balance easing financial burdens with providing the top quality UNT education and experience you deserve. If you are experiencing financial insecurity, please apply for assistance from our emergency grants-in-aid program available through the CARES Act. These funds are available now and are meant to help you pay your bills so you can stay in school and earn your degree as planned. Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA.

Despite the many weeks apart, we have become an even stronger, more connected UNT community through this shared adversity.

When Osman received notification that the campus was closing, he took it upon himself to convert one of the center’s most popular classroom-based programs — Financial Intelligence Training — to an online version accessible through Canvas. FIT is a three-part series that helps students strengthen their foundational money management skills. More than 130 students have registered for the Canvas-based program.

Goebel says the outreach team has worked incessantly over the past weeks to develop, design and introduce new online and virtual educational programs for students while the campus is closed.

Chair Lauren Lake and her team — Angela Hamilton-Vanecek, Ann Howington and Gustavo Plascencia — have gone above and beyond in their efforts to help students and professors adapt to the current crisis.

There are a number of major challenges to adapting studio art classes to online formats, not to mention the challenges facing graduating students who were planning to exhibit their work. Lake and her team have handled this as well as anyone could have.

Diana Farris commends Dr. Chris Lam in the Technical Communications department, who has been amazing throughout this entire process. From the very beginning, he has shown sincere compassion and understanding towards his students. Early on, when housing plans were uncertain for some students, he reached out offering to help them find a place to stay. “He has also done an excellent job of transferring our course from in-person to online,” says assistant to the dean Diana Farris. “I don’t feel as though course quality has diminished at all. He has been present, available and proactive, which has made the transition seamless. His kindness and leadership have been comforting during these uncertain times.”

Be Mean Green Ready for severe weather at UNT

Severe weather can occur at any time of the year, but the North Texas region sees a more significant threat during spring months. Preparation for storms, tornados and other severe weather is key. Below are some tips to help the UNT community become Mean Green Ready for severe weather!

Update your Eagle Alert information

All UNT community members are automatically enrolled in the emergency messaging system for campus, Eagle Alert, but can choose the best emails or telephone numbers for contact information. UNT System staff are automatically signed up to receive Eagle Alerts based on their office location and can choose to receive alerts from other UNT System locations if they would like to do so. Keep Eagle Alert information up to date at my.unt.edu (students and faculty) or my.untsystem.edu (staff). Also follow @UNTEagleAlert on Twitter to get up to date information.

Be 'Weather Aware' at all times

Check on weather conditions and understand weather impacts. When severe weather is in the forecast, keep an eye on the weather through the National Weather Service or by following Emergency Management and Safety Services on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Know where to go

Identify the nearest shelter areas. Shelter areas are designated for every building on campus and can be viewed at UNT Emergency Floor Plans or via the UNT Mean Green Ready App.

Understand the difference between a watch and a warning

A watch means that conditions are favorable for a particular type of weather. A warning means that the weather event is under way. Here are some common severe weather terms:

Severe thunderstorm watch: A severe thunderstorm is possible. Be weather aware and stay tuned to local radio/TV for information.
Severe thunderstorm warning: A severe thunderstorm is happening or imminent. Get indoors immediately and stay tuned to local radio/TV for more information.
Tornado watch: A tornado is possible. Know where you’ll take shelter if you have to. Be weather aware and stay tuned to local radio/TV for information.
Tornado warning: A tornado is happening or imminent. Take shelter immediately and stay in your shelter until the warning has ended.
Learn what to do and about available resources

Visit UNT Emergency Management and NWS Weather Safety for more information about severe weather and the tools available to help with preparedness efforts. Visit KnoWhat2Do to make an emergency plan. Follow UNT Emergency Management (@MeanGreenReady) on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for the most up-to-date safety and weather information for UNT Denton, Discovery Park, and the New College at Frisco.

Take an emergency readiness training class, provided by Emergency Management and Safety Services and the UNT Police Department. Fill out a training request form to learn more about this valuable training.

Any staff member:

whose job is not conducive to telecommuting;

This time reporting of emergency leave began March 25, the first date the campus was closed to nonessential personnel, as all staff should have been able to be on campus to perform their jobs prior to that date.

She kept track of many things, from equipment requests to remote teaching forms, time reporting and more. Kristi also mixed together her own cleaning materials when we weren't able to buy it anymore. As the last woman standing in an otherwise deserted department, she even delivered teaching equipment and other items to people — or met them in the Walmart parking lot — after work! She traveled as far as Keller to make sure all employees had what they needed to succeed remotely.

https://www.unt.edu/notices/help-so-you-can-succeed-message-president,15-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT students,

As educators, our purpose is you. We spend every day focused on helping each of you thrive, and we revel in your creativity, tenacity and brilliance. Our world has been shaken and that calls for a change in how we support you. We recognize that one of the biggest burdens many students are facing right now is financial insecurity. In an effort to ease some of the economic strain you may be experiencing, I want to let you know how UNT is trying to help.

First, we have made changes to the cost of enrolling in summer courses. For summer 2020 sessions, students will not have to pay some of the typical mandatory fees that help fund several support services on campus. This includes waivers of the Recreational Facility Fee, Student Union Fee, Medical Services Fee, Transportation Fee and Athletics Fee. We are able to do this because we have moved all in-person classes scheduled for the May session, Summer I and full summer sessions to online/remote delivery. Students can take advantage of these summer sessions and reduced costs to save money and stay on track to graduate on time.

Second, as you may already be aware, the federal government has provided a boost in student aid through the CARES Act. This funding allows us to greatly expand our emergency grants-in-aid program. This need-based aid is available for currently enrolled students as well as students who enroll in UNT summer sessions. The funds are intended to help students pay their bills and stay in school so they can earn their degrees as planned.

Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA. And, you can learn more about the cost of summer sessions by contacting Student Financial Services at sfs@unt.edu, online chat at sfs.unt.edu or by calling 940-565-3225.

I realize that emergency aid and fee waivers won't solve every problem. Times are tough, but so is our Mean Green Family. We will keep working on creative solutions to unprecedented problems. We will keep finding fresh ways to bring you the world-class education you deserve. You won't have to make it through these tough times alone. We're here to help you thrive because that's what we do.

Van Cross of the Facilities Custodial Team works a tough schedule: Way, way before sunrise until lunchtime. He’s been working during the pandemic to sanitize campus buildings, stock restrooms and accomplish small cleaning projects taking advantage of the vacant buildings across UNT.

One recent morning, while preparing for a special cleaning project, he heard dripping water in the Environmental Education, Science and Technology Building and discovered a failed research system pumping water into the building. Mr. Cross notified a stand-by technician to get the leak stopped, contacted his supervisor and manager to rally a team to assist and began gathering and using water extraction equipment.

Responding to COVID-19 and its impact on our entire campus community has been a herculean effort, but today we are acknowledging a few areas that have been on the front line 24/7 since it began.

In particular, thank you to all staff in Emergency Management, Facilities, Housing and UNT Police for their dedicated service during this global health crisis. Each of these units are supporting critical crisis response and/or business continuity in ways that are not always visible but certainly always necessary.

https://www.unt.edu/notices/unt-official-message-providing-undergraduate-students-passno-pass-grading-option,2-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT students:

Many of you have expressed a desire to have Pass/No Pass options for all Spring 2020 undergraduate courses. I appreciate you taking the time to share your feelings with us, as well as your patience while we worked through the logistics. For your benefit, we have made the following changes applicable to Spring 2020 undergraduate courses:

Undergraduate students can choose either the university’s regular A-F grading scheme or Pass/No Pass for Spring 2020 courses on their academic record.
Students earning grades A-C will have these grades posted to their record at the time of grading. A student can elect to change their A-C grades to a Pass after grades post.
Students earning a grade of D or F will have a grade of No Pass entered by a faculty member, unless the student notifies their instructor otherwise before grading. Students can elect to change the No Pass grade back to the D or F after grades post.
Students can make different choices for different classes, choosing to keep some letter grades, and choosing others to remain Pass/No Pass.
Letter grades will continue to calculate in a student’s grade point average. Pass and No Pass options do not calculate in grade point averages.
Students will have until 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 14, to select a change to Pass for letter grades and to change No Pass grades back to a D or F based on the grade earned.
For graduate students, each graduate program is prepared to provide flexibility, as appropriate, to support student success.

To learn more about the Pass/No Pass Option, visit https://registrar.unt.edu/grades. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisor prior to making any grade election decisions.

I hope these changes bring relief to some of the stress you are feeling. I know life is filled with uncertainty right now. Many of us are worried about our health, our loved ones and our finances. But some things always hold strong and true: the knowledge you gain and the Mean Green threads tying each of us tightly together. We help one another. We listen to one another. You are never walking alone. We are, and always will be, a family.

https://www.unt.edu/notices/covid-19-update-9,2-Apr-2020,"Campus officials have been notified of two additional, confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UNT.

One of the cases involves a staff member, who has no interaction with students and very little interaction with other university staff. It has been approximately 10 days since the individual last worked on campus, and any potential impacted parties have been notified.

The other case is a UNT student living alone in off-campus housing who has not been on campus since mid-March. The student already has completed the mandatory self-isolation and any potential impacted parties have been notified.

It is very important to follow the guidelines set forth by Denton County’s shelter-at-home order. Students living in residence halls must comply. The order only allows them to leave for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, picking up meals from campus dining, visiting a healthcare professional, or engaging in outdoor activity such as walking, hiking, running or riding a bicycle – with proper social distancing.

UNT officials have received reports of reduced service levels with some online platforms such as Zoom as more organizations worldwide reduce in-person meetings. Stories include having trouble with being kicked out of Zoom meetings or experiencing audio or video issues.

CIO Chris McCoy suggests turning off your VPN if you are using a UNT laptop and minimizing the number of applications running in the background. Zoom uses a considerable amount of memory, and open apps can result in processing issues. Since Zoom is a cloud service, VPN video data is encrypted and routed through campus firewalls before being sent unencrypted back out onto the internet to the Zoom servers. By turning VPN off, computers off campus are communicating directly with the Zoom servers without being routed through the campus.

Finally, when you run Zoom on an iPad, it is only running Zoom, not multiple apps.

https://www.unt.edu/notices/unts-resilient-caring-community-pulls-together-message-president,2-Apr-2020,"Dear UNT family,

There is no handbook for handling a global pandemic. There is no guide for navigating a world flipped upside down and inside out. We are human and with that humanity comes anxiety, vulnerability, fears, stress and selfishness. But when I look at our UNT community, those are not the traits I see. We are strong, resilient, brave, determined, creative, unified and selfless. Our Mean Green family was made to tackle times exactly like these.

I want to take a moment to share with you some of the examples of hope I’ve seen from our community in recent weeks. With less than two months remaining in the semester, our faculty halted their entire worlds and reimagined nearly 8,000 courses to find creative solutions to very unique problems. Our faculty stepped into the discomfort of the unknown because being there for our students who need to finish the semester successfully is more important. None of these herculean efforts would be possible without the support staff across the university, many of whom are tackling a variety of issues to keep our university going for our students and our community — and most are doing this from their own newly adapted home office environments. None of these changes have been simple or easy, but every single issue we’ve addressed has been to help our students succeed.

To all UNT students, you inspire us every day. You are the reason we continue moving forward. You, too, have hurdled countless obstacles and adapted to an ever-changing reality while admirably managing many stressors. You have done so with fearless spirit. Keep going. We are ready to help you climb mountains. You need only ask.

We also have hundreds of students who continue to call our campus residence halls home. To the staff who are caring for those students, feeding and housing them, protecting them, you are the epitome of the community values we hold dear. To the students, we remain sensitive to the toll this unprecedented crisis is having on you who are having to adjust not only in your learning but in many cases now are unable to work or be with your families. If you would like to show your support during these challenging times, we’ve established a special fund to help our students with immediate and pressing needs.

Our values also are evident among our alumni, who are proving that we truly are all Eagles for life. Once again, “Mattress Mack” Jim McIngvale is providing for the Houston community — this time by distributing meals to children and seniors. Lecrae has joined forces with the organization Love Beyond Walls to set up handwashing stations in Atlanta for the homeless; and fashion designer Khanh Nguyen has taken fabric she normally uses for her stunning wedding gowns to sew masks for health care professionals in Dallas.

You can read more about our alumni and some of their amazing efforts in supporting others during this crisis, as well as take time to read about university happenings in the spring issue of the North Texan magazine online. You also can find inspirational stories about our faculty, staff and students here. We will continue to post more of these online as we collect them and encourage all of you to share with us how you or someone you know has been making a difference during this time.

I continue to be amazed every day by the support, resilience and ingenuity displayed by our students, staff, faculty and alumni when every hour seems to bring more change and more necessary adaptations. Continue to care for one another. Continue to help each other through these challenges. As difficult as it may feel in this moment, we are becoming a stronger, more connected community through this shared experience. Let’s stay together in spirit and unity of purpose as the Mean Green family I am so very proud to call my own.

I know that the COVID-19 outbreak is impacting you deeply, and I hope you are doing well as we find new ways to support your progress. I hope you are all staying safe and are doing your best to take care of each other and your families.

Those of you who rely on income from campus jobs have expressed your concerns over whether we will be able to provide you with financial assistance. The short answer is we will provide support to all student workers who were employed in the week before spring break, but have been unable to return to work because of the pandemic.

You will be paid 20 hours per week for the first two weeks of April. This paycheck will come to you in the same manner in which you received your most recent paycheck; either via direct deposit or mail, on May 1. We want to help you be successful and will continue to look for resources for students who have critical needs.

In the interim, please be aware the UNT Career Center has created a central repository to match students in need of hours with units across the university with available work. The Career Center also is helping match students with part-time employment in the community, when possible. We also asked departments to stop hiring new student employees until we find work for our displaced students. Finally, there also are resources from the City of Denton for those seeking employment.

Please know that even if you don’t have hours now, you still could have a campus position when the university is fully operational again – pending approval from your supervisor. We encourage you to reach out to your direct supervisor with specific questions regarding your position and contact the Career Center for general questions and guidance.

If you are facing financial hardship due to this crisis, contact the Student Money Management Center, Dean of Students Office and Student Legal Services to be connected with resources. UNT’s Start Green Stay Green program also is a resource for students seeking options for financial assistance.

Your Mean Green Family is here to support you in every way we can during this challenging time.

They’re seeing patients every single day from check-in to check-out, caring for students, calming fears and anxieties, treating illnesses and injuries — all while trying to keep themselves safe.

Other new duties include calling the long list of students, staff and faculty who have traveled or reported showing symptoms to make sure our UNT community stays as safe and healthy as possible, as well as developing telemedicine procedures (including telepsychiatry) to serve students who can’t or shouldn’t physically come into the clinic. Fields-Hawkins is fortunate enough to be able to do much of her job from home, but many of her coworkers are in the clinic right now making sure our students get the care they need. SHWC staff risk putting their health and the health of their families on the line because of their dedication to our students – their patients.

“We wouldn’t exist without our patients, so we’re not going to let them down when they need us,” Fields-Hawkins says. “The UNT community is home, and we will always stand with our family.”

Ralf joined our department only this past fall from another institution, but he very quickly earned the trust of our faculty, staff and graduate students and, before the “coronacrisis” hit, had already started transforming the department in a positive way. But these last few weeks, his calm and steady leadership has truly made a difference. Day by day, he kept everyone informed with clear emails detailing step by step what we needed to do next, sometimes even with a measured dose of humor. He also constructed a webpage with helpful tips for teaching online. Moreover, he went out of his way to ensure that all instructional personnel had the necessary resources to start teaching online, ordering tablets, webcams and document cameras for whoever needed them, and with his physical presence he kept up morale among the staff who had to keep coming into the office until the very last moment when the department was already a ghost town.

We understand that for some students, UNT is their home and, as such, we have an added responsibility to ensure their health and safety on our campus. We will continue to maintain specific, essential, on-campus services for students who need them, including:

Meal service for our on-campus residents will be provided with to-go options from Kerr Cafeteria.
The Union is closed with the exception of Eagle Post, which is open 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response

UNT student Kelly Schmidt wants to give a shout out to her supervisor, Brecken Wellborn, at the Learning Center. Kelly wrote the following:

“He is the director of Tutoring Services and has been working overtime to keep all his student employees connected, safe, and up-to-date during this scary time. Transitioning all of the Learning Center's tutoring services to online offerings in the space of a week and coordinating the changing schedules of 10 different tutors and their appointments was a huge task, but he has managed it amazingly well. I think all of my fellow employees would agree that he goes above and beyond for UNT and for us, and that he deserves some recognition.”

If you know of someone who is going above and beyond, please share their information with untpresident@unt.edu so we can give them a shout out.

Yesterday, we went live with more than 7,700 classes that transitioned from face-to-face to online. I want everyone to understand that it was an amazing effort and our faculty and staff deserve a big round of applause for their hard work in getting us to this point. Of course, no change as fast and sweeping as this goes off without a hitch, and we expect technical, logistic, and human error issues as we all work through this change together.

In particular, we might anticipate bandwidth limitations from some of our third-party providers, as well as challenges in the homes of our students and faculty as they teach and learn anywhere. So, I ask your forbearance as we work through the many small and large challenges that we will be facing this week. We will do our best to iron them out and will make sure that classes will proceed, and students can complete their semester.

The safety and health of our students and entire university community is our primary focus.

Important takeaways for you:

Residence halls and dining services – with social distancing in mind – will stay open for those who wish to remain in our care. The Student Health and Wellness clinic also with social distancing in place will be open.
For those who choose to leave the residence halls, please continue to use the check-out sign-up form.
The UNT Food Pantry in Crumley Hall is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
We have moved all of our support services to an online format to serve our students, whether they are living on-campus or completing coursework afar. These options include email, telephone and Zoom or other video chat services.
Student employees are being directed to reach out to their supervisors directly to discuss telecommuting and other options.
For general questions and concerns, please reach out to the Parent and Family Hotline at 844-366-5892. The hotline is available 10 a.m. to 2. p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays and 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday.

The campus will transition to only essential operations and we will move all other campus offices to virtual service delivery by 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, March 24.

UNT employees who do not fall into the essential personnel category for being on campus and are unable to do their work from home – as determined by your vice president and supervisor – will be reassigned to other duties or receive emergency leave through Friday, April 3. If health-related restrictions have not changed, the length of emergency leave will be evaluated at that time.

We began this intense effort to support our community’s safety by extending spring break and moving classes online. It has been truly amazing to watch the teamwork by faculty and staff as we moved quickly to take care of each other and our students. We have also taken measures to ensure that our resident students are not unilaterally displaced, rather that we continued to provide a safe haven for those with the need or desire to remain in our care.

We are living through an unprecedented global event the likes of which we have rarely seen in the 130-year history of our university. The personal impact on each of us and our normal routine on and off campus is great, which is why I am writing to share news about Commencement with you today.

After much consideration, I have decided to postpone Commencement ceremonies that were scheduled for May 7-10. Our spring commencement is the last major event to be impacted, and the decision was not made quickly in order to thoroughly consider whether we could begin returning to normal operations in early May. While we should all remain optimistic about where we could be with the fight against coronavirus (COVID-19) in 45 days, families of May graduates need to know now whether to make travel arrangements.

I know that crossing the stage is a defining moment for our students who have worked so hard to earn their degree(s), so please know that many people across campus are currently reviewing ways to still allow commencement to happen later in the year for any graduate wishing to participate. Whatever is decided, spring graduates will have an opportunity to participate in an in-person ceremony and cross the stage at a commencement ceremony, but you will officially graduate regardless of whether we hold a ceremony or not. As soon as we make a decision regarding these later ceremony options, we will share that information with our community.

For students who still need answers regarding our transition to online instruction, including such topics as the availability of laptops and textbooks, please visit our frequently asked questions page on the healthalerts.unt.edu website.

Thank you for your patience as we work together to allow our students to complete the current semester over the coming weeks. I understand that this is a difficult time for them, their families, and our faculty and staff, but we are pulling together and solving problems as they arise in a way that demonstrates our caring and creative UNT spirit.

https://www.unt.edu/notices/unt-community-won-t-tolerate-harassment-official-notice-president,19-Mar-2020,"Dear UNT community members,

Amid growing concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19 infections across the world and the United States, there has been an increase in the number of reports regarding stereotyping, harassment, and bullying directed toward students and faculty perceived to be of Chinese-American or, more generally, Asian descent. It is important for us to pause for a moment and consider how our thoughts, our words, and our actions influence others in our community who are equally affected by this global health crisis.

As we all know, words can hurt, and can substantially interfere with our students' educational access and our employees’ work opportunities. UNT will not tolerate harassing behavior toward our community members who are or may appear to be of Asian descent. Let me be clear when I state that this is not who we are as a community.

As we move into online instruction, we expect UNT students, faculty, staff, and administrators to refrain from any identity-based jokes, slurs, harassment, or exclusion against any member of the Mean Green Family. The UNT policy on “Prohibition of Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation” is still in effect despite these new ways of learning and working and will be enforced. Should you experience or witness a violation of this policy committed by a student, we encourage you to report it to the Dean of Students Office at report.unt.edu. Suspected violations committed by faculty or staff members should be reported to Equal Opportunity.

Now more than ever, it's important that we live our mission and our values: to be a caring community that creates and maintains an inclusive and equitable learning and working environment for collaborative educational innovation. In this time of crisis, it is essential that we are ever more vigilant in our commitment to these values.

UNT remains committed to being a caring community for all its students and employees and committed to building a world where all of humanity is treated with dignity and respect.

Students will be responsible for making sure they complete the work required to complete the semester. While classes are being shifted online, there are limited cases where in-person instruction will continue. In those cases, there will be specific measures to account for student and faculty safety using social distancing. If students have a class that requires equipment or software only available at UNT, instructors will provide guidance.

UNT officials have received reports of reduced service levels with some online platforms such as Zoom as more organizations worldwide reduce in-person meetings, instruction, etc. Since the issue is not with university-delivered services, there is very little that can be done to remedy the issue. However, alternate ways of conducting meetings and classes is always a consideration, and information will be relayed as it becomes available.

Vendors are adjusting their capacity to meet global demand, but home Internet services may also experience congestion due to increased demand. We expect demand to level off as people adjust to working from home.

UNT Police would like the campus community to know that police services will not be reduced. An online reporting option is available athttps://police.unt.edu/reportcrime. Community members can also make a report or speak to an officer by telephone by calling 940-565-3003. All emergencies should continue to be reported by calling 911.

As you are likely aware, new federal guidelines were released Monday, March 16, that recommend gatherings be limited to 10 or fewer individuals. As a result, we are moving to further limit interaction on campus with the following measures:

All remaining, university-sponsored, in-person events on campus are canceled effective immediately. No decision has been made regarding May Commencement ceremonies.
In-person meetings should follow current federal guidelines. If possible, all, or a majority, of participants should use Zoom, conference calls or another alternative form of communication.
In consultation with division vice presidents, supervisors should finalize plans for employees to telecommute, where possible, and increase rotation of staff on and off campus in situations where some staff are needed on-site for business continuity.  
As quickly as possible, we are moving to mostly electronic approvals to replace paper forms that often travel through multiple individuals.

There are no confirmed cases at UNT or in Denton County at this time, but we have seen reported cases in Collin, Dallas and Tarrant counties over the past week. As a result, we are taking the following steps to protect our campus community:

UNT will cancel all in-person classes at all locations for the week of March 16-22, as the university transitions to online or alternative instructional delivery.
Online classes and field experiences will continue as normal the week of March 16-22.

In addition, we are taking these precautions involving travel and events: 

We are suspending university-sponsored international travel until further notice.
Only domestic travel necessary for essential business continuity will be supported until further notice. Guidelines for essential business continuity travel will be established by the Vice Presidents of each area. 
Faculty, staff or students returning from countries with travel restrictions or visiting our campus from a country with travel restrictions will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days, with monitoring provided by our Student Health and Wellness Center.
We ask all employees and students returning from personal international travel or highly impacted areas domestically to please report their trip to international risk control at 940-369-6154 for further guidance.
Beginning March 23, events with more than 250 people that don’t affect business continuity will be canceled or postponed.

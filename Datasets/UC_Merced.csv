February 4, 2020
Information regarding the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues to evolve. We are writing today to keep you informed of the latest from the University of California, public health officials, governmental entities and others.
 
There have been no reported cases of coronavirus in Merced. UC Merced has established a working group in collaboration with the Merced County Department of Public Health and Office of Emergency Services, as well as other health authorities, to share information, take preventative steps and keep our campus community safe.
 
Regarding travel, the State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory (do not travel) for China, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to China. University of California President Janet Napolitano has issued a directive that UC limit non-essential travel to China. If you have scheduled travel to China that you believe is essential to university business, please contact Risk Services Manager Cindi Zimmerman, czimmerman3@ucmerced.edu , for guidance.
 
We will update the campus community as relevant information becomes available. Please check the Health Services and Emergency Management websites for updates as well.

28-Feb-20,457,"UPDATE: What You Need to Know About COVID-19
February 28, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. While we are all aware of growing concerns about COVID-19 (also called the coronavirus), as of today, no one in Merced County or on the UC Merced campus has tested positive for COVID-19.
Campus administrators are discussing this issue every day, gathering information from a variety of sources and considering new measures we might take to keep this campus safe and healthy.  
All students seeking care at the Student Health Center are being asked about recent travel and contact with people with known COVID-19, and we have recently broadened our screening practices in line with updated guidance from medical authorities. Additionally, we continue to work closely with and follow the guidance of the Merced County and California public health departments. Staff and faculty seeking care should consult their primary care provider.
You may have heard there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a Solano County resident who is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. This case is being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as possibly the first with no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual. Because of the precautions in place since this patient’s arrival, UC Davis believes there has been minimal potential for exposure at the medical center.
We would encourage you to keep yourself informed with credible information. Here are some resources you may find helpful:
UC Merced COVID-19 Information
UC Merced Student Health Center
Merced County Department of Public Health
CDC Information 
Practice daily preventative care:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Stay home if you are sick.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work and school.
Practice healthy habits: Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.
If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu.
While the progression of COVID-19 is still emerging, the CDC is reporting that for the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is low.
Again, we are taking all necessary precautions and are working with public health officials. We ask you to be kind and respectful to one another, as our Principles of Community guide our behaviors and interactions. We will continue to provide you with updates as more information becomes available.

As we continue to monitor the situation, we are also working on plans related to the continuity of research, academics and operations. Our colleagues across campus will be communicating important information about those plans to faculty, staff and students over the coming days and weeks. Please take the time to read all these communications, and ask questions if you have them.
If you are experiencing fever, cough, and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, please stay home, and call your healthcare provider to make an appointment. Students can call the Student Health Center at 209-228-2273. It is important to always call before arriving for your appointment.
If you plan to travel, please stay up to date on the university’s latest travel advisories, which currently recommend avoiding nonessential travel to China, Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea. Please be sure to provide family and friends with your itinerary and contact information, as travel restrictions and flight schedules can change rapidly.
And while it is understandable to feel concern about COVID-19, it is critical to ensure you are receiving information from credible sources. Here are some resources you may find helpful:

March 8, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Due to increasing concern regarding COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) and arising from our responsibility to keep our community healthy and safe, UC Merced is issuing this guidance for all international and domestic travel as well as a reminder of current University of California travel directives.
• All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmission), must be submitted in writing to Risk Manager Cindi Zimmerman for approval by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Gregg Camfield, prior to scheduling travel. 
This is consistent with UC President Napolitano’s directive to avoid all non-essential travel to CDC Level 3 and 2 countries.
• All university-related international travel must be registered with UC Away (also called the UC International Travel Registry). UC Away is the University of California’s portal to register university-related and personal travel.
Registration enables the university to leverage benefits and protections in case an incident arises that requires medical care, evacuation, or other essential services.
• The university strongly discourages all non-essential domestic or international travel until further notice; this includes both university-related and personal travel.
• If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely (e.g., via online platforms or teleconference) or delay travel to a later date.
• If you decide to travel outside the United States, please be aware that the CDC may issue new international travel warnings without notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry.
• The university strongly recommends that all domestic travel be registered with UC Away; this includes both university-related and personal travel. 
For university-related, domestic travel booked through UC Connexxus, trips are automatically registered with UC Away. However, travel booked through other means will need to be manually registered with UC Away.
• For personal travel, faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to register with UC Away. 
• Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.
• Anyone who has currently booked or is planning to book any travel, international or domestic, should consult with her or his supervisor as soon as possible.
We ask that everyone remain informed about measures to prevent infection and regularly monitor the most up-to-date UC Merced information.

9-Mar-20,489,"COVID-19 Instructional Continuity
March 9, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of the coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but currently, there is no reason for us to suspend ordinary instructional activity; in-person classroom meetings will be under normal operations.
 
The Senate leadership and academic administration have been working together on contingency plans should the COVID-19 impact our campus. The plans anticipate different levels of impact ranging from individual students or instructors who are sick and/or quarantined, and unable to attend classes, to complete closure of the campus.
 
In general, our principles are:
Placing primacy on your safety and the safety of your students;
Ensuring student completion of coursework in a timely manner;
Equitable treatment of students; and,
Use of technologies that are supported by the campus, in particular CatCourses and Zoom.
 
The application of these principles to COVID-19 related disruptions will require all of us to be flexible with deadlines, types of assignments, and modes of instructional delivery. In the meantime, we strongly encourage all instructors to do the following:
 
Talk with your students and TAs about the possibility of COVID-19 disruptions and assure them that we are prioritizing their safety and the completion of the classes. Explain that this may require the types of flexibility discussed above.
 
Determine a course of action for your class should you, a student, or the entire class need to participate remotely.
 
Familiarize yourself and your students with the functionalities of CatCourses and Zoom that may need to be used to deliver course content. The Office of Information Technology has established a website to guide you in the appropriate use of these technologies. The Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning will be available for consultation.
 
Should it be necessary, the Senate has approved a policy to be used when the Provost and the Senate Chair agree there is an emergency necessitating suspension of normal instructional operations. We will inform you if and when we are invoking the policy. The policy is available here .
 
We know you will have concerns about the welfare of your families, staff, and your research. UC Merced has established a website for COVID-19 related information and resources. The site also includes a question function that will be monitored to direct your questions to the appropriate experts.
 
Some additional resources you may find helpful include:

We will continue to monitor this evolving situation and work with campus partners to ensure you have the resources necessary for instructional continuity. We realize these are times of uncertainty and concern and we thank you for your patience and wisdom in navigating these challenges.

This decision comes after careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals in Merced County and within the University of California system.

10-Mar-20,650,"COVID-19 and Research Continuity at UC Merced
March 10, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
The Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) has established a set of business continuity plans for the research enterprise should the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impact our campus. These plans are staged, based on the severity of such impacts if they should indeed occur. Please recognize that if an outbreak of COVID-19 virus does occur in this region, the research enterprise at UC Merced may be affected.
Consistent with the continuity of educational operations, continuity of research at UC Merced is anchored in the following principles:
· personal safety for the entire campus community; and
· ensuring ongoing technical and administrative support of research operations when possible.
This will require us to be flexible with campus-based research protocol and proposal submittal deadlines. I’d like to discuss several areas of operation that could impact the research community:
1. The preparation, review and submittal of proposals can happen entirely electronically, so as long as the Departmental Research Administrators and ORED staff are not severely impacted with the virus, these activities should occur on time and without interruption.
If a number of staff are personally impacted, we will suspend all internal submittal deadlines. Under these conditions, it will not be possible to completely review all proposals prior to submittal, but they will be submitted as long as the sponsors are still accepting applications. (All federal agencies have a provision for late submittals of proposals in the event of natural disasters, including pandemics. ORED will work with extramural sponsors to address delays in research productivity resulting from and impact associated with the COVID-19 virus at UC Merced.)
The selection process for limited submission proposals will expedited if needed to ensure that proposals from UC Merced can meet the submittal deadlines posed by extramural sponsors.
2. The operation of core facilities managed by ORED will continue unless general campus operations are suspended. In the event that a particular core facility cannot accommodate your needs due to closure or the illness of the technical support staff, we will assist you in finding access to facilities at another campus if they remain open.
3. The Division of Animal Research Services (DARS, the vivarium) operates continuously, 365 days per year. DARS has a formal emergency management plan that directly addresses the topic of human disease outbreaks and pandemics. I encourage animal users to discuss this topic directly with the Campus Attending Veterinarian, Kate Clark and/or the Director of DARS, Roy Hoglund.
4. Natural Reserve System (NRS) facilities will remain open and available for use as long as general campus operations continue, however operation of the Yosemite and Sequoia Field Stations will be contingent upon the status of and access to Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks. If general campus operations are suspended, essential research-related activities may proceed at NRS facilities, as long as NRS staff are not severely impacted with the virus. Please consult with Faculty Director Jessica Blois on any questions related to your specific upcoming reserve use.
5. The Office of Research Compliance and Integrity will continue to function across its areas. If necessary, meetings of the IRB and IACUC committees can occur through video conferencing.
To reiterate: Should COVID-19 impact the Merced region, the UC Merced research enterprise may be affected. Research personnel transactions, research procurements and travel are all handled by units external to ORED. The ongoing operations of activities in these areas will likely be contingent upon the availability of staff. Please consult with your school and ORU offices to address questions in these areas. Principle investigators are encouraged to review their own research continuity plans to determine how best to handle a possible interruption of activities.

10-Mar-20,374,"UPDATE: Moving Toward Remote Learning
March 10, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
 
With the health and safety of our community as our highest priority during global concerns about COVID-19 (coronavirus), UC Merced leadership, following University of California guidance, will begin moving toward remote learning.
 
The campus is not closing, and classes are not being canceled. Instructors are encouraged to begin using digital tools like CatCourses and Zoom to offer courses remotely, when feasible.
 
Resources are available for instructors who do not have extensive experience delivering course material remotely. The Office of Information Technology has established a website to guide instructors in the appropriate use of these technologies; the provost’s office will facilitate peer training by instructors with more experience teaching remotely; and the Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning will be available for consultation as well. Given that we do not have extensive central support for making this transition, we will initially prioritize live support for instructors of the largest classes. Please be patient in asking for help and recognize that any way of delivering lectures—even by voice recording alone—is better than complete disruption of instruction.
 
The purpose of this shift to remote learning is to reduce interpersonal contact. This is a form of “social distancing” designed to help lessen the spread of the virus should it become present on our campus. Labs, performance-based courses, and those involving field work do not need to be modified at this time, though steps towards reducing the number and length of in-person meetings are still encouraged when appropriate. Instructors will manage their own courses and communicate to students as needed.
 
While we know that the average-aged college student is not at high risk for serious COVID-19 illness , even those who are very mildly ill carry the virus and potentially put others at risk. We encourage everyone in our community to take normal precautions and be considerate of others, on and off campus, particularly those in higher risk categories.
 
Campus leadership will continue to monitor developments and inform the campus community about any changes to the schedule or course delivery methodology. As always, please visit our website for the most current and credible information on COVID-19.

We have decided to implement these procedures prior to learning of any cases in Merced County. That is to say, we are putting the safety of students, faculty, and staff first, and are doing our part to help control the spread of the disease proactively.
 
While we are moving course instruction online, the residence halls and the Pavilion will remain open. We have modified service in the Pavilion, to eliminate self-service, increase opportunities for to-go meals, and arrange for proxy meal pick up for students who are ill. The campus has increased cleaning, particularly of commonly used surfaces and in high traffic areas, such as the Pavilion and the Gallo Recreation and Wellness Center. We will be installing more hand sanitation dispensers around campus in an effort to promote healthy preventative behaviors across campus.
 
While we know that the average-aged college student is not at high risk for serious COVID-19 illness , even those who are so mildly ill as to be asymptomatic carry the virus and potentially put others at risk. We encourage everyone in our community to take normal precautions and be considerate of others, on and off campus, particularly those in higher risk categories.
 
Additionally, I know these changes may cause some stress and uncertainty. Please bear with us while we manage this complicated transition.

March 13, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The health and safety of our campus community remain our foremost concern as we all explore ways to maintain campus operations during the nation’s response to COVID-19. We are committed to doing all we can to mitigate the spread of this virus into our community.
In coordination with the University of California and other campuses, UC Merced is issuing guidance on remote working arrangements for employees during this period of heightened concern. The full guidance can be found on the Human Resources page on the Emergency Management website.
Supervisors must determine how best to designate staff for their units’ success.“Designated staff” are those who are not eligible to telecommute; these staff members must perform their jobs on campus to:
Ensure the health and safety of the campus community;
Provide direct customer service that cannot be performed from another location;
Ensure critical continuity of operations on campus that cannot be performed from another location;
Respond timely to an emergency.
Approaches could include flexible work schedules, such as fewer but longer workdays, or alternating staff between on-site and telecommuting work. The guidance document suggests several potential approaches.
In determining a remote working arrangement:
Supervisors must document individual agreements. A form for documenting that agreement can be found on the Human Resources page of the Emergency site.
The documentation must include duration of the arrangement, days and hours, location and contact information.
Employees must abide by all normal workplace rules such as meal breaks, advance approval of overtime and approval of sick, vacation or other leave.
Employees must be able to ensure they are working in a safe environment and can protect university records and equipment.
Supervisors must treat workers equitably.
As always, our spirit of community will go a long way here toward coming to agreeable resolutions that balance the university’s and employees’ needs. Human Resources staff remain available to assist with any discussions or special circumstances.
Remember that all university communications and links to credible sources of information can be found on our COVID-19 website.

March 23, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered Californians to stay at home indefinitely as health care providers and public officials work to minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Educational institutions like UC Merced are subject to this order, but it is important to note that our campus remains operational. Many functions will be performed remotely, including instruction, which is being delivered as our students continue to make progress toward their degrees. For the few students who remain on campus, we will continue to provide essential services.
We understand that each new announcement from university leadership about the coronavirus creates challenges and anxieties. And now our community is called upon to comply with new guidance, the implications of which we are still exploring with state officials. We appreciate your patience as we navigate these unfamiliar waters together.
We have notified you that two students who reported symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results while under self-quarantine, one on campus and one in a private home. We have no new information on either case at this time, but we will share any updates as we receive them.
We also want to call attention to the unparalleled cooperation and coordination of local, state and federal officials. Congressman Jim Costa has kept us updated on the latest federal thinking and plans. We are grateful to Assembly Member Adam Gray, Merced County and City of Merced officials, and the Merced County Department of Public Health in particular for their advice and assistance.
During this time, campus will operate similar to winter break — only a few core services will be operating, and very few students will be in residence.
Below is a summary of operations we have determined to be essential:
Academic instruction (now offered remotely).
Student housing and dining services, which will continue for a small number of students who remain on campus.
Student health services.
Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels.
Approved research activities.
Emergency response, such as police and environmental health and safety.
IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning.
Human resources, finance and the Employee Assistance Program for employees.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for students, via telehealth. Students can contact CAPS 24/7 at (209) 228-4266 for assistance.
This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential services and employees designated to be on campus will be distributed by supervisors.
In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, here is a running list of communications to faculty, students and staff. All of these, as well as FAQs updated daily and critical resources, are available at emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus.
Some important points to remember:
Essential activity, including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence, is permitted by the governor’s order. Travel abroad is prohibited.
Students may remain in housing only if necessary.
Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave or have been asked to work remotely. Employees with questions and concerns can always contact your supervisor, Human Resources, or the University Ombuds Office.
Do not come to campus to conduct research unless specifically approved.
Events, including commencement, have been cancelled or postponed, and meetings should be limited or conducted in a safe manner.
We are proud of the way everyone at UC Merced — students, faculty and staff — has stepped up during our response to this global crisis: with safety and wellness at the fore, with energy and passion, with thoughtfulness and deliberation. Thank you for all you have done and all you do to prove yet again that this university truly is the great institution, and great community, we have always aspired to be.
We want to assure every member of our community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on our COVID-19 information page.
Sincerely,
Nathan Brostrom

16-Mar-20,1670,"March 16, 2020To all Graduate Students and Post-Doctoral Scholars (and copying Graduate Group Chairs and School Deans),I know that this is a time of immense stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. All of us at UC Merced are trying to maximize safety and flexibility.In terms of general guidance on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it, please see https://emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus. I also recommend this article that lays out the science of the need to act quickly: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99caand Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths(behind a paywall).I want to respond to a number of questions that have come to me, so please bear with me as this is a somewhat lengthy note.The situation is very fluid, and responses that I provide today may be outdated in a day or two. I will do my best to keep you informed as we move forward during this emergency. Your Scholarly Activities After spring break, all courses—graduate and undergraduate—will be conducted via remote teaching methods for the remainder of the Spring Semester. The faculty remain in full control of the curriculum and are encouraged to redesign their teaching methods as appropriate given the emergency nature of these changes. We are aware of the particular impact junior scholars face from disruptions to their fieldwork, potentially failed experiments, delays in completion of deadlines now that they are caring for children at home, navigating a distance-based world, and so on. For now, we have asked faculty to think carefully about what work can be done while engaging in appropriate social distancing. We also know that research productivity is being interrupted due to the COVID 19 emergency, and that this may delay your progress towards academic goals, including time to degree. Please be assured that your faculty and the Graduate Division will take these unusual circumstances into consideration in reviewing your progress.Major graduate exams (e.g., advancements, qualifying exams, thesis/dissertation defenses) may all be held virtually. The Graduate Division and Office of Information Technology are working together to make this as simple as possible for you. The forms required for these exams may all be signed and delivered digitally(wet signatures will not be required). For those of you working with human subjects or animal subjects, please be sure to read the following notices, which provide the most current guidance:COVID-19 Humans Subjects Research GuidanceCOVID-19 Animal Subjects Research GuidanceWhatever type of research you conduct, please document changes in protocols so you can write up your methods sections of papers appropriately. Depending on the changes, you may also need to have your modified protocols approved by appropriate review board (see guidance above).Your EmploymentYour employment in Spring will NOT be reduced in response to COVID-19 planning. GSRs:GSRs are asked to work with their PIs to ensure maximum social distancing is taking place, given the work you do. Please try to work from home when you can, spread out in labs, and minimize close contact with others. Start with making contingency plans for research continuity with your PI. If that doesn’t work out or you do not feel comfortable having those conversations, please reach out to your Graduate Group Chair, graduate support staff in the schools, or Maria Nishanian (mnishanian@ucmerced.edu-academic counselor in the Graduate Division) to help you. The faculty have received additional guidance from the Office of Research. Should there be disruptions to operations, the University may have limited ability to assist with research continuity issues. For example, the availability of supplies may lag during the resolution of a health crisis.While the campus plans to provide researchers with access to their space until such a time as it is deemed to be unsafe or is prohibited by state or federal directives, researchers should be prepared for a partial or total cessation of all laboratory-based research. As outlined in a directive from the UC Office of the President,in no event should researchers take reagents, chemicals, biologics or any other laboratory equipment or materials other than laptops, data storage devices,etc., offsite (e.g.,to their homes) during a curtailment. Should there be a closure, it is expected that you will continue to work with your PI on research projects—writing up literature reviews, planning for next grants, etc. TAs:As you know, teaching assistants are under contract to work a set number of hours, depending on the percentage of appointment. After Spring Break, ALLinstructional activity will be delivered remotely. This includes all types of instructional formats –seminars, laboratories, etc. –and all forms of assessments –exams, tests, quizzes, performances, etc.Many faculty simply do not know how much time particular tasks may take or how much undergraduates may be reaching out to you. Please keep your instructor of record informed of your work schedule in the event that they need to step in and do additional work themselves, or request additional resources from their department. The Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning has a number of resources available to you on their website. We encourage use of Zoom and CatCourses, and remind you not to use tools that require payment by students,collect personal information (including biometrics) from students,or put any student information (e.g., grades or test scores) on non-UC Merced systems. Please do not use YouTube to deliver instruction, as UCOP has specifically disallowed it for UC educational purposes.You may also consult the Educational Continuity site for Faculty and Instructors and the Educational Continuity site for students for additional resources. TA’s are encouraged to schedule consultationson using various technologies for remote instruction.International Research and TravelInternational graduate students needing to travel for any reason should be in touch with the International Affairs Office. As of March 12, 2020, the university has curtailed all non-essential domestic or international travel until further notice, and most domestic and international conferences are cancelled. Contact your sponsor regarding refunds for cancellations. If you must travel, please register all University related business travel with UC Away, which allows the University to provide aid to you if something were to happen to you or within your destination country, regardless of nature, and the UC will work to get you back to the U.S. at no cost to you. If travel reservations were made using the University Connexxus Travel program, trip registration in UC Away is automatic. Research in foreign locations should be paused due to current travel restrictions. All proposed travel to high-risk countries, including those with a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Warning Level 3 (widespread community transmission) or Level 2 (sustained community transmfission),must have prior approval from Risk Servicesand the Provost’s office before making travel arrangements. Please consult UC President Napolitano’s most recent travel directive for more information.Your WellbeingThis is a difficult, stressful time. Please remember to be kind to others, and to yourself, and to remember our Principles of Community. Globally, stress, anxiety, and worry are high. Now, more than ever, is the time to care for one another and to remember the inclusive and supportive culture we have all worked so hard to build for so long together. Please remember that UC Merced has no tolerance for bullying or discrimination. In an emergency, call 911. If not an emergency, contact the UC Merced Health Center and Counseling and Psychological Services if you need them. The Advice Nurse may be reached at 209-228-4192, 9 a.m. -4:30p.m. Monday-Friday, excluding holidays or campus closure dates. If your call goes to voicemail, leave a message and the advice nurse will get back to you promptly. You can also use our secured messaging system for non-emergent matters throughmyHealth. To speak to an advice nurse after clinic hours contact 209-228-2273 and follow the prompts to speak to an after-hours nurse. Students covered by UC SHIP can call the 24/7 nurse line 24-hours a day, seven days a week and speak confidentially to a registered nurse. These nurses are trained to help you make more informed decisions about your health situation. This number is also on the back of your member ID card. We encourage you to take a break during Spring Break and get some rest. We strongly encourage you NOT to do any non-essential travel during the break. Should you choose to leave Merced,please be prepared not to return, given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. Let me also pass on the following recommendations from my colleague at UC Irvine: •Have zoom dates with friends. This can be a good time to totally decompress or to chat with people about your research. You can even have remote writing hangouts, and we will host some of these through the GPSRC.•Get outside! Although we do not recommend touching playgrounds, park benches, and so on without a good scrub, going outside for a walk, run, or just to sit in the open air for a few minutes can make a big difference. Please look out for and help your friends with chronic illnesses and/or disabilities. Just getting out might not be as simple for everyone. •Create structure for yourself so you can feel productive and engaged in your work while at home. Divide your work into tasks that take at most 90 minutes, rather than a full day labeled “write dissertation.”•Brainstorm best practices with your friends and share them online through Google docs, Slack, or whatever else you want to try.•For those of you caring for kids, parents, or partners during this time, don’t be alone, even if you are physically isolated. Have a virtual date via video call.Check in with an online support group. On behalf of all of us in the Graduate Division, please do all you can to stay healthy and safe and to keep your loved ones safe. In turn, we will do all we can to minimize disruptions so you can continue with all your successes!My best to all,Marjorie S.

16-Mar-20,367,"At Our Best: Embodying the Principles of Community
March 16, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Over the past few weeks with the evolving COVID-19 situation, our community has faced something many of us have never experienced before. We appreciate the efforts of those on the front lines, both on our campus and around the world.
During these uncertain times, we are all being asked to do more, take on more and be there for each other more. I have witnessed the care and connection that happens when we show up for each other, and it is that deep sense of community that runs throughout and keeps us going.
UC Merced’s power lies in our commitment to a culture that is founded on unity and respect and a community that affirms the inherent dignity and value of every person. This is embodied in our Principles of Community and enacted in our lives and our work every day.
In global health emergencies, fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, which has no room in our community and no part in uncovering the solutions to our challenges. While the CDC has provided much guidance, they have also included resources to reducing stigma , which can also be found on our Emergency Preparedness page.
We actively denounce and discourage xenophobia, bigotry and racism and actively reinforce treating all in our community with respect. If you are being harassed or discriminated against, or if you are a bystander who has witnessed such a situation, please report the incident here .
Amidst all the cancellations and postponements, I wanted to continue to hold a space for you to feel connected. So I will be holding my monthly drop-in hours via Zoom — you can RSVP here and come as you are. This is a space for informal dialogue about anything you would like to discuss. My office is deeply thinking about how we can continue to build belonging through this landscape, so please stay tuned.
We are at our best when we are there for each other and prioritizing community and humanity beyond our routines. I truly believe in our best.

16-Mar-20,665,"COVID-19: Academics Moving to Remote Instruction
March 16, 2020
Dear Colleagues:
 
Thank you for your energetic and collaborative responses to the COVID-19 crisis. We have heard stories of the creativity manifested by departments and programs in working together to maintain instructional continuity. Clearly, you have both a sense of urgency to be responsive to the crisis and a sense of the importance of providing the best education possible in the circumstance.
 
That said, the situation has evolved so quickly that we now must move from encouraging you to requiring you to move to distance delivery of curriculum. We are now going to resume ALL instructional activity after spring break through distance delivery.
 
On Monday March 30, students will engage in all coursework remotely. This includes all types of instructional formats – seminars, laboratories, etc. – and all forms of assessments – exams, tests, quizzes, performances, etc.
 
Additionally, given how many counties are now imposing travel restrictions, some students who went home for the weekend will not be able to return to campus this week. Therefore, we will NOT make this week’s sessions for any in-person classes mandatory. That includes lab, studio, and small classes.
 
We will maintain distance learning through the rest of the spring semester.
 
The Academic Senate is in the process of amending its Emergency Course Continuity Policy to allow for this.
 
We are urging this step to support “social distancing” as well as to provide students with the certainty they need to make decisions about where to reside for spring break and the post-spring break period.
 
Both the Office of Information Technologies (OIT) and the Center for Engaged Teaching and Learning have done excellent work to develop tools to help you move your courses. That said, our ability to support in person every instructor to make this transition is beyond our ability. As such,
 
Do-it-yourself resources continue to be available on the campus’ Educational Continuity website for instructors ;
Instructors, including teaching assistants, may sign up for workshops and individual consultations via the “Schedule a Consultation with the Academic and Emerging Technologies Team” tab under “Finding Help”;
Department chairs and/or deans can direct you to faculty members with online instructional experience who are willing to assist; and
We are in the process of developing ways to manage exams.
 
Zoom
 
For those of you awaiting an individual Zoom account, accounts will be provisioned individually. UC Merced has also obtained an enterprise license that will allow faculty, students and staff to log into a Zoom account via Single SignOn using their UC Merced NetID. The OIT will be working to get that set up throughout this week and announce when it is available. Zoom allows up to 300 participants.
 
Students
 
If you have not already, please communicate to your students your plan for moving the course to remote delivery. Students will need support as they engage in technologies and learning modalities that may be new to them. Toward this end, an Educational Continuity for Students website has been established. We encourage you to review it and direct your students to it, as relevant. As you implement learning at a distance, regular contact with your students will help them succeed in the absence of a normal academic structure.
 
Flexible Approaches to Remote Instruction
 
We also continue to urge:
Use of campus supported technologies like Zoom and CatCourses; and
Asynchronous instructional strategies or low band-width synchronous approaches (e.g. Zoom audio only) to address anticipated demand for Zoom and CatCourses.
 
Planning for Illness
 
Should you become ill and unable to teach your courses, let your department or program chair know immediately. Departments will be responsible to maintain instructional continuity in such cases.
 
In closing, we thank you for your patience with this quickly evolving and fluid situation. Please take appropriate measures to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and healthy--physically and mentally.
 
Please be kind to yourself, your colleagues and staff.
 
Thank you,

March 16, 2020
Faculty,
Over the coming days and weeks there is a potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to affect research on the UC Merced campus. Some areas that may be affected are disruptions to the supply chain with limited campus delivery and a slowdown of the production of reagents and consumables internationally. Travel for academic conferences, workshops and field activities have been and will continue to be impacted. With these considerations, we have identified a series of issues for your consideration and recommendations for preparedness in research laboratories. As this is a fluid situation, we have built a Research Continuity page on the Emergency Preparedness website where these recommendations will be continually updated as quickly as possible as new information is available.
While this guidance attempts to address a variety of circumstances, all faculty and researchers should discuss contingency plans with their Deans and Department Chairs, as well as with students and staff under their supervision to ensure research continuity. Should there be disruptions to operations, the University may have limited ability to assist with research continuity issues.
Researchers should be prepared for a partial or total cessation of all laboratory based research. Please review the guidance below on Laboratory preparations.
It is our intent to provide researchers with access to their space until such a time as it is deemed to be unsafe or is prohibited by state or federal directives. As outlined in a directive from the UC Office of the President, in no event should researchers take reagents, chemicals, biologics or any other laboratory equipment or materials other than laptops, data storage devices, etc., offsite (e.g., to their homes) to ensure research continuity during a curtailment.
All faculty should familiarize themselves with these guidelines. Below is a bulleted list of potential circumstances covered on the Research Continuity page.

17-Mar-20,728,"COVID-19: Spring Break Guidance for Students
March 17, 2020
Dear Students,
 
Today we have informed faculty that all instructional activity until the end of the semester is to be offered remotely and to transition all our courses to some form of available instruction. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority.
 
As was shared in earlier communication, we are committed to ensuring students have every opportunity to fulfill their academic commitments and continue to progress toward their degrees and their careers. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to all students in non-lecture courses and settings; that will be complete by the start of spring break. Students should reach out to their faculty members if they have questions about how courses will be delivered.
 
Any students who went home over the weekend to the California counties that have imposed travel restrictions, and are now under a shelter-in-place order, are exempt from attendance requirements for in-person classes this week. This includes lab, studio and small classes.
 
We have also developed a resource page for you, as students, on tips and pointers to best engage in this learning environment.
 
Information for Students Who Stay on Campus
 
My earlier email confirmed that our residence halls and a dining facility will stay open, including during spring break. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break, and we are increasing sanitization efforts in common areas and strengthening our broadband to support online learning to help ensure a safe and healthy environment for students living on campus.
 
It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing both in the residence halls and the dining facilities. Please rest assured, we will support you in your decision about where it is best for you to reside during this public health emergency.
 
Information for Students Who Move Out
 
If you live on campus in one of our residence halls, you will receive relief from your campus housing and dining fees if you decide to move out. The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts for students who decide to move out of campus housing for the remainder of this academic year. The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid, based upon the effective move-out date.
 
Students who want to move out must complete a written request. The campus will process two move-out dates, March 20 and March 30, depending on when you formally check out of your residence hall. The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student’s housing costs are covered by financial aid or remaining balances on an account.
 
Here is the portal for reporting your intention: https://ucmerced.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalx/

Information for Student Employees
 
We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs, yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. New guidance regarding all staff employees was issued today by the UC Office of the President, and UC Merced Human Resources will soon be distributing guidance for our campus, including student employees.
 
Help Us ‘Flatten the Curve’
 
Currently there are no reported positive cases of COVID-19 in Merced County, nor any related to members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated Emergency Operations team, and Student Health Services staff, and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely and will keep you updated.

Dear UC Merced Parents and Families,
 
As you know, news about the global COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly, and at UC Merced we are attempting to keep our community informed not only about campus preparations and directives but also about University of California policies and guidance from government agencies. Going forward, we ask you to check our Emergency Management site for the latest information, as well as archives of campus communications and other resources.
 
A reminder: Campus is open and campus offices remain operational. Classes are not canceled, but faculty are moving to fully remote delivery of courses by the end of spring break — options include online classes, video lectures and the like. Faculty and students should be communicating regularly as we make this transition, to ensure education continues as effectively as possible.
 
We have also posted brief videos, in English and Spanish , specifically for parents, as well as a special message from Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Charles Nies.
 
On March 16, an undergraduate student reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but the student has not tested positive. We notified the campus community and the student has self-quarantined.
 
In the past week, we have sent several messages to our campus, including:
 
Educational continuity: Faculty have been instructed to offer remote learning tools for all courses. All classes will be offered via remote delivery by the end of spring break.
 
Staff telecommuting: Campus offices must maintain operations, but supervisors in many units have flexibility in how to do so, in discussion with employees. Additional guidance on this will be going out about this today.
 
Events and meetings: Large events (over 100) are canceled. We are tracking all campus events with daily updates.
 
Our Principles of Community: The value of our community spirit.
 
We have also communicated with the wider community in many other ways — you may find some of this information instructive or useful as well:
 
Campus leadership Q&A This event was livestreamed on March 11 from campus.

Los Angeles Times story on UC campuses mobilizing.
KVPR (Valley Public Radio) discussion panel on preparations.
 
Merced County Times story on Merced-area institutions’ plans.
 
We will support students in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break, and we will maintain all student support operations. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to increase social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.).
 
If you have specific questions, you can ask through the button at the top of our home page; questions are monitored daily and answered as quickly as possible.

17-Mar-20,766,"COVID-19: Employee Guidance
March 17, 2020
Dear Employees,
 
On March 16, President Napolitano released an Executive Order that critical steps must be taken to limit the exposure of members of our community to the disease within our community, to care for those who have fallen ill or otherwise been exposed, and to assure the continued functioning of critical operations.
 
Effective immediately, all “non-designated” UC Merced employees will work remotely 100% of the time.
 
Division heads should designate employee groups who are not eligible, or have limited ability to telecommute, and create plans to reduce the on-site density of employees as much as possible.
 
“Designated employees” are those who are not eligible for, or have limited ability to, telecommute. These employees must perform their jobs on campus to:
Ensure the health and safety of the campus community.
Provide direct customer service that cannot be performed from another location.
Ensure critical continuity of operations on campus that cannot be performed from another location.
Respond timely to an emergency.
 
Temporary Telecommute Agreements should be executed for eligible employees to achieve this goal. This Agreement should be used in all instances where management has determined that work may temporarily be performed from home or at an alternate location during this crisis.
There is no set duration for these agreements, but they should be reviewed at least every 30 days.
 
In situations where designated employees can work temporarily from home or from an alternate location, we ask that managers work to identify these opportunities, implement them as soon as possible, and document them in a Temporary Telecommute Agreement.
 
For all non-designated employees, we ask that supervisors execute Temporary Telecommute Agreements that reflect 100% remote work as soon as possible.
 
Managers and supervisors should determine
The positions and tasks where work can be performed remotely.
The appropriate level of work for telecommuters and how work will be assigned and how performance is measured.
The working days, hours, and times of work on telecommuting days.
Availability and methods of communication for employees who are telecommuting.
 
For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented and student workers), managers and employees should develop a work plan for those special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training that could be completed remotely.
 
Departments may enter into telecommuting arrangements with the approval of the department head and in consultation with the respective dean or vice chancellor, who is responsible for documenting the division’s workflow and ensuring Temporary Telecommute Agreements are in place.
 
Paid Administrative Leave
 
All employees are eligible for a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject to these conditions:
All hours must be used by Dec. 31, 2020.
he hours may be used intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, as long as this doesn’t adversely affect the delivery of essential university services.
The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time will be prorated according to the percent of the appointment.
Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for this one-time allotment of the paid administrative leave.
 
The paid administrative leave may be used only:
When an employee is unable to work due to the employee’s own COVID-19-related illness or that of a family member;
When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the worksite has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program, or is under a shelter in place order and it is not feasible for the employee to work remotely;
When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
 
We encourage managers and supervisors read the full guidance on remote working arrangements and determine who must be designated to remain.
 
Even for designated employees, the university recommends meetings be held using Zoom or another tool that provides for social distancing. Following recent federal guidance, we strong discourage in-person gatherings of more than 10 people.
 
Remember to visit UC Merced’s COVID-19 Emergency Management site for updates, all university communications and credible sources of health and safety information. Please continue to practice hand washing and social distancing, and take care of yourself and one another.

March 18, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
In an effort to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our UC Merced community as we navigate COVID-19 together, I would like to share with you detailed information and guidance to help inform your actions in response to the coronavirus and mitigate its potential impacts on your professional and personal lives.
 
Working from Home
 
Leaders across campus have transitioned staff to full-time telecommute, retaining only limited on-site operations for critical functions. In most cases, telecommuting applies to administrative staff that are “non-designated.” Each leader is working with her/his respective managers and supervisors to communicate a workplan for the unit. The telecommuting initiative will stay in effect for approximately 30 days and will be re-evaluated as needed.
 
During this period, staff working from home are expected to be fully available for meetings and responsive to requests during normal business hours. There are many useful tools and resources to help employees stay connected, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business, among others. Check with your supervisor to see what your unit is utilizing.
 
Additional telecommuting resources can be found here .
 
Working Onsite
 
While many staff will be working from home, there are critical operations on campus that cannot be completed remotely. For those employees who are designated to be on campus, we thank you for being on the front lines and continuing to come to work during these unprecedented circumstances. Please be sure to safeguard your own health and that of others by taking personal precautions and practicing social distancing.
 
COVID-19 Administrative Leave
 
In accordance with President Napolitano’s Executive Order , effective March 1 through Dec. 31, 2020, employees will be eligible to receive up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave in order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
These hours can only be used with prior approval from your supervisor and are designed to assist you if, for example: you or a family member becomes ill with COVID-19; you cannot come to work because of a COVID-19 related school or daycare closure; or you have been directed not to come into work for COVID-19 related reasons but you and your supervisor determine that it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely.
 
These hours are only for employees who are unable to work, either on campus or remotely, because of hardships related to COVID-19. Please be mindful that many staff are urgently needed at this time to maintain the critical operations of the university, and that the use of these special administrative leave hours requires supervisor approval.
 
Recording and Coding of Administrative Leave
 
Paid administrative leave is intended to cover an employees regularly scheduled hours of work when an employee is impacted by their own COVID-19 related illness or meets other leave criteria outlined above. Employees who are less than 100% time will have their available hours prorated based on their regular work schedule.
 
Hourly paid employees who are working — either remotely or in the office — will continue to report their actual hours worked in the Time Reporting System (TRS). If you and your supervisor have determined use of the paid administrative leave is applicable, please use the provided code of 'Paid Leave (COVID19)' to report all hours subject to the leave.

March 18, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The COVID-19 pandemic is requiring constant adjustment and change for everyone. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as our operations continue to adjust in response to current recommendations and requirements.
Effective immediately, each principal investigator (PI) or research group leader of a laboratory research program (experimental, computational or otherwise) should prepare a strategy to ramp down campus laboratory research activities, with the expectation that if a closure occurs, suspended lab access will likely last at least six to eight weeks.
If a campus closure is ordered by government officials, the default assumption is that all research activities will cease by a time designated in the closure order, unless that research is deemed essential and those individuals conducting that research are designated as essential research personnel. All PIs will have the opportunity to request that their research activities be designated as essential.
Please review this detailed memo for information on research operations, essential classification and how to proceed. A checklist is also available to help you prepare for a potential campus closure.

Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced’s Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is making several changes to campus parking and bus transit, to be responsive to rapidly changing conditions and out of concern for our community’s health and well-being.
 
CatTracks will continue to operate regular service through Friday, March 20. Spring break routes for March 21-27 are available on the TAPS website. TAPS will continually assess CatTracks and Route UC services, and will update you if circumstances change.
 
TAPS has also made several changes to parking payments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
 
Faculty, staff and graduate students on a payroll deduction plan who will not come to campus during the pandemic can go to the TAPS website and complete the “Payroll Cancellation” form. Once completed, the cancellation form should be emailed to TAPS to deactivate parking permissions and corresponding payroll deductions.
 
Graduate students who have prepaid with cash, check or charge should email TAPS and elect to cancel their current parking permit. The refunded amount will be the prorated balance from the date of the request.
 
Faculty, staff and graduate students who elect to reinstate existing parking permissions prior to July 1 should contact TAPS to reactivate parking and reinstate payroll deductions.
 
Until further notice, TAPS will suspend permit requirements for undergraduate/commuter students.
 
Current, valid permits of students who prepaid will be canceled. The monthly rate for undergraduate parking for AY 2019-20 is equivalent to $33 per month, and students will be refunded $50 for April 1 through May 15 (minus any outstanding parking citations posted to a student’s record). Refunds will be made directly to the student’s account/bill. Please do not visit the TAPS office to process parking refunds.
 
Please contact TAPS at taps@ucmerced.edu or 209-228-8277 with questions regarding transportation and parking services.

20-Mar-20,723,"To all Graduate Students, Graduate Group Chairs, Faculty,As long as in-person student and faculty meetings are suspended on campus, qualifying exam committees and thesis defense committees are encouraged to work with candidates to arrange for oral portions of exams and defenses to be conducted remotely and synchronously if at all possible, and to consider asynchronous alternatives if necessary. Arrangements should be made with the understanding that real-time presentations and synchronous discussions are difficult to conduct remotely, and this difficulty may affect the examination process. Students and faculty should take measures to minimize the potentially detrimental effect of remote interactions. The Graduate Division offers the following suggestions to help:•For examinations as well as regular committee meetings, students and faculty should use Zoom or other social media platforms like Skype and Microsoft Teams, depending on individual preferences. The campus has now acquired a site license for Zoom Pro and all faculty, staff and students will be proactively provisioned in the next few days. Watch your email for a confirmation from Zoom.•Zoom has several functions that may be useful during examination, including screen sharing, chat messaging, virtual whiteboarding, and virtual hand raising. OIT/CETL offers 1-1 consultation on Digital Tools for Thesis Defense which includes using Zoom. Use this link to sign up. •It may be helpful for the candidate and committee to do a test Zoom session beforehand to ensure that all the desired functions are working, and everyone knows how to use them. OIT also offers group Workshops on Using Zoom. Use this link to sign up. •Committee members should ensure that functions are working while the candidate is presenting, and all members should be prepared to pause the candidate if they notice a malfunction (the chat and virtual hand functions may still work if the audio and video signals are not working).•If only audio conferencing will be used, the candidate should distribute slides and any other visual materials beforehand, in an agreed-upon format.•Committee members should have an agreed-upon protocol for managing questions during and after presentations. It may be helpful for the Chair to coordinate questions explicitly rather than “open the floor” toquestions.•After the presentation and questions are done, the candidate can leave the Zoom session while the committee deliberates and then invited back by e.g. email when deliberations are done.•Thesis defenses may be announced to the community electronically as usual. It is common that a portion of thesis defenses are open to the campus community. The student and committee mayMarch 20, 2020
consider sharing a recording of the public portion, and/or others may be invited to join the public portion of the Zoom session. Invitees should disable their video to conserve bandwidth.•If presenting via Zoom or a similar platform is prohibitively difficult, committee members may consider whether it would be acceptable for the candidate to make a pre-recorded presentation available via Box, YouTube, or a similar platform. Then synchronous interactions could focus on questioning and be done by Zoom, possibly with audio only, or a platform for instant messaging if bandwidth is not enough for audio. OIT offers online workshops for creating videos. Use this link to sign up.•Forms for reporting examination outcomes may be signed electronically. Multiple signatures may be gathered on one form, or if easier, the form may be filled in and then copied to each committee member for them to sign separately. Then the separate forms may be gathered and merged into a single PDF. Forms and other information may be found here:https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/current-students/academic-informationFinally, students and committees should make every effort to conduct examinations remotely rather than postpone them. If a qualifying exam or thesis defense must be postponed, the delay should not factor into assessment of the examination or the student’s progress towards degree. The Graduate Division will make every effort to process forms for advancements and degree clearances in time for the standard deadlines that still apply (see https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/current-students/calendar-and-deadlines).

20-Mar-20,685,"COVID-19: Shutdown of All On-Campus Research
March 20, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
Yesterday, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CA Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay at home order for all residents. Through consultation with Deans, faculty, and leaders across campus, we have determined that:
 
All Principal Investigators shall work with their local administrators to begin a campus-wide UC Merced Research Facilities Shutdown. Research must be drawn down as soon and as safely as possible, and a plan enacted for on-campus research to cease by noon Sunday, March 22, 2020 until further notice. People conducting this shutdown effort for each group should be kept at an absolute minimum between now and noon on Sunday.
 
Under no conditions is laboratory equipment, chemicals, biologics, materisals, etc., be taken off-campus. Laptops and other mobile storage devices can be taken off-campus. All human subjects research requiring face-to-face, in person interaction shall cease immediately.
 
Please use the UC Merced Ramp Down Checklist to assist in your shutdown planning.
 
Expect the shutdown to last several weeks to months. Only remote research, defined as that which can be done remotely and does not require laboratory equipment and supplies, should be performed in this period without further permission.
 
If a Principal Investigator requires ongoing research to take place at a campus site during a shutdown, they will be required to fill out an Essential Research Request form in the InfoReady system. Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments must be submitted via the request form linked below. These requests will be reviewed by the relevant Deans together with the Vice Chancellor for Research and faculty representatives. Expect very few exceptions to be granted. Please note that this permission is only required for those activities which must be conducted on campus (the campus proper or other UC Merced facilities).
 
Essential Research Request Form
 
Details on Essential Research: Essential research functions are any functions that are necessary to maintain baseline research or scholarly operations and projects (e.g. vivarium management, clean room management, etc.), that if not continued will result in irreparable damage to instruments, samples or research programs. Any disruption to an “essential research function” could jeopardize the completion of sponsored projects (even if delayed), the reputation of faculty and the institution with sponsors, the prospects of future funding, and even the research capability itself housed at the institution.
 
We note that there are other important creative research programs on campus (music, dance, practice rooms, etc.) that will also need to be stopped on campus.
 
Note that students and trainees (including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) are not mandated to serve as essential personnel. The decision to report to campus lies with the student worker. Consenting to serve in this capacity will require the signature of the graduate student or postdoc as well as the signature of a third-party individual (a School Dean or their designee). Please use our Essential Research
Trainee Certification form as a template.
 
No personnel should “rush” to campus or campus locations prior to March 22 to complete work. All efforts in the next days should be focused on shutting on-campus research down and transition to off-site research where possible.
 
Mitigating Impact On Our Researchers: The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior researchers. While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship. The Office of Research is working remote but fully operational and continuously updating its COVID19 website with agency guidance regarding research funding.
 
This is a difficult time for all of us and we do not take the cessation of research on campus lightly. Your sacrifices will help save lives. This is one of the most challenging times in modern history. Together, we can make a difference. We know the facts. We have a responsibility to take the lead.

20-Mar-20,705,"COVID-19: Research Computing Continuity
March 20, 2020
Dear Faculty,
 
We are writing to update the campus community on the status of research computing operations and services at UC Merced with regard to Vice Chancellor Samuel Traina’s recent announcement that all on-campus research will cease by noon on Sunday, March 22. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as our operations continue to adjust in response to on-going recommendations and requirements. We are hopeful that some degree of cyberinfrastructure can be maintained and supported to provide research computing capacity for campus researchers.
 
To this end, the Cyberinfrastructure & Research Technologies (CIRT) office has established a set of continuity plans for the research computing enterprise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our campus community. Consistent with other campus continuity plans, continuity of CIRT at UC Merced is anchored in the following two principles: (1) personal safety for the entire campus community; and (2) ensuring ongoing technical support of research operations to the extent possible.
 
CIRT status updates will be posted online and on the MERCED Cluster GitHub user wiki.
 
Below, we list CIRT assets/services with current and anticipated levels of availability during the time campus is impacted by COVID-19. As always, we encourage use of the Service Now system to request CIRT services (including account requests). The CIRT team will endeavor to respond to such requests in a timely manner, though delays may arise due to the current situation.
 
MERCED Cluster
 
The MERCED Cluster was taken offline late last week to undergo maintenance and to be moved to the new Computational Research Facility (Borg Cube), a state-of-the-art data facility built in Project 2020 in support of campus high-performance computing. The cluster move has been somewhat affected by COVID-19 emergency measures, though we remain hopeful that cluster access will be available by Wednesday, March 25. To the extent possible, the CIRT team is committed to keeping the MERCED cluster available for campus researchers to maintain research computing continuity.
 
Maintenance activity on long term storage assets has been impacted by the recent campus operational changes. At present, those resources are unavailable. Access to long term storage servers will be limited for an indefinite time.
 
WAVE Lab
 
The WAVE Lab is closed. WAVE Lab operations will remain suspended until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume.
 
Research Computing In-Person Consultation Is Moving Online
 
The CIRT team has been holding weekly office hours on Fridays as well as providing in-person consultation by appointment. The weekly office hours have been canceled for this week and during spring break. CIRT expects to use a webinar format for weekly drop-in research computing office hours starting Friday, April 3, 2020 through such time as campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume. More information about research computing drop-in office hours will be shared with the campus community the week of March 30 via the Research Computing website and the MERCED Cluster GitHub user wiki.
 
PI and Lab Hardware/Software Deployment Support
 
The CIRT team is committed to continuing some level of support for hardware and software support for individual research groups. However, faculty and other members of the campus research community should anticipate delays in such support. In-person consultations and on-site physical support will be suspended until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume. We also note that many hardware and software vendors are also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in additional service delays and limitations beyond our control.
 
MERCED Node and Other Hardware/Software Purchase Planning
 
The CIRT team is committed to continue some level of support for MERCED node purchasing and purchase planning for grant proposals, start-up budget planning for faculty candidates, and the like. Additionally, CIRT will coordinate with campus procurement to determine feasibility of node and other hardware/software purchases supporting research computing efforts on a case-by-case basis accounting for research project impact, fund source, budget closing dates, and other similar factors. Note that meetings for such planning will be available only by phone and videoconference; CIRT will not provide in-person consultations until campus leadership determines conventional in-person campus operations are safe to resume.

20-Mar-20,689,"COVID-19: Weekly Briefing from the Chancellor
March 23, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered Californians to stay at home indefinitely as health care providers and public officials work to minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Educational institutions like UC Merced are subject to this order, but it is important to note that our campus remains operational. Many functions will be performed remotely, including instruction, which is being delivered as our students continue to make progress toward their degrees. For the few students who remain on campus, we will continue to provide essential services.
We understand that each new announcement from university leadership about the coronavirus creates challenges and anxieties. And now our community is called upon to comply with new guidance, the implications of which we are still exploring with state officials. We appreciate your patience as we navigate these unfamiliar waters together.
We have notified you that two students who reported symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results while under self-quarantine, one on campus and one in a private home. We have no new information on either case at this time, but we will share any updates as we receive them.
We also want to call attention to the unparalleled cooperation and coordination of local, state and federal officials. Congressman Jim Costa has kept us updated on the latest federal thinking and plans. We are grateful to Assembly Member Adam Gray, Merced County and City of Merced officials, and the Merced County Department of Public Health in particular for their advice and assistance.
During this time, campus will operate similar to winter break — only a few core services will be operating, and very few students will be in residence.
Below is a summary of operations we have determined to be essential:
Academic instruction (now offered remotely).
Student housing and dining services, which will continue for a small number of students who remain on campus.
Student health services.
Building systems and custodial services, although at reduced levels.
Approved research activities.
Emergency response, such as police and environmental health and safety.
IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning.
Human resources, finance and the Employee Assistance Program for employees.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for students, via telehealth. Students can contact CAPS 24/7 at (209) 228-4266 for assistance.
This is not an exhaustive list. Further information regarding the status of essential services and employees designated to be on campus will be distributed by supervisors.
In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, here is a running list of communications to faculty, students and staff. All of these, as well as FAQs updated daily and critical resources, are available at emergency.ucmerced.edu/coronavirus.
Some important points to remember:
Essential activity, including traveling to return to your permanent place of residence, is permitted by the governor’s order. Travel abroad is prohibited.
Students may remain in housing only if necessary.
Do not come to work if you are on approved administrative or other approved leave or have been asked to work remotely. Employees with questions and concerns can always contact your supervisor, Human Resources, or the University Ombuds Office.
Do not come to campus to conduct research unless specifically approved.
Events, including commencement, have been cancelled or postponed, and meetings should be limited or conducted in a safe manner.
We are proud of the way everyone at UC Merced — students, faculty and staff — has stepped up during our response to this global crisis: with safety and wellness at the fore, with energy and passion, with thoughtfulness and deliberation. Thank you for all you have done and all you do to prove yet again that this university truly is the great institution, and great community, we have always aspired to be.
We want to assure every member of our community that we remain fully committed to all of you and your well-being. Additional updates will be communicated in future messages, and we are posting updates regularly on our COVID-19 information page.

March 23, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
 
As we do our best to work through the COVID-19 crisis, we write to offer guidance on several matters that affect faculty (and other academic appointees). We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through the various areas of concern.
 
Paid Administrative Leave
 
Effective March 1, 2020, President Napolitano issued an executive order that authorized up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave for academic appointees. Paid administrative leave may be granted if at least one of the following conditions are met:
 
unable to work because of your own health issues related to COVID-19 or those of a family member;
unable to work because you have been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID-19-related remote work program or is under a shelter-in-place order and it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely; or
unable to work because a COVID-19 related school or daycare closure demands that you to be home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for you to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.
 
All academic appointees — policy-covered and represented (including students) — are eligible for COVID-19 related leave if one of these criteria apply. Please note, however, that paid administrative leave must not adversely affect the delivery of instruction or other essential university services. Please see the attachment for general provisions of these guidelines .
 
Academic employees who are requesting paid administrative leave must have prior approval from their supervisor.
 
Completing Timesheets
 
Monthly paid employees will continue to report leave time — sick, vacation, etc. — in the Time Reporting System (TRS) , including applicable use of authorized paid administrative leave. Employees will use the provided code of “Paid Leave (COVID19)” in full-day increments when applicable.
 
Monthly paid (academic) student employees who do not report time via TRS should work with APO ( academicpersonnel@ucmerced.edu ) for information related to COVID-19 impacts.
 
Processing of Merit and Promotion Cases
 
As mentioned in an earlier memo to department chairs, cases for faculty (and other academic employees) in progress with a July 1, 2020, effective date will continue to be processed. Every effort will be made to have all cases decided before the end of June.
 
Recruitments and New Appointments
 
As already noted in a memo to search committee chairs last week, departments should continue to conduct searches for open positions through online means. Appointment cases will continue to be processed.
 
Longer-Term Impacts on Faculty and Other Academic Employees
 
As with all advancement cases, review committees, department chairs, and deans should provide detailed information about the current context and reduced activity in research, challenges in teaching, service contributions, etc., as needed. Faculty should not be penalized for a reduction in work activities during the COVID-19 crisis and are encouraged to write self-statements that mention that work was affected.

March 25, 2020
To: All Faculty
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
Many faculty have asked how the rules governing faculty copyright to their instructional materials apply in these extraordinary circumstances.
 
The basic principle of university policy is that instructional faculty own copyright in their instructional materials, unless the university has made exceptional resource commitments to the development of those materials. Given the nature of this COVID-19 crisis, faculty are wondering if the definition of “exceptional university resources” applies now.
 
Simply, it does not. While we are in exceptional circumstances, all faculty are equally impacted. We are therefore classifying the resources provided to develop your course materials as customary and not exceptional.
 
I hope this alleviates any concerns you might have.

March 26, 2020
March 26, 2020
To: All Administrative Staff
 
Colleagues,
 
As we adjust to the changing work environments and stay at home orders brought on by the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, we want to remind you the performance appraisal process is continuing.
 
In consideration of the changes to our operations, though, we have revised the performance appraisal timeline. The time allowed for employees to complete and submit their Summary of Accomplishments (SOA) has been extended to April 13. Additionally, supervisors’ deadline to submit staff appraisals has been extended to April 30.





Please note that after 15 minutes of inactivity, the Saba system (formerly Halogen) will time out. The system allows revisions to the form, however changes made after the timeout period are NOT saved. Please make sure to save your work regularly.
 
Supervisors
 
Completion dates for each step of the approval process have been revised. Please refer to the 2019-2020 Performance Appraisal Timeline for full details.
 
Beginning March 30, supervisors may access the performance appraisal form in Saba to begin completing the 2019-20 evaluation for their direct reports. Supervisors are expected to submit appraisals to Human Resources by April 30. Please plan accordingly to complete evaluations for your entire team by the deadline, being mindful that remote access and increased system usage (e.g. VPN, Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.) may require more planning, or it may take more time to schedule meetings.
 
To recap this year’s appraisal process:
 
The appraisal period covers April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020.
A narrative is required for appraisals with an overall rating of Met Some Expectations or Met Few Expectations. It is best practice to provide substantive feedback regardless of rating.
An HR review is required for appraisals rated Met Some Expectations or Met Few Expectations. The system will bypass HR steps for those rated Successfully Met Expectations and Far Exceeds Expectations.
HR will review performance appraisals prior to second-level review.
 
For a comprehensive overview of this year’s performance appraisal process, please refer to the 2019-2020 Performance Appraisal process . For a full schedule of online support workshops, go to the University of California Learning Center (UCLC) and register for a session.
 
If you have any questions regarding the appraisal process, please contact hr@ucmerced.edu .

Dear Campus Community,
 
A campus consultant has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus). The person was last on campus March 16.
 
Merced County Department of Public Health officials have now contacted those with whom the person has interacted, urging them to self-quarantine through March 30 and to report any symptoms.
 
We are working closely with Merced County health officials on this matter. If either university or county officials have not contacted you, there is no need for you to take any extraordinary action at this time.
 
Remember to maintain personal hygiene, and keep up to date with guidance from UC Merced, the University of California, the CDC and other credible sources of information at our COVID-19 Emergency Management site .
 
We remain committed to the health and safety of every member of our campus and will continue to provide updates as we have them.

March 27, 2020
March 27, 2020
To: All Campus
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced we stand with the rest of the country as we work to adapt to our current reality — curtailment of travel, empty classrooms and campuses, canceled and postponed events, economic upheaval, personal challenges of remote learning and work, and reimagining of how to deliver the great education for which the University of California is internationally famous.
 
On behalf of my colleagues, I want to express our profound gratitude to the students, the staff, the faculty and the entire UC Merced community for the resilience, the creativity and the commitment to the campus and to each other that has emanated these past few weeks. These are difficult times for all of us, indeed for the entire world, yet I am impressed and grateful for the goodwill and empathy that Bobcats have shown one another.
 
I also want you to know that I share in your concerns and anxieties about the future. Yet I am also extremely grateful and hopeful for our future, because I know our campus has pulled together so purposefully to address this crisis — and our community is strong, proud and resilient.
 
Our faculty are preparing to resume classes using a variety of technologies. Most students have chosen to remain off campus, and we encourage those returning from spring break to consider that they might be safer and more comfortable learning from home through the rest of the semester.
 
For those few whose circumstances force them to remain on campus, please know that we will continue to provide food, cleaning, health and counseling services and full access to the tools you need to succeed in classes.
 
At UC Merced, we are doing all we can to prepare for what has been happening across the country, while also partnering with city and county officials on a plan to shelter first responders in the event of a local outbreak.
 
The two students on our campus who had reported symptoms of illness and self-quarantined last week have both tested negative for COVID-19. That is good news for them, their families and their friends.
 
But we are not shielded from the spread of this virus. We learned today a campus consultant tested positive, and county officials have reached out to all those with whom this person interacted; no one has reported symptoms, but all were asked to self-quarantine. And Merced County has now reported seven positive tests .
 
Parents and students with questions or concerns can always email specific departments , or attend one of Vice Chancellor Charles Nies’ virtual office hours . I will also be scheduling virtual office hours, and will announce details in the coming days.
 
In the past week, we have communicated to campus about:
 
Guidance for academic appointees and staff.
 
A limited number of our facilities remaining open , including some residence halls. Most have been closed to all but designated personnel.
 
Relaxed policy on copyright ownership of instructional materials.
 
Extended deadlines for staff performance appraisals.
 
Some of our faculty have been sharing useful insights in area media during this crisis:
 
Professor Greg Wright on our economic future .
 
Professor Jennifer Howell on coping with social distance.
 
Professor Martin Haggar on maintaining social support systems.
 
The university will be reaching out to faculty, staff and students early next week as the semester starts up again to offer some specific resources to help us all get through to May and beyond.
 
I look forward to seeing you again face to face on our beautiful campus. In the meantime, please put your health and that of your loved ones first, and remember that even when apart, we are always a strong community.

March 29, 2020
To: Faculty, staff, students, parents and families
March 29, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
On Monday morning our students resume their studies after Spring Break, as they have for 15 years at UC Merced. And yet almost everything will be different.
 
Everyone is facing unprecedented challenges in our school, work and personal lives. The strength of cross-disciplinary education that the University of California provides will be even more important as we navigate a world that is changing, in some ways permanently.
 
Innovative production and delivery of food and medical supplies, design of new facilities and creation of the next wave of complex communication systems will require nimble engineers and bold business leaders with a strong understanding of history, psychology and ethics. Medicine of the future will depend on the genetic, biochemical and epidemiological research of today. The political scientists we educate today will help determine how governments learn from this crisis and respond to our next great challenge, and those in the humanities, social sciences and arts will help us understand and process human behavior and the impact it has on future generations.
 
There will be struggles and missteps. It is the first time many of our students and faculty have had to learn and teach in a 100 percent remote environment, the first time some of our staff have ever worked remotely, and the first time our researchers have been challenged to continue their efforts without access to their research facilities. We will need to be patient with one another and with ourselves. But I firmly believe, as the author William Faulkner opined years ago, that humankind will not merely endure, but prevail.
 
At UC Merced, I am proud and grateful to see our campus community pull together, forging ahead with conviction and passion. Our academic community is creating new knowledge and understanding of our world through continued research efforts. Our dedicated on-campus staff continue to provide food and clean spaces for those students who remain in residence, and a solid infrastructure to allow faculty and students to focus on remote teaching and learning. And the grit, resilience and persistence of our students will be more evident in the days and weeks ahead than at any other time before.
 
Remember you can find our communications and resources gathered at our COVID-19 Emergency Management site . If you have the ability and means to do so, please consider donating blood , and aiding our Student Emergency Fund to continue our ability to support student success.
 
And above all, keep yourselves and your families safe.

March 30, 2020
To: All students, faculty and staff
March 30, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has made several updates to its services in response to the latest information regarding COVID-19. The changes are designed to be responsive to the needs and concerns of our campus community:
 
CatTracks and Route UC service levels will be significantly reduced beginning today, Monday, March 30. Heritage Express weekend service, the E1 Line and Route UC will operate abbreviated schedules with a focus on providing riders access to essential services. For detailed schedules, please visit the TAPS website .
 
TAPS will suspend on-campus paid parking policies and payroll deductions effective April 1. Customers will see payroll deductions on their April paychecks for March parking services. Faculty and staff who need to be on campus can park in the designated lots best suited to their business needs.
 
Student parking is allowed in the Bellevue Lot. TAPS parking enforcement will be active and will enforce reserved parking space rules, as well as state laws regarding accessible parking, fire lanes and other regulations.
 
TAPS anticipates resuming enforcement for paid parking when California’s stay at home order is lifted and faculty, staff and students begin returning to campus in larger numbers. Parking permit enforcement may resume as soon as June 1. TAPS will inform the campus community at least 48 hours before enforcement resumes.
 
TAPS is in the process of issuing credits to those students who purchased parking for the spring semester valid through May 15. Parking credits will be issued to student accounts along with housing and dining credits.
 
The TAPS office is closed except for designated employees. Please email TAPS or call 209-228-8277 with questions regarding transportation and parking services.

30-Mar-20,362,"Campus Support for Producing Remote Teaching Material
March 30, 2020
To: All faculty and TAs
March 30, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
Today we move forward with instruction in alternative ways many have not explored or experienced before. There are many challenges in doing so. With this in mind — and consideration that instructional spaces including general assignment classrooms and instructional labs are locked down until we hear classes and events can begin meeting in-person again — a procedure has been developed to enable and assist instructors with producing remote teaching material.
 
Four classrooms in COB2 (110, 130, 140 and 170) and the instructional labs in SE1 and SE2 have been designated for this purpose. These rooms are not for in-person instruction and additional individuals beyond the instructor are limited to only those directly assisting instructors in the production of instructional content.
 
These designated spaces will be available for reserved use from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday effective Monday, March 30.
 
Please note, instructors will first work with IT classroom support staff and work through existing resources to develop remote teaching material. If classroom or instructional lab access for use of the technology for producing remote teaching material is deemed necessary, IT will facilitate reserving space. Please follow the steps here to initiate the process:
 
Instructor contacts registrar@ucmerced.edu at least one work day in advance;
Registrar’s Office will facilitate coordination between the instructor and IT classroom support staff;
IT will guide instructors through existing resources here: https://it.ucmerced.edu/EdContinuity ;
If access to a campus room is still needed, IT will create a Service Now ticket and set up an appointment (not to exceed four hours) to coordinate access to the designated room and assist in setting up the technology with the instructor;
The Registrar’s Office will create a calendar appointment on Astra schedule and will notify campus units including facilities, custodial, police and emergency response about the room usage;
Custodians will be scheduled to clean the room after each use.
 
This current process can and will be adapted with changing needs. Thanks for your cooperation and patience.
 
Best,
Gregg Camfield

31-Mar-20,847,"COVID-19: Resources for Faculty as Instruction Resumes
March 31, 2020
To: All faculty and TAs
March 31, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As classes resume, we write to thank you for all you have done to quickly shift the campus to remote education. We know this transition is taking place while you address the needs of your own families, friends and communities. We are grateful for your efforts and hope that you remain healthy and secure.
 
Your commitment to our students is clearly reflected in the work that many of you have been undertaking to better understand your students’ circumstances as they seek to complete the semester in this new educational context. Here we share some of what has been learned through course-specific polls and surveys, together with some resources we hope will support you and your students going forward.
 
Student Access to Technology
 
While the campus’s loaner program for laptops and internet access was active in the week before spring break, we are learning that some students may continue to lack the basic technology necessary to successfully complete their courses remotely. To help address this, a message has been placed on the CatCourses landing page encouraging students — both undergraduates and graduates — to report needs for a laptop, webcam and/or reliable internet access. Requests for these items will be addressed through the Loaner Laptop Program as quickly as possible, subject to technology availability. Should you know of students needing these resources, please direct them to the Loaner Laptop Program website .
 
Challenging Personal Circumstances and Student Success
 
Here are a few important situations we need to be cognizant of and proactive about:
 
Student Financial and Personal Obligations
﻿
Campus-based employment may be the only source of income for our undergraduates and their families. They may also be assuming responsibilities to care for their families.
 
What you can do: The campus is working actively to enable job continuity for our student employees. Please be aware of additional financial and mental burdens on students and extend grace and support to these students as they balance academic, financial and personal responsibilities.
 
Student Welfare
 
Students may experience circumstances related to their safety, security and personal well-being.
 
What you can do: Should you become aware of such concerns, please encourage the student to reach out to the Dean of Students or, in the case of graduate students, the graduate support staff in the schools, who can help connect the student to resources and support. Should you notice a student struggling or disengaging from a course, we encourage you to reach out to the student via text, email or other means to check in and provide support. If a student doesn’t respond, or if you have serious concerns about their well-being, you may complete a Student of Concern form ,and a UC Merced staff member will follow up.
 
Ascertaining Student Engagement
 
To identify and assist students who may face circumstances that impact their ability to pursue their coursework, you may find useful existing CatCourses tools that provide course and student-specific student engagement and participation information. A description of these tools and how to use them is available on the Educational Continuity for Faculty website under Strategies and Digital Tools: 13. Monitoring Student Engagement: CatCourses, Kaltura.
 
Most importantly, supporting students with continued flexibility in due dates and asynchronous instructional strategies to enable students to continue their education while addressing these needs is encouraged.
 
Additional Resources
 
Please continue to utilize the Educational Continuity for Faculty website and the Educational Continuity for Students website for tools and resources for continued success in this new learning environment. Resources are continually being updated in response to user questions and needs.
 
Please also review How to protect your Zoom sessions to secure your classes from the emerging problem of uninvited individuals disrupting Zoom meetings.
 
Student Pass/No Pass Option
 
Finally, on March 30, the Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option for their course(s) from letter grade to Pass/No Pass up to the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020 semester.
 
﻿As highlighted in the policy, such a change could have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that you talk with your students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their advisors, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarship before requesting this change.
 
In closing, we wish to recognize the dedication of our staff to facilitating the campus’s transition to remote instruction. We are grateful for all they have done, and will continue to do, as we collectively work to help our students successfully complete the semester and stay on course for their degrees.
 
Thank you, again, and please take appropriate measures to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and healthy — physically and mentally — and be kind to yourself, your colleagues, staff and students.

Dear Campus Community,
 
With overwhelming gratitude, we are proud of how our Bobcat community has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect our students, staff and faculty in the face of this pandemic, as well as to “flatten the curve” for the benefit of all. To create safety through all of this, our students have uprooted themselves while our staff and faculty have worked around the clock.
 
The personal adjustments you have each made have not been easy, and we thank you.
 
We are experiencing a global public health crisis that is affecting our communities and our families in deeply personal and sometimes devastating ways.
 
Unfortunately, crises do not affect everyone equally. Changes that are easy for some are nearly impossible for others, leaving many of our own valued community members feeling vulnerable, frustrated and unsafe.
 
Even as this crisis impacts us in different ways and we navigate unforeseen challenges, we are still a community. As such, it is important that continue to unite as a community grounded in our core values.
 
One of those core values is inclusiveness – valuing each unique member of our campus and greater communities.
 
As we continue to work and connect with each other through technology, we must center that inclusiveness. Dialogue, whether in person or remote, should be a respectful exchange of diverse ideas. We do not have to all agree but we can disagree respectfully.
 
We urge you to show up for each other with kindness, civility and respect in your everyday connections in these unique learning and sharing spaces. Below are some quick tips on how we can continue to do so:
 
Engage in active listening and create space for psychological safety.
Practice gratitude and mindfulness.
Be civil in electronic communications especially email .
 
To help maintain our community, the Offices of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the Ombuds will continue to offer ways for you to connect, including:

Over the course of just a few weeks, the world around you has changed, upturning every aspect of normalcy, including what should have been a spring semester of studying and celebration. Through this challenging time, in this uncharted territory, you have demonstrated resilience, flexibility and innovation. I would like to take a moment to express my deep gratitude for your ability and willingness to be nimble, as our faculty and staff work diligently to ensure you are able to continue making progress in your academic careers.
 
We are committed to keeping our campus community safe, healthy, informed and engaged. Below you’ll find important reminders to help you as we move forward.
 
Be Proactive: Review Your Account in the Student Portal
 
All students should confirm or update their address in “MyPersonalInfo.” Official information and documents, including refund checks, are sent to your permanent address on file.
Fall 2020 registration begins next week. Review MyDegreePath, your academic plan, and course schedule. Reach out early to your academic advisors and confirm your registration time.
Review your checklist. This is where you will submit required documents related to financial aid, health insurance and immunization requirements. Checklists are interactive and personalized for each student. Visit the Students First website to learn more.
Review the Bobcats Away Checklist to ensure you are meeting registration and financial aid deadlines.
 
We invite you to visit our Moving Forward: Guidance and Resources page where we have gathered these reminders and additional tools and resources to help you as we move forward. We will also continue to update the UC Merced COVID-19 student website with all announcements and resources.
 
We may never return to what we once considered “normal” life, but I am certain that our campus community will bounce back from this stronger than ever, and I promise to keep you informed as we learn more about how and when this will occur. For now, please be vigilant about protecting your health and the health of others. Work hard and study hard, but take care of yourselves and your families as well.

April 3, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
UC Merced has completed its first week of fully remote instruction. While faculty and students are navigating this new world together, we remain committed to delivering a world-class University of California education effectively and safely.
We know that online classes across the country have been invaded by outside individuals and groups pressing their agendas of hatred and bigotry. UC Merced stands strongly for inclusion and equity, and our Office of Information Technology is taking concrete steps to block this sort of hatred from interfering with our education by providing instruction and resources on security measures.
You should also be aware that UC President Janet Napolitano, my fellow campus chancellors and I have unanimously agreed not to lay off any career employees for at least the next three months, so staff can continue to focus on their work and their health and not their economic security.
Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with some of our colleagues who are still on campus, providing direct services to students and maintaining critical campus operations. I am amazed at the passion and dedication of all who work at UC Merced, and particularly of these folks who ensure students are fed, systems are operational and campus is safe during this challenging period.
Fresno’s ABC30 joined us for part of that walk around campus.
Our faculty have continued to share their insights with the world. Just a few examples:
Nicotine and Cannabis Policy Center researchers talk about the heightened risk smokers and vapers face during the pandemic.
Professor LeRoy Westerling examines the phenomenon of California city-dwellers fleeing to more remote areas to ride out the crisis.
Professor Ajay Gopinathan discusses the challenges and joys of establishing a new university.
And in a moment guaranteed to lift your spirits, ESPN recognizes senior volleyball player Joey Medina.
Finally, I want to call your attention to a critical national need: blood donations. On April 15 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Italo American Lodge in Merced, the American Red Cross will host a blood drive. I intend to donate blood, and I’d love to see the UC Merced community turn out to help our community.
I look forward to seeing you again face to face on our beautiful campus. In the meantime, please put your health and that of your loved ones first, and remember that even when apart, we are always a strong community.

Dear Campus Community,
 
I am impressed and proud of how our campus community is navigating these challenging times. Though we face many challenges, our resilience and commitment to each other continues to shine. Our office in collaboration with Student Affairs and many others are proud to support our campus community by providing resources and support in a variety of ways. We encourage your participation and active support of each other. Here are a few opportunities to explore:
 
This Week:
Virtual Healing Circle, led by Onar Primitivo, Director of Social Justice Initiatives, will be held at noon Monday, April 6 for any student impacted by Zoom hacking. A flyer with access information was sent to all students last week via Happenings.
PEN America’s Webinar Series ”What Professors Need to Know About Online Hate and Harrasment"" from 1-2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, April 7.
Virtual Dialogue Series hosted by the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion. The first session will be led by Jonathan Grady, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students from 1-2 p.m. April 9 and will address “Radical Healing Through Strategic Conversations for Staff & Faculty.”
 
Ongoing:
Monthly drop-in hours for faculty and staff, hosted by Dania Matos, Associate Chancellor and Chief Diversity Officer.
Weekly office hours for students, hosted by Charles Nies, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.
The Office of Information Technology in partnership with the Chief Diversity Officer is arranging the distribution of the app Calm for all faculty, staff, and students. Calm is the No. 1 app for Sleep, Meditation and Relaxation and has been named by the Center for Humane Technology as ""the world's happiest app."" We thank Interim Chancellor Nathan Brostrom and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Gregg Camfield for their generous support of this project. Look for more details coming soon.
 
Additionally, campus safety is a top priority for leadership. Zoom — which as become the platform we utilize to connect for classes, meetings, celebration and so much more — has fallen prey to uninvited individuals who threaten to disrupt these spaces through trolling, racism and vulgar content.
 
We are aware, tracking and taking action against this emerging phenomenon. We actively denounce these heinous acts, as they stand against who we are. We recognize the impact to those who have experienced them and are providing support and resources.
 
Every day, but even more so during this time, we are striving to promote safe, affirming and inclusive communities for all of our staff, students and faculty to thrive in their learning, working and researching, grounded in our Principles of Community.
 
Harassment, belittling, and attacks against any member of our community will not be tolerated. We want to take a moment to share campus support and resources that are available.
 
How to Protect Your Zoom Sessions, available from the Office of Information Technology.
Connect with resources designed to support you if you are impacted by these acts. For students, our Counseling and Psychological Services Office is aware and prepared to provide support via telehealth. For faculty and staff, our employee assistance program is available
Incident reporting is being developed to help monitor this activity. While it is usually external hackers who are trolling for links to these Zoom meetings around the world, if the university finds that a member of our community is involved in these acts, appropriate consequences would result.
 
Thank you for your help as we work diligently to prevent these intolerable acts from occurring.
 
We will continue to provide support and resources and keep you informed as they become available.

At UC Merced we are focused on the safety and success of our students, and of the faculty and staff who work so hard to educate and serve those students.
 
Consistent with the University of California’s mission of teaching, research and public service, we also seek opportunities to help our community. One such opportunity — made even more important by the current crisis — presents itself in Merced next week.
 
From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, April 15, the American Red Cross will hold a Merced Community Blood Drive at the Italo American Lodge, 1281 W. 18th St. It is sponsored by Assembly Member Adam Gray, a longtime champion for the people of the Central Valley and a great friend of UC Merced.
 
Assembly Member Gray and I have signed up to donate. If you are able to join us, you can register here , or find another drive closer to home.
 
I ask everyone at UC Merced who can safely do so to join me in donating blood. So many people are facing dire medical needs that require blood or plasma, and in this way we can do something incredibly positive during a crisis that has limited much of what we are usually able to accomplish.

﻿Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced we are working to address the current crisis, keep our students, faculty and staff safe, and provide the resources for educational continuity and success. We must also plan for the growth and sustainability of this university.
 
Our plans prioritize the people who make UC Merced great and contribute to the intellectual, civic, cultural and economic richness of the San Joaquin Valley — hence my enthusiasm for joining President Napolitano and my fellow chancellors in announcing we will lay off no career staff through this fiscal year.
 
What we do not yet know is the full scale and ultimate implication, at a state, national or global level, of the COVID-19 pandemic, so we must continue to be as fiscally prudent as possible while advancing our mission.
 
The Division of Finance and Administration will share specific guidelines about spending and personnel practices as we move forward. These will require us to make thoughtful decisions about university priorities. As you may know, every hiring decision is already scrutinized by our Position Delegates Council, under the guidance of divisional and school leadership; their criteria will now include a sharper focus on those positions essential to the university’s core goals.
 
But UC Merced has, from its founding, learned to create excellence with lean resources, and has over the years implemented a number of processes and policies that will, in our current challenge, stand us in greater stead than better resourced and less disciplined institutions.
 
I ask for your patience as we work through and communicate all the details about next steps. We will always continue to prioritize faculty, staff and students, their well-being, and the future of the university — because we know we are better together, and we are #BobcatProud.

April 10, 2020
To: Faculty, staff, students and parents
April 10, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
We are closing on a month since we moved education and most services at UC Merced to remote delivery because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While across the United States we are starting to see signs of hope, in Merced the effects of the virus are now starting to be felt more acutely.
 
As of Thursday, April 9, Merced County had 52 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , and it is unfortunate to note that one of the newest cases is a member of our campus community. The person has not been on campus since before spring break, and is now recovering at home in a private residence in Merced. Given the rapid progress of this crisis, the university will limit announcements to cases that present a significant change in circumstances or have broad impact on our community.
 
You should take note of the county’s latest directives , which include a clarification and strengthening of the requirement to stay at home, except for essential travel (educational institutions are categorized as essential); guidance to avoid gatherings; and a closing of public outdoor parks and recreational facilities (such as Lake Yosemite), though individual outdoor activity remains permitted, with appropriate distancing. The university has closed recreational facilities except for walking trails.
 
The county is also strongly encouraging the use of face covering for any interactions. We cannot agree strongly enough with this practice. On campus, our Emergency Operations Center will be distributing face covers to designated employees and students still in residence, starting Tuesday, April 14, in COB1.
 
We remain in discussion with the city and county about providing shelter to first responders in empty residence halls, should the course of the pandemic accelerate sharply in Merced. And I’d like to remind all from our community who have the ability to join me in donating blood on Wednesday, April 15, at the Italo-American Lodge in Merced.
 
Also, the University of California will be reaching out to those with UC-held student loans that are currently in repayment (such as Dream Loans, institutional loans and Perkins loans), announcing temporary measures such as a halt to interest accrual, collections actions, and late fees. This is another way the university is acknowledging the very real economic hardship felt by so many in our broad community.
 
Our amazing faculty continue to perform a great service by sharing their expertise with the general public. Some recent examples include:
 
An op-ed by Professors Nancy Burke and Irene Yen and Medical Education Director Thelma Hurd about COVID-19 revealing health disparities in the Valley .
Scientific American’s highlighting of Professor Anna Song’s research on the connection between smoking and COVID-19 susceptibility .
Professor Robin DeLugan’s thinking on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant farm workers .
Interviews by Univision and Radio Bilingue with Professor Marcos Garcia-Ojeda about curbing the spread of COVID-19.
CalMatters’ story on economic impacts of the virus , featuring commentary by Professor Ketki Sheth.
Deputy University Librarian Donald Barclay explaining the real danger of fake news in a time of crisis.
 
Finally, I want to remind everyone that there is news apart from COVID-19. Ten of our graduate students have advanced to the finals of our annual Grad Slam competition, and we are excited to see the final round on May 8. And the U.S. census continues its very important work, to which everyone should respond and be counted .
 
Please remember to take care of yourselves and your loved ones, and that even apart, we are better together.

10-Apr-20,579,"COVID-19: Position Control and Fiscal Responsibility Guidelines
April 9, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
Earlier today, Chancellor Nathan Brostrom wrote about the need for fiscal prudence as UC Merced plans to grow and thrive. In consultation with the UC Office of the President, we are evaluating various models to plan for potential financial impacts and help guide future decision making as we navigate the unknown future. In this process, we are implementing several proactive actions to protect jobs and continue the university’s mission.
Beginning today, April 9, 2020, every unit should undertake all possible cost-saving measures to sustain our campus priorities, including:
Carefully monitor expenses in final months of this fiscal year and delay any expenditures greater than $5,000 until our budget picture becomes clearer. Major expenditures should be approved by your manager/supervisor or department/division head. (Note: Contract and grant related purchases where reimbursement is assured should continue to move forward.)
Review your budget allocation and identify opportunities for immediate and long-term savings.
Refrain from submitting new requests to Human Resources for reclassifications, equity adjustments, stipends, contract and limited-term positions unless they are critical to the operation of the campus or to protecting the safety and well-being of the campus community, or will protect against significant compliance/legal risk.
Hiring and onboarding continues, but we are tightening our longtime position control process. Our Position Delegates Council will scrutinize each new position, under the guidance of divisional and school leadership; their criteria will now include a much sharper focus on those positions critical to accomplishing the university’s goals.
All new staff and academic recruitment will be paused except for:
Positions critical to the health and safety of the campus community and campus assets, such as public safety, health center and custodial staff.
Positions required to support the quality of remote instruction, student success during the crisis, and changes in research modalities that can be integrated into best practices after the crisis passes.
Positions nearing conclusion in their searches or for which offers have been extended, and remote work is possible.
Positions for which deferral would result in greater fiscal costs to the unit and campus, or reductions to or forgoing of revenue streams, or pose significant compliance/legal risk.
In addition, requests for new compensation review based on classification, reclassification and stipends should be paused. Requests for new and back-fill permanent positions, new contract positions and new limited-term positions will require approval from a dean or division leader and be reviewed against the above criteria. Finally, the STAR awards program will be temporarily suspended and compensation decisions traditionally associated with the performance appraisal process will be temporarily delayed until further clarity about the University’s financial situation is known.
Detailed instructions regarding the position management process, including how to submit new recruitments, will be communicated to managers and supervisors as soon as we evaluate current recruitments. This will be re-evaluated every three months.
Further, campus leadership is exploring how some staff can be redeployed across campus to aid in areas where there is an increased workload resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. This will allow employees who might otherwise not be able to work remotely to work on critical projects and engage with others.
Despite these challenges, I am sure we all share the optimism of President Napolitano: “While there may be turbulent financial waters ahead for the university, I know that through thoughtful and careful planning we will get through them together.”

13-Apr-20,709,"Spring 2020 Grading
April 13, 2020
Dear Colleagues,
The global pandemic during the spring of 2020 is extraordinary with wide recognition that it has disrupted lives in countless ways. The Federal stimulus package passed in the United States stipulates that institutions extend flexibility to their student population during the crisis. On March 30, the UC Merced Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option for their course(s) from letter grade to Pass/No Pass up to the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020 semester.
These guidelines are meant for undergraduates, academic advisors, and faculty to inform guidance on a P / NP grade choice. Academic advisors are an important resource for consultation. Please visit the Registrar website for information on grade options.
Changing the grading option to Pass/No Pass provides flexibility and could also have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that you talk with your students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their instructors, academic advisors, and their degree program(s) before requesting this change. The following are important considerations to guide decision-making:
For the Spring 2020 semester only, ALL UC Merced undergraduate programs have agreed to accept Pass/No Pass grades. UC Merced degree programs typically require students to utilize the letter grade option for all of their required courses. All undergraduate degree programs have agreed to temporarily waive this requirement only for the Spring 2020 semester.
Students who plan to apply for postgraduate/professional study: Letter Grade requirement. While a vast majority of educational institutions in the US have moved to providing a Spring 2020 Pass/No pass grading option, there is a small chance that Medical/professional/graduate schools may not accept a grading option of P/NP for some courses (referenced as “letter grade” requirement risk in the flowchart below).
Students working on raising their GPA to be in good standing: Students who need to raise their GPA above a 2.0 to be in good standing or for purposes of financial aid may be harmed by the adoption of P/NP grades as they are not included in GPA calculations.
Students who receive veterans benefits: Students who receive Veterans or Veterans dependent benefits should seek guidance from Campus Veteran’s Services: veteranservices@ucmerced.edu
Maintaining satisfactory academic progress for financial aid: In addition to GPA, a student must maintain “Satisfactory Academic Progress” (SAP). As indicated in the Federal Stimulus Package language, students choosing to adopt Pass/No Pass grading option will maintain SAP as Pass/No Pass grades still figure into the SAP calculation. Otherwise, P/NP does not have a financial aid impact.
Important information about the student’s decision
The grade P is assigned for a letter grade of C- or better. If the student earns a grade of D+ or below, the grade will be recorded as NP. In both cases, the student’s grade will not be computed into the grade point average.
Update 5/4/2020: The Senate has recently approved a P/NP grade change option for WRI 001 for Spring and Summer 2020. Original: Students may not change the grade option for WRI 001 to P/NP at this time. In order to satisfy the University of California English Language Writing Requirement (ELWR), students must earn a grade of C or higher in WRI 001 thus eliminating the option of P/NP in this instance.
Process for students interested in changing grading option
Students interested in making a grade option change should consult with an academic advisor on any of the above factors or additional questions and then go to MyRegistration - then Change Grading Option. Students have until Friday, May 8 11:59 pm PST, the final day of instruction of the Spring 2020, to change their grading option. There is a flowchart provided below that may be useful for some members of the UC Merced academic community as they work through grading option choices for our undergraduate student population.

James Zimmerman

TO: All faculty and TAs
April 14, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
We would like to follow up the April 13 general announcement about Spring 2020 grading and emphasize some relevant points for instructors.
 
The reasons for our current flexibility are multiple, with the two greatest being an acknowledgement that the learning context has radically changed and that these changes have created incredible stresses on both students and faculty. In part to alleviate stress on students, the Senate has given students the option to elect P/NP grading for any of their classes anytime between now and the final day of spring instruction, May 8.
 
On the one hand, there is no change in the grading process and the registrar will provide a reminder and details about grading near the end of the semester. On the other, we do ask that you consider making yourself available to help advise students as to the possible advantages and disadvantages of P/NP grades .
 
Related, we have received requests to provide instructors with additional time to submit final grades this semester and we have therefore worked with the Registrar in extending the grade submission date by one week. The registrar and the provost will send more details about that change later this week.
 
The Registrar’s Office can be a point of contact for any instructors who have questions. This information is also included on the registrar's webpage .

There is no more significant celebration at a university than commencement. Our hearts go out to the members, families and friends of the Class of 2020 for the delay of such an important in-person rite of passage. But we will create events that are memorable — both virtual on graduation day, and in-person at a later date to be announced.
 
The virtual ceremony, on Saturday, May 16, will allow graduates, their loved ones, and our entire campus community to celebrate the Class of 2020 remotely. Information and updates will be sent to graduates via their UC Merced email accounts and at commencement.ucmerced.edu .
 
#UCM2020 Journey
 
UC Merced is committed to commemorating the tremendous and diverse accomplishments of our Graduates by creating the #UCM2020 Journey Project. We invite our students, staff and faculty to submit photos, videos and messages for our graduates , and we will share some of these moments throughout the month of May as we reflect on our achievements and successes as a Bobcat community.
 
Student Speaker/Singer
 
Though our ceremony will be virtual, there will still be opportunities for graduates to participate as a student speaker or student singer. If you are interested in applying for either role, please review the requirements and criteria on the online application . The deadline to apply is Thursday, April 23.
 
Although a virtual commencement may not be the traditional celebration our campus is accustomed to, we look forward to making this experience memorable for our graduates and their families until we are able to come together again.

Human Resources staff continues to review and create programs to support UC Merced employees whose jobs and lives have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please read the information below. There is news for the hundreds of us who are working remotely, along with assistance for qualified child-care expenses and two programs that tap into our desire to help each other.
 
Telework Agreement Extension
 
Temporary telecommuting agreements are being extended through May 31. University employees working remotely who previously submitted a Temporary Telecommute Agreement need to complete a simple amendment form to extend the agreement. The form also asks you to note University property you brought home, such as laptops and phones. A report about the equipment will be sent to supervisors and managers for proper tracking once all employees are able to work at campus locations again safely. Keep in mind the Temporary Telecommute Agreement can be lengthened or shortened based on new information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Qualified Disaster Relief Payment Program
 
The Qualified Disaster Relief Payment Program (QDP) is new for UC Merced employees who are designated and required to work on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic. QDP will pay up to $1,000 for qualified child-care expenses. For more information about the program, contact Human Resources’ Benefits team .

UC Merced Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD), CARE, and UC Merced Police recognize that staying at home and experiencing physical isolation can create situations or circumstances which may be harmful for some members of our community, especially those experiencing relationship or family violence. Concerns about virus transmission introduce new approaches that may be used to impose control or manipulate a partner. Similarly, physical distancing restrictions may create additional challenges related to safety, health, privacy and confidentiality. External factors such as economic and health insecurity can add stress and create circumstances that further compromise safety.
 
UC Merced takes reports of sexual and domestic violence or any conduct that falls within the scope of the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy seriously and responds promptly to reports of such conduct. We are committed to continuing to support our students, staff and faculty who are affected by sexual and domestic violence and are quarantined at home with an abuser. All services continue to be available, including assistance with workplace, academic, and housing accommodations consistent with current COVID-19 guidance.
 
Our campus community practices bystander intervention. We encourage those who are able to do so safely to continue practicing bystander intervention, even though it may be more challenging given our remote environment. We can all play the role of active bystanders to stop behaviors or incidents from occurring. Thank you for your partnership in creating a safe and harassment-free community.
 
Finally, sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited by law and by university policy. This includes domestic and relationship violence.

As referenced in the April 14 message to instructors entitled “ Follow-Up Grading Information ,” the registrar has extended the spring grade submission deadline by one week to noon, Tuesday, May 26. This extension is designed to help ease some of the stress on you, but it has consequences on students and on the Registrar’s Office.

It is only after all grade point averages are calculated that staff can begin degree conferral, can distribute transcripts, and can determine academic standing and financial aid eligibility. Thus, we encourage you to make reasonable efforts to submit your grades by the original deadline.

Dear Campus Community,
 
UC Merced continues to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and plan for several potential futures, depending on the course of this pandemic and the implications of the response at a global, national, state and campus level. While a few members of our campus community have tested positive, so far they are well on their way to recovery. We still have not had any positive cases reported on campus among our designated staff nor the approximately 200 students still in residence whom they continue to serve.
 
Merced County has now recorded 82 COVID-19 cases. What has been driven home this week is the tremendous need in our community caused by the outbreak. A number of us from UC Merced joined Assembly Member Adam Gray and many colleagues on Wednesday in donating blood to the American Red Cross, and on Tuesday some of us joined members of the 1040th Quartermaster Company, California National Guard, and the California Conservation Corps at the Merced County Food Bank in packing food for those struggling to keep their families fed in our area. Both of these great community-based organizations say needs will rise as economic conditions remain unsettled for the foreseeable future. I hope, if you are well and able, you can continue to find ways to support your neighbors while we all work through these times together.
 
This week, we have communicated to our community about grading changes and resources for employees , particularly around personal safety while working remotely and leave options . Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and Chief of Staff Luanna Putney shared an inspirational message with campus, and more messages from campus leaders will arrive over coming days and weeks.
 
Perhaps most importantly, student leaders joined me in announcing plans for a virtual commencement ceremony on May 16, with an in-person ceremony in the future; please encourage all graduating students to submit photos, videos and messages to share at the ceremony.
 
Our faculty continue to share their research, insights and knowledge with the public, including:
 
Smoking may put people at greater COVID-19 risk , researchers say
 
Warning signs for fake coronavirus articles , experts weigh in

Finally, take a moment to read this great story about Dr. Van Do-Reynoso , one of our Ph.D. graduates in public health services and systems research, who is earning kudos as director of public health for Santa Barbara County. Her life has been an amazing journey, her work is critical to the health of hundreds of thousands of Californians, and her story illustrates so well why we do what we do at UC Merced.

Dear Colleagues,
 
UC President Janet Napolitano has communicated that, in light of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, current deadlines for completing written performance evaluations are suspended until Fall 2020. This guidance applies only to unrepresented staff. It is expected that represented staff will continue their performance review process per the original campus guidelines, consistent with expectations of collective bargaining agreements.
 
Performance management is a year-round responsibility. Supervisors are always encouraged to meet regularly with employees to review goals, achievements and progress. Because performance appraisals are a critical tool for feedback and professional development, we encourage supervisors to continue helping employees establish and prioritize goals for the upcoming year, especially during this time of uncertainty that is causing many employees to worry about their future work.
 
We also encourage you to use this time, if you’re able, to hone your skills in delivery of remote performance management. Useful tools for this can be found here .
 
We recognize that now more than ever, it is important for managers and supervisors to check in regularly with their employees, to talk not only about professional responsibilities, goals and development opportunities, but also about well-being and providing support and resources .
 
Many employees and their supervisors have begun or completed their summaries of accomplishment and appraisals. We applaud your commitment to this process.
 
President Napolitano also indicated that decisions concerning the merit pay program for policy-covered staff also is postponed until later this year when more information about the UC system’s financial situation is available.
 
When more guidance from the Office of the President is provided, we will share it. I appreciate the continued commitment of our managers, supervisors and staff to develop skills, assets and abilities that help our campus meet its mission. You are our most essential asset.

The work of UC Merced continues, in person and remotely, and I want to both thank you all again for the great effort you have put in to continue our mission and remind you that what we are doing now is not “the new normal.” We are exploring every day how and when it will be possible to safely restore operations for students, faculty and staff to fully experience a University of California education and culture.
 
As Gov. Newsom reminds us, what we must decide on is not a date, but a set of indicators. The work of the institution is important, but more important is the well-being of all of us in the UC Merced community. This means that the most important traits we can model are patience and hope. COVID-19 has not been easy for any of us, and a good part of the difficulty has been not knowing for certain when things will improve. So I thank you again for the patience that I myself have struggled with — moving quickly or arbitrarily is not a responsible path.
 
As of April 24, Merced County has reported 102 positive COVID-19 cases, half of whom have recovered. We have heard of no positive tests within the UC Merced community in several weeks, and those few of whom we were aware are on the mend.
 
In the past week, we have discussed changes to the employee performance review process for this year , and I hope you had the chance to read about the tremendous work of your colleagues in the spring edition of Inside UC Merced ; I call your attention particularly to the opportunities it offers for volunteering to help your community. I hope as well that you have enjoyed the new Interactive Virtual Campus Tour that highlights new and older facilities, faculty research and special benefactors of UC Merced; this is a wonderful resource for so many of us to share with potential students and colleagues as well as all those who want to learn more about the university.
 
I’d like to remind you once more of the virtual commencement ceremony on May 16, and encourage you to ask all graduating students to submit photos, videos and messages to share at the ceremony.
 
Media have featured the research and expertise of UC Merced faculty on a number of COVID and non-COVID topics:
 
Zulema Valdez, associate vice provost for faculty, discusses how universities can recruit and retain diverse colleagues during the pandemic: Diverse Issues in Higher Education
 
Psychological Sciences Professor Jennifer Howell talks about the effects of our calendars reminding us of all the events canceled during the crisis: Washington Post , Seattle Times , Daily Herald
 
Professor Katrina Hoyer of quantitative and systems biology explains her motivation for studying Valley fever: Science Friday
 
Christina Lux, associate director of the Center for the Humanities, published the poem “Passover Palms” in the new Community in Poetry section of the Merced County Times .
 
Finally, today is Bobcat Day — the time when so many admitted students and their families come to campus each year to learn more about UC Merced and the amazing education that awaits them. This year, it is a virtual celebration, and already 1,000 people have registered to join online for a special day being put together by the hardworking teams in the Division of Student Affairs.
 
Please remember to take care of yourselves and your loved ones, and remember that even apart, we are better together.

Re: Make Our Graduates Smile
To: All faculty and staff
April 28, 2020
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
We are all sorry to not be holding an in-person graduation ceremony for the hardworking class of 2020, but here is a way that faculty and staff can help make our virtual commencement memorable for our students. We know that nothing will make our graduates smile more than seeing your faces, the faces of the faculty and staff who have taught and nurtured them along their journey.
 
As such, we are planning to have the traditional processional of Elgar’s “ Pomp and Circumstance ” be sung (not well, but passionately) by all of us. Over the next three days, there will be a series of quick Zoom recording sessions, coordinated by faculty member Katie Brokaw. We would very much appreciate you logging into one of them to wordlessly (DUH, duh-duh-duh, Duh, Duuh) sing along to a recording of the song. The recordings of these Zoom sessions will then be spliced together for the ceremony.
 
Zoom sessions for Project Pomp will be held at the following times (you will be receiving invites to all of them and can attend whatever fits your schedule):
 
Wednesday, April 29 | 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Thursday, April 30 | 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Friday, May 1 | 10 a.m.
 
Guidelines on how this will work:
 
All you need to do is sing along; one orchestral recording will be playing in the background for you during the session, so that all are singing in the same key. Much of the recording will be overdubbed, so please don’t worry if you feel you aren’t a good singer!
Feel free to wear your Master’s or Doctoral robes if you have them, or a UC Merced shirt or lab coat, and to use a UC Merced virtual background . Kids and pets are also welcome! And if you’d like to hold up a congratulations sign or in any other way get creative, go for it!
After we record the song, faculty and staff signed into each session will also have the chance to stay on the call to record a personalized few seconds of video for the Class of 2020, verbally expressing congratulations.
Recording sessions will take between 10-30 minutes, depending on how much you’d like to record.
 
What makes UC Merced special is YOU. If you are able, please try to join one of these short calls over the next few days. It will mean the world to our deserving students, and might just cheer you up a bit, too.
 
Best,

April 29, 2020
Re: Fall 2020 Tuition and Fees
To: All students, faculty and staff
April 29, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
At UC Merced, we are working to make critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation — as is every university around the world. We have a website devoted to providing students with information about our response plans for COVID-19 that we update whenever new decisions or guidance become available, but we want to share the current state of our planning for Fall 2020:
 
Delivery of Instruction Decisions for Fall 2020
 
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with state and county public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. We are planning different scenarios, as we look to health experts and the data to help inform our decisions, and the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.
 
Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instruction. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so.
 
We are making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe public health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing.
 
Decisions about broadly offering Pass/ No Pass (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation will be like in the fall.
 
Tuition and Student Fees for Fall 2020
 
Tuition and mandatory fees for Academic Year 20-21 have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.
 
Campus-based fees support campus services, maintain facilities, and broadly support and preserve the campus infrastructure. As campus operations adjust to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated team of professionals remains committed to delivering the highest quality service possible. Campus-based fees will still be collected to support those efforts.
 
Student Housing for Fall 2020
 
Under normal operations, all incoming first-year students are required to live on campus for their first two academic years. It is not possible to know now whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in changes to operations in student housing and residence education in Academic Year 2020-2021.
 
Consequently, we may not be able to meet all of the requests for on-campus housing that would allow students to fulfill UC Merced’s two-year residency requirement.
 
We will keep our residence halls open unless we are required by public health authorities to close. If students choose to live in campus housing and conditions affecting in-person instruction change either prior to the start of the semester or during the semester, we will allow students the opportunity to seek a full or pro-rated refund of housing and dining costs.
 
Students in off-campus housing should pay close attention to the terms of their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Students should consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease for more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Students can learn more about off-campus housing services at https://och.ucmerced.edu/ and can seek advice through the UC Merced Law Clinic before signing leases.
 
We thank everyone for their understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform our community of the latest developments as we plan for the coming fall.

4-May-20,621,"Guidance for Summer Session Grading
May 4, 2020
Dear Campus Community,
The 2020 global pandemic is extraordinary, with wide recognition that it has disrupted lives in countless ways. The federal stimulus package passed in the United States stipulates that institutions extend flexibility to their student population during the crisis. The UC Merced Academic Senate approved an amendment to the Emergency Course Continuity (ECC) policy allowing undergraduate students to change the grading option from letter grade to Pass/No Pass (P/NP) up to the final day of instruction of any course in the Summer 2020 session for which they are enrolled.
These guidelines are meant for undergraduates, academic advisors and faculty to inform guidance on a P/NP grade choice. Academic advisors are an important resource for consultation. For information on grade options, see https://registrar.ucmerced.edu/policies/grades/updates-grading-options.
Changing the grading option to P/NP provides flexibility and could also have important ramifications for an undergraduate’s educational progress and goals. As such, we ask that instructors talk with their students about the possible benefits and costs associated with P/NP grades, and encourage them to consult with their academic advisors and their degree program(s) before requesting this change.
The following are important considerations to guide decision-making:
FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE SUMMER 2020 SESSIONS, ALL UC MERCED UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT P/NP GRADES: UC Merced degree programs typically require students to utilize the letter grade option for all of their required courses. All undergraduate degree programs have agreed to temporarily waive this requirement for all Summer 2020 sessions.
STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO APPLY FOR POSTGRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDY — Letter Grade requirement. While a vast majority of educational institutions in the U.S. have moved to providing a Summer 2020 P/NP grading option, there is a small chance that medical/professional/graduate schools may not accept a grading option of P/NP for some courses (referenced as “letter grade” requirement risk in the flowchart below).
STUDENTS WORKING ON RAISING THEIR GPA TO BE IN GOOD STANDING. Students who need to raise their GPA above a 2.0 to be in good standing or for purposes of financial aid may be harmed by the adoption of P/NP grades, as they are not included in GPA calculations.
STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE VETERANS BENEFITS: Students who receive veterans or veterans dependent benefits should seek guidance from UC Merced’s Veterans Services: veteranservices@ucmerced.edu.
MAINTAINING SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID: In addition to GPA, a student must maintain “Satisfactory Academic Progress” (SAP). As indicated in the Federal Stimulus Package language, students choosing to adopt P/NP grading option will maintain SAP, as P/NP grades still figure into the SAP calculation. Otherwise, P/NP does not have a financial aid impact.
PASS/NO PASS DEFINITION: The grade P is assigned for a letter grade of C-minus or better. If the student earns a grade of D-plus or below, the grade will be recorded as NP. In both cases, the student’s grade will not be computed into the grade point average.
Process for students interested in changing grading option
Students interested in making a grade option change should consult with an academic advisor on any of the above factors or additional questions, and then go to MyRegistration and select the Change Grading Option. Students have until the final day of instruction of the 2020 Summer session for which they are enrolled to change their grading option. The flowchart below may be useful for some members of the academic community as they work through grading options.

6-May-20,470,"CARES Act Funding for Student Aid
May 6, 2020
To: All undergraduate and graduate students
May 6, 2020
 
Dear Students,
 
As part of the CARES Act, UC Merced has applied for and been awarded approximately $13 million. Half of that money is designated for direct support for students, the other half to assist the university with financial loss and additional expense incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universities are still receiving direction from the federal Department of Education on guidelines for the institutional support, and recently received final clarification on the direct student aid support. We have posted that guidance on our Student Resource page .
 
The federal criteria included students who are Title IV financial aid eligible and guidelines that it be disbursed during the current academic year (spring and summer). UC Merced established a work group to develop principles and a proposal to disburse the funds to UC Merced students.
 
The campus principles include:
Recognition that all students have been impacted by COVID-19.
Funds should go to student populations with the highest financial need.
Allocations should be awarded with ease for students.
Financial support for students during this pandemic will be coordinated with other support for students, including Basic Needs, Rapid Rehousing and Emergency Funds.
Institutional funds will be identified to provide some assistance to students who are undocumented and who filed a Dream application.
 
Awards will be provided to students who meet all of the following eligibility criteria:
Title IV aid-eligible;
Currently enrolled in spring and/or summer;
Did not receive a prorated housing and meal plan refund in the spring (excluded from receiving a spring CARES Act award, but may be eligible for a summer award if enrolled or a special circumstances award);
Not enrolled through UC Merced Extension or in a non-degreed program.
 
By the end of the week, we will start to disburse funds to students who have a FAFSA on file, which verifies Title IV eligibility. For students, particularly graduate students, a process will be communicated on how to submit a FAFSA. Students who were eligible for relief in their housing and dining plans will have that refund considered in their eligibility for CARES Act funding. For students who may not meet eligibility criteria, a process will be shared with those students on how to request special circumstance funds, which will be a coordinated use of federal, institutional and emergency funds. An additional allocation of funds will be available to support students registered for UC Merced’s summer session.
 
Please know that there are resources available beyond the CARES funds. The Dean of Students Office website is a good place to start. You can also go to the Basic Needs website.
 
Please let me know if you have questions or if we can assist.
 
Take care,

May 8, 2020
Re: Weekly Briefing from the Chancellor
﻿To: Faculty, staff, students and parents
May 8, 2020
 
Dear Campus Community,
 
California acted early and swiftly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in part due to that decision, it now appears the state can begin easing some restrictions based on local conditions. While that bodes well for retailers, restaurants, manufacturers and other businesses — and those who rely on them for employment — UC Merced is still considering when and how to safely return to in-person instruction and student residency on campus as we prepare for the 2020-21 academic year.
 
Please be assured that faculty and staff are actively planning for multiple scenarios — from modified in-person instruction to hybrid course delivery to a continuation of remote learning — with, of course, the goal being a return to in-person coursework as soon as it is safe to do so. We are rigorously examining what the “new normal” should be for classrooms, labs and residence halls, based on projections from state, federal and UC scientists. While our mission remains teaching, research and public service, our priority will always be the safety of our campus community.
 
Over the past week, we have communicated to campus about federal CARES Act student aid distribution and guidance for sum mer session grading . We also recently added an “EN ESPAÑOL” link on the COVID-19 Parents page , where campus communications are available in Spanish.
 
UC Merced faculty continue to share their research and expertise through the media:
 
A study by a team including Suzanne Sindi of applied mathematics about fatal diseases caused by prions .
 
Political scientist Haifeng Huang’s interpretation of world opinion toward China because of COVID-19.
 
Sociologist Edward Flores’ projection of the number of Central Valley workers left out of current federal relief programs.
 
Don’t forget to join us online May 16 for a truly amazing virtual commencement ceremony — the first in the history of the University of California — to celebrate the success of our graduates. And on May 15, our signature Innovate to Grow event will happen online as well. Our normal lives may be on temporary pause, but the great work of UC Merced continues.
 
Please keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.

27-Jan,"Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,

The University of Houston has been closely monitoring the emerging outbreak in China of the novel Coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV since its announcement to the public this month, and we maintain regular contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest information.  Raising awareness and keeping the University community well informed of this rapidly evolving situation is very important.  Since the first case was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, there have been a growing number of reported cases including several in the United States.  We have not identified any cases at our UH campuses.  There have been no reported cases in Texas at this time. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers this new Coronavirus to be a serious public health threat, they consider the immediate risk to the American public to be low at this time.

In regard to this new Coronavirus and general preventive measures, we feel it is important for staff, faculty and students to:

    Recognize the symptoms of this illness which may include a high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, similar to what you may feel with the flu or a bad cold.
    Seek care and immediately notify the University if you have recently traveled within China and are experiencing these symptoms.
    Always practice good hygiene, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid sharing food, cups or utensils.
    Make sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid personal contact with sick people.
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, shared items; and lastly,
    Get a flu shot.

The incubation period (how soon the symptoms appear from the time of first exposure) for this kind of virus is typically 10-14 days.  Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections, including infections with 2019-nCoV.

Seeking care

For Students

Those who have recently visited China and are experiencing influenza-like illness, with fever greater than 100.3, and symptoms, including cough, body aches, severe sore throat, or runny nose, should consider seeking medical attention for the possibility of the flu, especially if symptoms worsen.  You can contact the Student Health Center at 713-743-5151 and identify yourself as having flu-like symptoms.  You may also consult with your regular health care provider or seek treatment at a local health center if you are overseas.

Faculty and staff who are ill with flu-like symptoms should stay home and contact their personal physician for further advice.

Travel

The University encourages the UH Community to heed U.S. Government warnings related to travel in China due to the uncertainty about where and how rapidly the virus is spreading, as well as limited capacity to assist travelers impacted by travel disruption or quarantine while abroad. The CDC currently recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to the Hubei Province, China including Wuhan and follow new developments at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/china#travel-notices. In addition, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Travel Advisory to reconsider travel to China.

For additional information about Coronavirus, including signs and symptoms, transmission and risk of exposure, and what to do if you are exhibiting symptoms, please refer to the links below.  The CDC’s website and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will also issue guidance for those planning to travel or who have recently returned.

28-Jan,"Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,

At this time, the University of Houston System is prohibiting all travel to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and non-essential travel to China outside of Hubei Province in adherence to U.S. Federal Government travel warnings resulting from the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV.

While the UH System places great value in our work and on our many partnerships in China, including exchange programs, and intends to continue these initiatives, our highest priority is the health and wellbeing of our UH System Community. At this time, the health risks associated with the uncertainty about where in China and how rapidly the virus is spreading, outweigh our institutions’ academic and research endeavors and necessitate travel restrictions.

On Jan. 27, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory to China, recommending reconsideration of travel to anywhere in that country, as well as a Level 4 Travel Advisory to completely restrict travel to Wuhan and Hubei Province. On Jan. 23, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan and Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions in the area.

Also on Jan. 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended its Warning Level 3 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where the first case of the new Coronavirus was identified, to now include all of China. A Warning Level 3 instructs individuals to “avoid all non-essential travel to this destination. The outbreak is of high risk to travelers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk.”

The UH System remains in close contact with our federal, state and local government partners and will continue to monitor this situation closely. While we regret any temporary disruptions to our endeavors in the region, we look forward to fully re-engaging at such time the health risk to our UH System Community associated with the new Coronavirus has diminished.

Sincerely,

2-Mar,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,

The University of Houston continues to closely monitor the global outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease. We will continue to keep our community informed as developments occur. To date, we have not identified any cases at our UH campuses. However, as Coronavirus has become much more prominent in the United States and has begun to spread more rapidly through parts of Europe and Asia, it is incumbent upon all of us to remain aware and vigilant of this potentially serious public health threat.

Travel

The UH System is restricting travel to all countries for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Warning to avoid all nonessential travel related to Coronavirus. The CDC applies this warning to countries in which there is widespread community transmission. At this time, the CDC has issued the Level 3 Travel Warning to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Due to rapidly changing conditions, anyone considering international travel is advised to monitor the CDC’s website for the latest updates regarding travel and COVID-19.

As Spring Break approaches, the University further recommends that everyone in the UH Community examine your personal travel plans and make changes or take precautions where necessary. The University encourages the UH Community to heed all U.S. Government travel warnings related to the novel coronavirus. In recent days, both the CDC and U.S. Department of State have expanded their warnings. Refer to these links to view the latest warnings:

CDC Travel Warnings: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices

U.S. Department of State Travel Advisories: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/

About Coronavirus

Prevention continues to be the best protection for this as well as reducing your chance of contracting other respiratory illnesses caused by influenza, parainfluenza and RSV viruses. This includes staying home when you are sick, which cannot be emphasized enough. Professors will be flexible with students missing instruction or in-class assignments and tests.

In regard to this new Coronavirus and general preventive measures, we feel it is important for staff, faculty and students to:

    Always practice good hygiene: wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid sharing food, cups or utensils.
    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
    Make sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid personal contact with sick people.
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
    Get a flu shot.
    Recognize the symptoms of this illness which may include a high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, similar to what you may feel with the flu or a bad cold.
    Seek care and immediately notify the University Student Health Center and your health care provider if you have recently traveled to any country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Warning and are experiencing these symptoms.
    Stay home when you are sick.

The incubation period (how soon the symptoms appear from the time of first exposure) for this kind of virus is typically 10-14 days.  Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections, including infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Seeking care

For Students: Those who have recently visited China or any of the newly identified affected areas (per ongoing travel advisory updates) and are experiencing influenza-like illness, with fever greater than 100.3, and symptoms, including cough, body aches, severe sore throat, or runny nose, should consider seeking medical attention for the possibility of the flu, especially if symptoms worsen.  You can contact the Student Health Center at 713-743-5151 and identify yourself as having flu-like symptoms to obtain further recommendations and guidance.  You may also consult with your regular health care provider or seek treatment at a local health center if you are overseas.

Faculty and staff who are ill with flu-like symptoms should stay home and contact their personal physician for further advice.

The University remains in regular contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest information and will continue to provide updates to the UH Community when warranted.
For additional information about Coronavirus, including signs and symptoms, transmission and risk of exposure, and what to do if you are exhibiting symptoms, please refer to the links below.  The CDC’s website and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will also issue guidance for those planning to travel or who have recently returned.

We continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities. The international profile of our universities, which includes routine travel abroad in both official and personal capacities, means we must be especially vigilant in determining when anyone in our universities has become potentially exposed to the virus and take responsible actions to contain and prevent its spread.

The University of Houston System has issued a COVID-19 Exposure Prevention Statement It requires any students, faculty or staff returning from travel to countries under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Level 2 or Level 3 Travel Warning related to coronavirus to self-quarantine for a period of 14 days away from campus. This ensures that anyone who has returned and develops symptoms of COVID-19 will not inadvertently spread the virus to others on our campuses.

As Spring Break approaches, it is important for anyone considering personal international travel especially to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy or Japan  to clearly understand the implications on their return to the United States and to campus.  As Chancellor, my number one priority is to ensure that our universities remain safe and healthy.

For a detailed explanation of this policy statement and additional information about COVID-19, please visit this UHS website.

Sincerely,

Chancellor, University of Houston System",Houston
6-Mar,"Dear Faculty:

There are now five confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Houston area. Should those numbers increase in the next days and weeks, the primary public health effort will be to reduce the spread of infection by limiting the amount of time large groups of people spend together in close proximity.

In the event of a large-scale COVID-19 outbreak, the University of Houston will join this public health effort by cancelling all in-person, face-to-face classes and limiting face-to-face, one-on-one instruction until such time as it is advisable to return to campus.

Should we face a large-scale outbreak, as an alternative to conducting in-person, face-to-face classes, the University of Houston will require all faculty instructors to teach their current spring 2020 classes employing a remote, online format, using either the Blackboard or CourseWare learning management systems. All spring 2020 classes currently have a Blackboard class shell which can be accessed by faculty instructors through the Blackboard Learn portal icon via the AccessUH page. Registration and details for upcoming online sessions, quick tutorials, and additional resources for Blackboard can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis

Please send any questions to provost@uh.edu.

Warm regards,

9-Mar,"Dear Students,

As we continue to see more and more news about the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus), I know that you and your families must be anxious, because we all are. As I assured you last Wednesday, we continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities.  There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 on our campuses; however, there have been some cases identified in and around Houston. According to reports, all of these cases involve foreign travel.

It is the time to exercise prevention, not panic. The safety of our faculty, staff and students is our top priority. We must take all necessary precautions suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but we must also commit to playing our role in containing the outbreak of the virus in our community. With this in mind, I am providing you with the following information.

Communication regarding COVID-19

The UH Health Liaison, Dr. Vanessa Tilney and the UH Office of Emergency Management continue to work with local, state and national authorities on a daily basis. Any and all updates related to the university’s operations will be available on the UH COVID-19 (Coronavirus) webpage which you can access from uh.edu.  You will receive emails and alerts as necessary but I am asking you to please keep checking updates on the webpage because this situation can change rapidly.

Travel is restricted

The University of Houston is now restricting all international travel at least through the end of March and is continuing to require off-campus self-quarantine of 14 days for traveling to any country on CDC’s travel warning list at Level 2 or Level 3 for COVID-19.  Written approval is required before any student may return to campus after self-quarantine. For your own safety and the safety of those around you, please consider your risks and options carefully when making decisions regarding personal travel.  If you must travel abroad (to any international location), you are instructed to register on the UH COVID-19 website.

Classes will continue

Classes are continuing in their current formats at this time.   At some point in the future, we may decide offering some or all classes online is the appropriate decision to make for the safety of our faculty, staff and students.  We will certainly move to online instruction immediately if instructed by local, state or national authorities and will update you with logistics as necessary.

Community responsibility

You should act responsibly as a community member if you are sick.  If you have a cough, fever, shortness of breath or other symptoms of contagious illness, you should seek medical attention to ensure it is safe for you to attend class and be on campus.

For questions related to COVID-19, you may write to coronavirus@uh.edu.

We care about you, we care about your learning and instruction, and we care about your future.

With warm regards,

As I assured you last Wednesday, we continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities.  There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 on our campuses; however, there have been some cases identified in and around Houston. According to reports, all of these cases involve foreign travel. With this in mind and after extensive consultation, I am asking that you please adhere to the following.

Travel restrictions through March

    Refrain from all international travel. The University of Houston is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.
    Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please  evaluate your options carefully. 
    Consider your risks and options when making decisions about personal travel.
    Self-quarantine for 14 days if you have traveled abroad to a country for which the CDC has issued a Level 2 or 3 travel warning for COVID-19. It applies to all travel, personal or professional, since February 25th.
    Register yourself on university’s COVID-19 website if you have taken or will take any international travel – professional or personal—since January 31st.

Continuity of Classes

    In adherence to university policies, each college/department has a “Continuity of Operations Plan” on file.  Provost Short has asked deans and department chairs to ensure that everyone is familiar with their plan and that classes could continue if we have to limit access to campuses.
    In certain circumstances and if instructed by local, state or federal authorities, all in-person classes may migrate to the digital platform.  In cases where pedagogy is not suitable for online instruction, individual faculty should make alternative arrangements so the semester is not disrupted. Every course already has a shell on Blackboard; however if you need any help, workshops are offered by the Office of the Provost.
    We will keep small computer equipped areas on campus open for those students who do not have access to a laptop.

Continuity of Research

    Please evaluate your needs in relation to your research. Since every researcher has different needs, please make sure that your dean and department chair are aware of your situation so that appropriate accommodations can be made. 
    You may also contact the Division of Research for any questions and/or concerns.
    Additional information for researchers will be forthcoming from the Provost and Vice President for Research.

Continuity of Other Campus Operations

    Each support unit will evaluate its “Continuity of Operations Plan.” We are asking all unit heads to familiarize their teams with their unit’s plan.
    We do not expect to cancel classes or close the University. Please note that essential support functions will continue and staff may be directed to work from home.

Communication and Update

We expect the situation to change on a daily basis.  While we are prepared to send emails and alerts as and when necessary, please see the University of Houston COVID-19 webpage for the latest updates and actions. You may access this page from the home page. You may direct your questions to your supervisor and, if necessary, you may also direct them to coronavirus@uh.edu.  A list of useful questions and answers will be posted on the page as well.

Community responsibility

Finally, Dr. Vanessa Tilney, the university’s executive director of the Student Health Center, has been designated as the university’s health liaison.  Dr. Tilney and the team continue to be constantly in touch with local, state and federal experts.  We are working with cities and counties wherever our campuses are located, with the Texas Medical Center, state authorities, and the CDC.

You should act responsibly as a community member if you are sick.  If you have a cough, fever, shortness of breath or other symptoms of contagious illness, you should seek medical attention to ensure it is safe for you to be on campus.

10-Mar,"Dear Department Chairs and Associate Deans for Research:

We are aware our researchers need access to laboratories should we have to work remotely. With that in mind, please review and share the guidance below concerning access to laboratories with your faculty members and principal investigators.
 

    For those individuals who need access to labs because of ongoing research activities (i.e. faculty, students, technical and research staff), they should be listed as essential personnel in the department’s Continuity of Operations Plan delineating not only who they are, but also where will they be working. This information should be prepared by the department and be readily available if requested by the Office of the Provost, the Division of Research, UH Police Department, or Emergency Services.
     

    Principal Investigators are required to establish clear written protocols for who should individuals call or contact if there are any health and safety issues that arise when working in the lab with minimal supervision from senior faculty and/or staff.
     

    Principal Investigators are asked to be mindful of the interactions between them, their students, or their research staff to limit physical interactions.
     

    Additional sanitation is mandatory for work-stations, lab bench-tops, communal equipment, and common areas that each individual has been in contact with before and after they visit the lab.
     

    Principal Investigators should cancel all lab meetings and significant gatherings during this time and organize virtual lab meetings through the Microsoft Teams software that all UH employees have access to, or allow faculty to create Blackboard shells for their lab groups as if they were a class. Both platforms have the capability for real-time online virtual meetings, written information sharing, and/or communications.
     

    Principal Investigators are required to consider delaying the start of activities that require lab personnel to congregate (e.g. additional in-person training, tasks that require multiple personnel).
     

    If there are regular recurring  lab activities that require by policy more than one person to perform (e.g. liquid nitrogen tank filling, equipment change outs, etc.), then the Principal Investigators should designate a specific team of the same individuals to perform those recurring tasks during the time there is limited access to the labs.
     

    It is expected that the UH Animal Care Organization will take all the steps above, taking into account the special needs of animal husbandry and other necessary daily operations and maintenance.
     
    Principal Investigators who are currently conducting research involving human subjects should, if appropriate and does not increase risk to subjects, consider postponing data collection activities. The Research Integrity and Oversight (RIO) Office in the Division of Research will be issuing additional guidance to those investigators with active research protocols. For any immediate questions concerning human research projects, please contact the RIO Office (cphs@central.uh.edu).

If you have any questions, please email provost@uh.edu and we will route them to the appropriate individual.",Houston

11-Mar,"Dear UH Student:

As communicated by President Khator yesterday, the University of Houston is taking extraordinary steps to mitigate the possibility of our students, faculty, and staff contracting COVID-19. This is being done while also making every effort to continue instructional activities during the spring semester.

In response to city and county emergency health declarations, we will be transitioning all classes to an online format in an effort to limit large gathering and to practice social distancing. No face-to-face classes will be offered on campus at the University of Houston, UH at Sugar Land, or UH at Katy until at least April 6.

In order to ensure a smooth and efficient transition to online delivery, the University has instituted a one week pause in all instructional activities beginning Monday, March 16, including existing online classes. This will include all tests, exams, and assignments due during the week of Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. During this instructional pause, your faculty instructors will be preparing to deliver all classes remotely beginning Monday, March 23.

If your instructor is currently using either Blackboard or Courseware as part of your current class, they will continue to use them. If not, you will be able to access your class through Blackboard on Monday, March 23. If this is the case, please login to Blackboard to access the online version of your face-to-face class. Faculty instructors have been asked to contact all of their students through Blackboard, Courseware, or email beginning Monday, March 16. It is important that you respond to your instructor so that they are confident that you have remote access to your class.

During the one week pause in all instructional activities from Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21, you are required to take the following actions:

    Login to access your online class (or classes) through either Blackboard or Courseware and respond to your instructor’s messages. If your instructor also contacts you by email please response to that email as well. In either case, you are required to establish contact with your instructor by Wednesday, March 18.

    You will receive a copy of your modified class syllabus from your faculty instructor no later than Friday, March 20, detailing how your class content will be delivered remotely. 

    CASA will be closed Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. A decision will be made at that time regarding CASA’s further operations.

    Classes will resume remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continue online at least until Saturday, April 4.

If you have questions about your courses, please reach out directly to your faculty instructor through Blackboard, Courseware, or via email. I am committed to keeping you regularly updated of any changes to our schedule concerning remote operations, or any broader city or county developments that may impact the health and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.
 
As we navigate through these challenging circumstances together, I assure you that faculty will continue to deliver the highest quality of education regardless of the format. Please continue to monitor your UH email as well as uh.edu. For specific questions about the impact of COVID-19, please reach out to coronavirus@uh.edu.

12-Mar,"Dear Staff:

Following the recent announcement from President Khator, it’s important to note that the University, including the University of Houston at Katy and the University of Houston at Sugar Land, will remain open, and all offices and services will continue operations at this time.  While this is a very rapidly evolving situation, we currently do not anticipate any change in the services provided at each location or instructional site.  Please know that should there be any changes to our operational status, you will be notified by an official announcement from the University accordingly.

As part of overall ongoing response and business continuity processes and procedures, your health and safety as a valued team member is our utmost priority.  In support, we have taken several actionable steps in this regard, including the following:

Health and Hygiene

    Increased cleaning and sanitation protocols for facilities, including all food service locations and high-volume “touchpoints,” such as commonly used door handles, elevators, vending machine areas, among many others, as well as the deployment of hand sanitizer dispensers, and discontinuing the self-service option at all dining locations.
    We are also rigorously following the “Guidance for Workplaces and Businesses” as outlined by the City of Houston Health Department.  

Temporary Telecommuting Workplace Arrangement Request Process

As a result of this rapidly evolving response, there may be circumstances where a flexible workplace arrangement may be an effective alternative within your team, program office or department if you are able to continue to perform your work functions from a remote location. 

Please know that the approval of a flexible workplace arrangement will be considered by your immediate supervisor and next level leader on an individual basis. As with any temporary arrangement, your immediate supervisor and/or next level leader may discontinue the flexible workplace initiative at any time.  To proceed with the process to request working remotely on a temporary basis, the following University of Houston Telecommuting request form https://uh.edu/human-resources/forms/uhs-telecommuting_form.pdf is required for completion by each employee to be submitted to your immediate supervisor to begin the review and approval process.

Helpful Resources

As these are extremely anxious and uncertain times, it’s important to note that there are additional resources provided by the University, including the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), telemedicine, and elder/child care service options. For more detail on benefits eligibility, please click here: https://uh.edu/human-resources/hr-communications/benefit-services-communication-3.11.2020.pdf

All departments should review and update your Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) and share them with your staff to ensure essential functions can continue if a disruption of service occurs. Plan templates may be found here: https://uh.edu/emergency-management/planning-and-response/business-continuity-plans/.

12-Mar,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

Since my last communication regarding the university’s response to COVID-19, President Trump as well as state and local officials have announced additional efforts to slow its spread, or “flatten the curve.""

Following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and federal, state and local health officials, my leadership team has been working to adjust operations with regard to the health, wellbeing and safety of our UH community.   I encourage you to consult our website regularly.

The University of Houston is open for operation and services. No classes are being held this week and all of the instruction and most of the operations will be conducted remotely from March 23 until at least April 4.   To comply with guidelines issued by the City of Houston, all retail and dining establishments on campus will convert to takeout orders only, effective immediately. Social distancing procedures are being introduced in residence halls, libraries, workspaces and student spaces.  A decision with regard to commencement will be made next week.

The purpose of this communication is to put things in perspective and offer you additional guidelines as it comes to your day-to-day decision-making.

In the coming weeks, our goals are:

    To continue our educational mission by offering instruction and support services to students.
    To keep university functions and services operational.
    To attend to resident students still living in university housing.
    To attend to the needs of those students most in need, whether financial, academic, mental, physical or otherwise.
    To keep the research labs operational and productive.
    To keep all facilities fully sanitized and clean by following the protocols of the CDC.

To this effect here are some important things you should know:

    Faculty and staff may work from home to the extent they are able to perform job functions remotely and with appropriate approval from their supervisors. More clarity will be forthcoming from Human Resources to answer questions that you might have.
    The University is open for those who need to physically come in and for those who are asked to come in due to the nature of their work. Please continue to take the preventive actions as recommended by the CDC.
    With guidance from the CDC and local officials, we discourage events with groups of 10+.
    We are committed to protecting your salary and benefits irrespective of your job category to the fullest extent possible based on state requirements.  We want you to take care of yourself and your family and to do your part in the controlling the outbreak.  We also want to find ways for you to balance your personal and professional lives.

12-Mar,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Thank you so much for working so diligently to face the crisis and for the solutions you’ve provided no matter what the challenge. I am proud and grateful to be with you. Most of you are working from home but some of you are on campus keeping the essential services going and/or leading the troops.  My team and I thank you all, but particularly those who are on campus.

I wanted to let you know that after careful consideration and consultation, we have made the following three decisions. You can refer to my letter to students for more details.

    All classes will be offered remotely for the rest of the Spring Semester.
     
    Graduation ceremonies have been postponed until late summer/early fall.
     
    In the context of the current  breakdown of our economy and the long road ahead, the Board of Regents has asked us to not take any new financial obligations because they (and we, too) are witnessing layoffs and pay cuts in almost all businesses around us.  To comply with this directive and to be committed to the people already on the payroll, I have asked vice presidents to put a 30-day pause on signing off on any kind of new financial obligation including hires, contracts, procurement, etc.

During this time, we can come together and work out different scenarios and see what our best options are. This is not a hiring freeze but a 30-day pause to carefully formulate our strategy through the process of shared governance. Your guidance through deans/directors or Faculty Senate/Staff Council will be extremely important.

Thank you again for your dedication, commitment and engagement.

With warm regards,
Renu Khator",Houston
17-Mar,"Dear Students --

During this very difficult situation, we have been listening intently to you and your families.  Preserving health and safety has been first and foremost in every step we have taken and every decision we’ve made.  In the final analysis,  our students and UH community are who matter most to us. With that in mind, the following decisions have been made:

ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, STUDENT LIFE, AND EVENTS

    Spring 2020 courses will be offered remotely (online or alternative format) beginning March 23 and for the duration of the semester. We are currently working through details on online test proctoring, labs and other considerations. I am asking faculty members, deans and university leaders to work to accommodate student needs throughout these difficult times.  Computer labs are open for those who need them and resources for off-campus Wi-Fi are available from UIT. 
     
    Spring 2020 Commencement will be postponed. Canceling graduation would be detrimental to all of the hard work our students have done to earn their degrees. We will begin planning for a late summer or early fall commencement as soon as public health conditions and operational guidelines allow.  Delaying the graduation/commencement ceremonies will not delay the actual conferring of degrees to May graduates. The latest updates, including new information about cap and gown orders, and rescheduled dates can be found here as the information becomes available.
     
    Events sponsored by the University are canceled, no matter the size, through the end of April.  Rather than continuing to provide updates based on the latest federal, state or local size limitations, we prefer to provide clear guidance for the near term.  These restrictions include conferences, symposia, and social gatherings.  This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.

STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

    Residential housing will remain open for those who choose to stay or return and complete your course work remotely for the remainder of the semester.  If you plan to move out of housing and not continue in housing through the remainder of the semester, please follow the process that Student Housing & Residential Life will outline for you soon.  You will receive further information about the refund/credit of your unused amount for these services in addition to parking.  We will work with you on any specific needs, and we thank you for your patience.
     
    All dining establishments operating on campus, retail and residential, have converted to takeout orders only to comply with guidelines issued by the city of Houston and to promote social distancing.  More information on unused balances on dining plans will be communicated in the next week.  For more information on hours and locations, please visit dining services.

    Cougar Cupboard  in partnership with the Houston Food Bank is open and available for students who require access to additional food.
     
    M. D. Anderson Library will remain open with computer labs available to those in need and online material available for access. Beginning March 23, access to the library will be limited to UH students, faculty and staff.
     
    UH Cougars Care community SharePoint is available to allow peer-to-peer support and help for faculty, staff and students.  Visit AccessUH to begin your conversations.
     
    The Student Health Center will continue to be available for non-emergency, outpatient medical care to currently enrolled UH students.  Appointments may be scheduled by calling 713-743-5151 during regular business hours.
     
    UH Counseling and Psychological Services is waiving session fees and/or no show and late cancel charges for all appointment types. CAPS remains open and will assess for the most appropriate treatment option which may include referrals/resources, crisis services, phone sessions, or an in-person appointment.
     
    Telehealth is available for current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students to connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat.
     
    The Campus Recreation and Wellness Center is temporarily suspending in-person workouts in the facility through April 4, but it is providing opportunities for remote workouts.
     
    The Student Center is open, but closing each night at 10 p.m. until further notice.
     
    Please refer to our university COVID-19 website for the latest updates and resources.

We are in the midst of an extraordinary challenge, and the situation continues to change rapidly.  But there is one thing that will not change – this University’s commitment to do what is best for our students.  We will work through this together, remaining safe and continuing our educational mission. I know we can do this.

With warm regards,

19-Mar,"To the Campus Community: 

I want to call your attention to important updates regarding COVID-19.

In order to safeguard the health and safety of our university community, any faculty, staff or student returning from any international travel or having close contact with anyone who has been confirmed to have COVID-19 will need to self-quarantine for 14-days and receive approval before returning to work/campus.

If you have not registered your international travel to any location outside the United States, you must do so before returning to campus.

Due to the increase in the number of cases related to community spread, we are implementing two new reporting requirements.  First, faculty, staff and students who have reason to believe that they have been exposed to an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19 must report that information to the university.  Second, faculty, staff and students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must report that diagnosis to the university.

Those required forms are on the university’s COVID-19 website: https://uh.edu/covid-19/

We realize many people may still have questions about COVID-19 or have begun to experience a variety of heightened emotions during this period of uncertainty.  Please know that UH has resources available that can provide support for you including the following:

    Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers an array of services intended to meet your needs where you are.  The phone number is 713.743.5454.
    Current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students can connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat using Telehealth
    Employees can visit the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to find self-help tools and learn more about the resources available.  Employees can also call to schedule a free, confidential appointment with one of their many skilled professionals.

Please keep your community responsibility in mind.  Actions everyone can take to mitigate the spread of infection include everyday preventive measures, like good handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue and staying home when you are sick. The CDC provides helpful information about these “nonpharmaceutical interventions”.  Employees will be sent home if they come to campus with symptoms of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.

We are a campus community that is rising to meet the challenge, adapting to different learning and working configurations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We shall remain a caring and cohesive community of resilient Coogs.

19-Mar,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

Much has happened in our country since my last communication and we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. Cities and states are taking further measures to limit human contact and slow the spread of COVID-19.  

Today, Harris County issued a Stay at Home order beginning at 11:59pm tonight through April 3. What does this mean for us?

Similar to universities in other cities and states which are under Stay-at-Home order, the University of Houston is expected to continue its operations remotely. As a state public university, we also continue to seek guidance from state authorities and work with other state universities on how to safely fulfill our mission and continue to operate. With this in mind, please note the following:

    University of Houston will continue delivering instruction remotely, the process we began on Monday.  Faculty have transitioned thousands of courses online and will be flexible. Staff have been innovative in using new and creative ways to support students.  And students have been diligent in shifting to the online platform. Together, we will make it work.

    A pass-fail option for this semester is currently under consideration by the appropriate faculty bodies. Any decision and details implementing it will be communicated before the end of the week.

    Student Housing & Residential Life remain open until the end of the spring semester, however we are encouraging students who can go home safely, to go home until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted. Additionally, students who have already planned to move out may still move out today. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.

    All UH locations will expand their social distancing efforts by reformatting programs and support services. It will involve less direct contact and more remote support. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.

This is an extraordinary time. Our own university community has confirmed two positive cases of COVID-19. In both cases, individuals had not been on campus and any person who may have been in contact with them has been notified.

Continue to check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information. Please take precaution and preventive measures whether you are 18 or 81.  We are one connected piece of society’s make-up and only we can help control the spread in our community.

Thank you for being a resilient Cougar.  We are all in it together and we will all pull through this together.

With warm regards,

19-Mar,"Dear Undergraduate Students:

In response to the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and upon recommendation by the Faculty Senate Undergraduate Committee, the University of Houston is implementing an Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy.

This policy provides students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis and applies to all undergraduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session.

The deadline for students to choose their grading option is 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.  Details regarding the process through which students make this choice will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar by April 27, 2020.

The University of Houston is taking these steps to help you be successful during our current extraordinary circumstances. Together, we will prevail and overcome all the challenges we face.

Warm regards,
",Houston
24-Mar,"Dear Graduate and Professional Students:

The University of Houston wants you to continue to be successful in your courses this semester despite the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the University is implementing an interim policy for graduate grades that will benefit you and help mitigate these extraordinary circumstances we are facing.

The policy provides most graduate students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis. Should you choose this option, it means that if your course's current grading scheme is Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grades of Satisfactory will remain the same, and grades of Unsatisfactory will convert to No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR). 

If your course's current grading scheme is letter grade, then students with a grade of C- or higher may choose to receive the Satisfactory (S) grade instead of the letter grade. For grades below C-, students may choose to receive the No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) option instead of the letter grade. 

I encourage you to read fully the policy online, but here are several key highlights:

    The Interim Graduate Grade Policy applies to all graduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session. The policy will be reviewed for continuation through future terms if necessary. Professional students should check the full policy to determine eligibility and should contact their program with questions.

    You will have the opportunity to review your spring semester grades and then choose your grading option for the semester as the deadline for you to choose is not until 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.

    More details regarding the process through which you will choose your grading options will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar near the end of the semester.

    Satisfactory (S) and No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) grades are not factored into term or cumulative GPA.

To assist graduate students who are graduating this semester and are working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission of your thesis/dissertation has been extended to May 22, 2020.  Please check with your college regarding the college submission deadlines.

While we have structured this new policy to benefit you, I strongly recommend you contact your academic advisor to discuss questions regarding the impact of your grade option choice on academic matters. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid should also be consulted to discuss the impact of your grade option choice on financial aid matters.

The University believes in you and your academic pursuits, and we have made these changes to help you overcome the challenges we face. After reading the policy, should you have questions, please reach out to grading@uh.edu.

Warm regards,",Houston
25-Mar,"Dear Undergraduate Students:

As Provost, I recognize the extraordinary challenges faced by students as they work to successfully complete their courses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I appreciate your thoughtful questions following yesterday’s announcement of the Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy. The policy was designed specifically to provide you with the flexibility to choose a course-by-course no-risk alternative grading option to meet your needs and goals.

To help you better understand the policy, I am including the following graphic and key points.

Important Policy Highlights

    The Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy applies to all undergraduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6, as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session. The policy will be reviewed for continuation through future terms if necessary.

    You will have the opportunity to review your spring semester grades and then choose your grading option

    You may make different grade choices for different classes, choosing to keep some letter grades, to receive a grade of Satisfactory (S) for letter grades D- or above, and to receive No Credit Reported (NCR) for grades of F.

    Any letter grades you choose to keep will be used to calculate your GPA; Satisfactory (S) and No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) grades are not factored into term or cumulative GPA.

    The deadline for instructors to post grades is May 11, 2020, and then you will have until 5:00 pm on May 18, 2020, to select the grading option you prefer for each class.

    The process through which you will choose your grading options is being designed now, and more details will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar by April 27, 2020.

I encourage you to read the full policy online. It will answer many of your questions. Should you have additional questions, please send an email to grading@uh.edu. We are working on adding Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to the website. Your success at the University of Houston is our primary mission. We are committed to making sure your academic life proceeds as seamlessly as possible this semester.

26-Mar,"Dear Research Faculty,

We are actively monitoring the local and global health situation around the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. We intend to keep research and research support services functioning as normally as possible, including labs, core facilities and service centers. Funding agencies have not issued any notice affecting proposal submission, awards issuance or other impactful changes to sponsored research activities as it relates to COVID-19. 

We understand you may be concerned about possible disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements and want to share current guidance and assure you of our support as the situation develops. 

Research-related travel:

    The University is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.
    Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please evaluate your options carefully.
    Canceling your travel:
        If you have already made and paid for travel arrangements on grant funds, please work with your department’s business staff to request refunds to be credited back to the award. If a refund is not possible and the expenses will remain on the award, you must provide supplemental documentation outlining the refund denial to support the charges.
        To date, there is no federal guidance related to charges of cancelled non-refundable travel expenses due to the coronavirus. We will continue to follow the University’s travel expense policy and the Uniform Guidance.  The University’s Travel Information page has been updated to address costs of canceled travel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and concerns. 

Funding research staff and students on grants:

    Working Remotely  In the event the University of Houston closes/cancels operations due to COVID-19, research staff and students supported on grant funds can be paid provided they remain engaged and continue to work on the project remotely.
    If working remotely is not an option, due to the nature of work on the project, the award should not be charged salary. Faculty wishing to retain such staff should work with their Chair and Dean to bridge fund such positions. In the event there is a need to terminate employment you must follow university written policy, which usually requires a 30-day written notice to the employee. If the researcher is unable to continue to work on the project, and is key personnel with committed effort, NIH and NSF policy require notifying the program officer regarding disengagement and effort reductions.
    Absence Due to Illness  If a researcher is absent from work due to illness their salary can continue to be paid from the award in accordance with MAPP 02.02.03 Leaves of Absence.

Delays:

    Program managers must be informed, in writing, of any delay in the project scope of work caused by disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements. If the delay will result in a late progress report, this information must be conveyed before the report becomes due.
    Most federal agencies, including NIH and NSF, do not grant approval for late submissions. Agencies do have policies that address extenuating circumstances. If you have a specific situation that can be considered an extenuating circumstance, please contact the agency Program Official and your UH preaward contact for guidance.

Research awards with human subjects protocols:

    The IRB, through the Office of Research Integrity and Oversight, has provided additional guidance for human subjects research. The information can be found on the Division of Research website under COVID-19 Information and Resources. 

Agency responses to COVID-19 and additional resources:

    Federal Agency Guidance: Agency Updates Specific to Federal Award Impact

26-Mar,"Dear Faculty:

We are facing an unprecedented public health situation with the repercussions of the COVID-19 virus and its effect on our communities. Thank you for remaining flexible and accommodating during this time.

In response to the City of Houston and Harris County emergency health declarations, and to do our part in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the University of Houston will immediately cease all face-to-face instructional activities (i.e. lectures, seminars, discussions or presentations) and deliver all of our classes remotely using online and/or virtual learning platforms, at least until April 4. 

In order to ensure a smooth transition to online delivery, we have instituted a one week pause in all instructional activities beginning Monday, March 16, including existing online classes. During that week, we must ensure that our students are aware of the implications of this transition and prepared to take classes remotely beginning Monday, March 23.

Monday, March 16 – Saturday, March 21
We ask that you do the following during this week: 

    Monday, March 16 – Please initiate regular communication with your students through Blackboard or Courseware class shell and via email. Inform your students that there will be a one week pause in all class activities, including all tests, exams, and assignments due during the week of Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. CASA will also be closed March 16 – March 21. A decision will be made at that time regarding CASA’s further operations.

 

    Tuesday, March 17 - Saturday, March 21 – Modify your class curriculum to reflect how you will deliver the remainder of your class content using either asynchronous instruction (i.e. online presentations, discussion boards, reading assignments, etc.) or synchronous instruction (i.e. virtual face-to-face sessions using Blackboard Collaborate, Microsoft Teams, etc.). Ensure that any additional online tools to deliver your class content are enabled and that instructions for their use by students are available within your Blackboard or Courseware class shell. Students must be informed of these curricular changes by posting of your updated curriculum to your class shell no later than noon on Friday, March 20.  

Additional information and resources for faculty instructors, including registration details for upcoming online help sessions, quick tutorials, and additional resources for Blackboard and other tools can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis.

Monday, March 23 - Saturday, April 4
All classes previously taught face-to-face will resume online through Blackboard or Courseware. Students will not be on campus for instruction. Information and additional resources for faculty instructors using Blackboard and other related online tools will remain available throughout the period of remote operations, and can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis.


Additional Considerations

With department chair approval, faculty members who are most vulnerable or at high risk of contracting COVID-19 will be allowed to continue providing instruction online through the end of the spring semester.

Guidance on how faculty members can gain access to research laboratories can be found here. Please contact the Division of Research if any you have any additional questions concerning research operations.   

I am committed to keeping you regularly updated of any changes to our schedule concerning remote operations, or any broader city or county developments that may impact the health and well-being of our faculty, students, and staff.  As we work through these extraordinary circumstances, I know you will work to deliver a high quality education to our students regardless of the format. I deeply appreciate your willingness to work with me as we navigate this situation together.

Dear Cougar Families,

I hope this communication finds your families safe and healthy.

Due to COVID-19 we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. I want you to know that the University of Houston is dedicated to the academic success of our students, as well as to their physical and mental wellbeing.

The University continues to move quickly as events unfold during these uncertain times. This includes actions taken to comply with the Stay Home, Work Safe order issued by Harris County, which includes Houston, on Tuesday, March 24, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. This order is in place through April 3. Measures the University has already taken allow us to easily comply with this order and protect the safety of faculty, staff and students.

A comprehensive list of changes the University has implemented can be found on UH’s COVID-19 website. I encourage you to consult this website regularly for the latest updates. Here, I want to share with you some of these decisions made by University leadership.

Here are some important updates:

    As remote online instruction continues, all UH campuses will expand social distancing efforts by reducing or modifying programs and support services. On-campus functions will be limited to supporting essential services;
    The M.D. Anderson Library will be closed effective March 25 and until further notice, including computer labs. Students in need of computer access should consult the UH Remote Learning website for resources available;
    Student Housing & Residential Life expects to remain open until the end of the Spring semester; however, we are encouraging students who can go home safely to do so until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted;
    An interim Undergraduate Grade Policy has been enacted, which will allow undergraduates to choose a letter grade that counts toward their GPA if they received a D- or above, or choose an “S” satisfactory if they passed the class, or take an “NCR” no credit recorded if they did not pass the class. The “S” and “NCR” will not impact their GPA. Students may make different grade choices for different classes.

The Division of Student Affairs and Enrollment Services will continue to serve students remotely, via phone, email or online chats. Many services now offer virtual options, including live chats for career counseling, teletherapy sessions from Counseling and Psychological Services, telehealth from the Student Health Center and online workouts from Campus Recreation.

We have posted a summary of how to access services on our website.

Although this is a challenging time, I am confident that the Cougar Nation will persevere. The University of Houston’s faculty and staff remain committed to ensuring student success despite the circumstances.

Please take care of yourself and your families.

3-Apr,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

I hope you and your families are safe and well, and secluded like I have been. As a sign of the times, my family came together virtually to celebrate our granddaughter’s 7th birthday. We didn’t get any cake, but we’re doing our part to keep this virus from spreading and not contribute to the dangerous workload of our heroic healthcare workers.

Looking forward to the summer, not even our most knowledgeable health experts can predict with certainty when the threat of COVID-19 will subside. But we do know it will be with us for some time and so will the need for social distancing. That is why my leadership team and I have made the decision to continue delivering remote instruction for all four summer sessions, which begin June 1, and the May mini-session.

Even with classes online, we still have about 1,600 students living in on-campus housing and dedicated staff who are preparing food, cleaning and sanitizing our buildings for those who must access their office or lab, and police and security officers on their regular patrols. Even though we are enforcing social distancing and following all guidance from health officials, it is not lost on me the anxiety that is felt by those people whose presence at the workplace is essential to support delivery of education. I truly appreciate you all.

Finally, I want to recognize our faculty who have adjusted to holding class online and our researchers who are testing potential drugs to fight COVID-19 and applying technology to protect health care workers on the frontlines. Where we can, the University of Houston is also providing much-needed resources to people on the frontline in the greater Houston area.

It’s a reminder that treating patients and stopping the spread of COVID-19 indeed takes all of us. Together we will get through this.

With warm regards,
Renu Khator",Houston
6-Apr,"Dear Faculty: 

First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. These are unprecedented times and the many professional and personal challenges we all currently face are trying and difficult. In the midst of the truly universal impact of COVID-19 on our campus community, our nation, and the world, I am deeply impressed with how each of you has faced the many challenges of rapidly transitioning to online teaching while showing an extraordinary level of commitment to your students. In one week, you transitioned over 6,500 course sections to an online format while simultaneously learning to use a range of new tools and processes. Each day brings new challenges, and each day you continue to rise to meet them. I am grateful for your tenacity and resilience, without which I know it would be impossible to continue our primary mission: educating our students. 

The current circumstances have required us all to make many changes in the way we work, teach, and advance our research. Thus, I want to ensure that the Office of the Provost continues to provide the help and support you need as a faculty member to remain up-to-date on policy changes and new opportunities for assistance and resources. Going forward, I will be sending regular newsletters to you that include information on topics in which the faculty has expressed an interest, including web links to policy updates and FAQs, specific dates and times for virtual office hours with my senior staff, and announcements of online opportunities for self-care through the FED and the ADVANCE Center. 

Over the past two weeks, through our shared governance process, and in close collaboration with the Faculty Senate, we have implemented a range of policy changes to lessen the frustration and concern of both our students and our faculty in these challenging times. In this newsletter, I want to focus on those policy changes and announce dates and times for virtual office hours to afford you the opportunity to have your specific questions addressed personally.

Undergraduate Students 

As our students may be facing a number of challenges associated with our transition to online classes, it is critically important that we identify and engage with those students who have not yet responded, or otherwise made contact, since we began our remote instruction on March 23. With that in mind, you will be receiving a follow-up email with instructions on how to respond to a Navigate Progress Report Campaign toward the goal of successful course completion. 

We have instituted an interim grade policy for undergraduate students. The graphic below was shared with undergraduate students following the announcement of the change to help them make the best academic decision at the end of the semester.

Graduate and Professional Students 

A similar interim grade policy is in effect for graduate and professional students. In addition, to assist students who are graduating this semester and are currently working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission has been extended to May 22, 2020.

On March 18, deans and department chairs received an email providing initial guidance concerning the process for requesting an extension of the probationary period due to the current situation. Guidelines on extension of the probationary period due the impact of COVID-19 will apply to both tenure track (TT) and promotion-eligible non tenure track (NTT) faculty members. 

Faculty members may request an extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure under existing provisions in the current P&T and NTT policies for “Extension of the Probationary Period for Emergencies.” Extension requests related to the negative impact of COVID-19 on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure may be made by a faculty member at any time during their probationary period up until March 1 of the year in which the mandatory review is scheduled. For those faculty members currently scheduled for mandatory review beginning in fall 2020, the March 1, 2020 deadline for the Provost to review such requests has been extended until May 31, 2020.
Current policy allows up to two, one-year extensions of the probationary period for birth or adoption of a child. Faculty members who have already received two previous extensions for birth or adoption of a child may request an additional extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progress toward promotion and/or tenure.

Forthcoming annual updates to the P&T and NTT policies for the 2020-2021 review cycle will be issued by May 1 and explicitly reflect the above accommodations. 

Student Course Evaluation Committee 

I have appointed a committee charged with developing an interim policy on student course evaluations. Faculty Senate President Jeronimo Cortina is serving as the chair. The committee is developing an interim policy which acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on faculty instruction and educational practice. It will provide recommendations to me on the most appropriate role student course evaluations should play in assessing student learning and faculty instructional effectiveness during the disruption caused by COVID-19. The interim policy will be implemented within the next two weeks and will apply to all classes taught during the spring and summer 2020 semesters.

The current membership of the committee is: Dr. Vallabh Das (Faculty Senate President-Elect), Dr. Susie Gronseth (Faculty Senate Secretary, EDU), Dr. Jason Draper (Faculty Affairs Committee, HRM), Dr. David Shattuck (Undergraduate Committee, ENG), Dr. Rheeda Walker (CLASS/PSYCH), and Ms. Nia Soherta (MEC, Office of the Provost).

Below are several dates for Virtual Office Hours to answer any specific questions you may have on the topics covered in this email. A link to join these virtual sessions can be found on the Office of the Provost COVID-19 Resource webpage.

13-Apr,"Dear Students: 

Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we have all experienced an extraordinary, sudden shift in how our university delivers and receives academic instruction. This was not easy for anyone involved, but necessary for the University of Houston to fulfill our responsibility to deliver a Tier One education, regardless of the circumstances.

Recognizing that all of you are juggling this change with uncertainty in your personal lives, the University is providing assistance to help overcome short-term resource and financial obstacles and ensure you can continue your studies.

Summer School Changes
Registration for summer school is now open and I encourage you to consider enrolling in one or more of the classes being offered online. The University is making additional changes that benefit you:

    The interim grading policies for both undergraduate and graduate students have been extended to include all summer 2020 sessions.

Additionally, the University is waiving fees for the summer sessions as follows:

    For students taking six credit hours or more during summer 2020, all mandatory fees will be waived;
    For students taking less than six credit hours during summer 2020, all mandatory fees except extended access fees will be waived.

Computer Loaner Program
If you have not been able to access your course materials because you do not have a computer to use while you are learning remotely, we have a limited number of computers available to check out to complete coursework for the duration of the spring semester. The University began reaching out to students last week who have not accessed course materials, starting with seniors. Students who need access to a loaner or who need other assistance with technological needs related to their classes may contact the UH IT Help Desk at 713.743.1411 (call or text), or email support@uh.edu.

There is no question these are stressful times for everyone. No matter the challenges we are all facing, our priorities are to ensure your health and wellbeing and that your education continues without interruption. I urge you to consult the University’s COVID-19 website for additional resources, including access to Counseling and Psychological Services and answers to many frequently asked questions.

Warm regards,

17-Apr,"Dear Faculty and Staff,

We are deeply thankful and proud of the way each of you has responded to our rapid shift in operations, while juggling your own personal challenges, to meet our vital mission of teaching, research and service. These are far from normal times, and your dedication is nothing short of amazing.

The short-term and long-term financial prognoses for the economy – and specifically higher education – are challenging due to the events surrounding COVID-19.  We are now experiencing declines in many essential sources of revenue, which is coupled with an increased need for student financial aid and uncertainty about future enrollment.

While the University has taken a number of steps to immediately reduce expenses and prepare for future financial uncertainty, we must also keep in mind our fiscal responsibilities. Thus the current 30-day pause on new financial obligations, scheduled to expire on April 19, will be extended to Aug. 31, the end of our fiscal year, or until further notice.

Specifically, this includes the following guidelines:
Human Resources

HR activities including the hiring, promotion, reclassification, or position funding changes – and all salary adjustments using central and auxiliary funds, or more specifically state, tuition, course fees, indirect costs, campus auxiliary fees, student service fees, athletics and other local revenue – are suspended.  Transactions including any combination of centrally allocated funds and other non-centrally allocated funds are not exempt from this suspension.  

Exceptions will exist on all funds on a case-by-case basis to facilitate the hiring of faculty reappointments, including adjunct faculty and graduate students who will continue to teach classes already scheduled for the summer.  Similarly, activities on positions using gift funds, federal grants, research grants or sponsored projects may continue.
Procurement

To help us conserve our current financial resources and slow the rate of spending through the end of the fiscal year, all contracts, procurements, and purchases by any method, including procurement cards and travel cards that utilize central funding and auxiliary sources, are suspended.

Exceptions to these guidelines for Human Resources activities and Procurement will continue to require approval of the Division VP, the Provost, and the SVP for Administration and Finance.

We recognize these guidelines are difficult and will touch every aspect of the University, including academics, administration, operations and support services, and athletics, but we strongly believe the continuation of these actions is a prudent move given the fiscal uncertainty of our situation.  We appreciate your continued understanding and support. 

Regards,

24-Apr,"Faculty and Staff –

Effective Monday, April 27 until further notice, the University of Houston is now requiring face masks for those faculty and staff working on-campus in situations where they are in close proximity (within 6 feet) of others. This requirement is also directed to all who are visiting campus, including students, contractors and visitors (10 years of age or older).   This measure is being taken in light of recent recommendations from the CDC, the federal government and Harris County regarding wearing face coverings.

Please note that face coverings do not need to be worn in the following circumstances:

    When working alone in a single office
    When engaging in physical activity outside
    When doing so poses a greater mental or physical health, safety or security risk
    While operating outdoor equipment if not appropriate from a safety standpoint
    When consuming food or drink

Individuals are asked to wear a face covering (examples include bandana, scarf, handkerchief or other homemade mask) that covers their nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings should be washed daily. The use of surgical masks, surgical N-95 respirators of other medical masks is strongly discouraged to maintain the resources for health care providers and first responders. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing and regular handwashing. Continue to keep a distance of at least 6 feet between yourself and others.

Resources for Making Your Own Face Covering

    CDC guidelines including how to make a simple face covering: Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19.

4-May,"Dear Colleagues,

I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. We have come to the end of this very unusual spring semester. Thanks to your efforts, which included transitioning thousands of classes and services online, more than 6,000 students will graduate next week.  Congratulations … to all of us!

Here are some important updates for you.

Reopening the University: Earlier this week, Gov. Abbott announced a plan to safely reopen Texas.  I had already appointed a UH System Reopening Task Force under the co-chairmanship of Vice Chancellor Amr Elnashai and UHV President Robert Glenn.  The task force approved seven guiding principles and nine questions to be answered before reopening the system universities. In consultation with the task force, we are reopening the University in four phases: (1) research operations (2) low-touch, low-risk administrative operations (3) all operations and athletics, and finally (4) classroom instruction.

On Tuesday, May 5, research labs at UH can be opened by those researchers who wish to do so. This is voluntary, not mandatory.  Certain administrative services necessary to assist the researchers will also open. The Division of Research will soon send out an email with details.

A few measures have been taken to ensure a safe working environment as we reopen that include:

    Anyone working in a lab will be required to complete a training module, pass a self-health screening test and is expected to cooperate with contact tracing. The training and screening can be found on AccessUH beginning Friday, May 1.
    All CDC and state rules of social distancing will be followed, including the use of face masks if anyone is working in close proximity of others (within 6 feet).
    UH Facilities will adhere to strict rules to clean and disinfect common spaces and arrangements must be made to clean and disinfect lab areas per CDC guidelines.
    Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 or suffering from any respiratory illness will not be allowed in labs.
    Lab personnel will follow proper UH protocol if a positive COVID-19 case is identified in a lab.   

We are closely monitoring public health conditions in the state and the city and will provide further instructions for the next phase based on future developments. Until then, all faculty and staff –with the exception of those who choose to open their labs or are classified as essential support personnel – will continue to work from home.

Summer semester: All summer sessions will be taught online. In view of financial difficulties faced by students, the Board of Regents  has waived some fees for summer enrollees, saving many more than $300 per student. At this point, our summer enrollment looks very strong and we hope to continue the trend.

Fall semester: We expect to resume face-to-face instruction in the fall.  However, we are making plans for three scenarios: fully online, fully on campus, and some form of hybrid. Depending on the public health conditions in the city, we will make that determination sometime in late May or early June.

Commencement: Knowing that our students want to walk across the stage, we have postponed May’s commencement exercise until fall. However, several colleges are hosting virtual memory-sharing events, and we will also do something symbolic to recognize this very important milestone in our graduates’ life.

Emergency aid to students: The CARES ACT included $18 million in direct emergency aid to UH students.  From these funds, we are able to provide support to more than 26,000 students. While we are grateful for these funds, we know that the need is far greater than the allotted funds.  The Cougar Emergency Fund, which is supported by donations, will offer additional assistance to students in need. Finding another way to help, our IT department secured 300 loaner computers for students who were without that vital educational tool.

University Budget: Our fiscal year ends at the end of August, so it is difficult to predict the exact loss of revenue for the University.  The final number will depend upon three factors: state budget reduction, summer and fall enrollment, and available federal or state stimulus funds. Looking at the impact of COVID 19 on the overall economy and the declining state resources because of the oil crisis, it’s logical to assume that our budget will be stressed. I have appointed a Financial Task Force under the chairmanship of Provost Paula Short and Senior Vice President Jim McShan to review all financial tools at our disposal. We are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best and always keeping the well-being of our Cougar family in mind.

Thank you, once again, for your dedicated service.  If you have any questions, you can direct them to the chairs of the Financial Task Force or send them to COVID-19 email (coronavirus@uh.edu) or check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information.

Please stay safe and healthy!

With warm regards,
Renu Khator",Houston

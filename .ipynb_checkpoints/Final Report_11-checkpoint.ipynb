                               Dear Students, UC San Diego Student Health Services has been working with UC San Diego Health Infection Prevention and Clinical Epidemiology regarding an outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that started in December 2019. This outbreak has resulted in more than 500 confirmed human infections in China, with 17 deaths thus far – limited to the Wuhan region and exported cases in Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and the U.S. All infections were in persons who had traveled from Wuhan, China. To further protect the health of persons in the U.S. during the emergence of this new coronavirus, the CDC began entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan to the main ports of entry in the United States. UC San Diego is working with UC San Diego Health Infection Prevention to identify students that may have an infection due to the Wuhan coronavirus, in order to expedite their care and to minimize the risk of transmission to other students. If you have been in Wuhan, China within the past 14 days and you develop a fever with cough or difficulty breathing, please call Student Health Services at 858-534-3302 or 858-534-6296. Let the nurse you speak to know that you were in Wuhan and that you have a fever with cough or difficulty breathing. We will ensure that you are promptly evaluated. When Student Health Services is closed, please call our After Hours Advice Nurse at 858-534-3300 or go to the UC San Diego Health Urgent Care or Emergency Room. In good health, Stacie San Miguel, MD Director of Medical Services Student Health Services UC San Diego Health         285\n",

healthy, especially during this time of the year with increased flu activity and reports of an outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. We ask you to join us in our efforts by protecting yourself against the flu, knowing what to do if you have flu symptoms and educating you about coronavirus. What is the Coronavirus? The 2019 coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan City a few weeks ago and has been linked to a large seafood and animal market. The first confirmed case in the United States was reported on January 21, 2020 in the state of Washington. The virus occurred in a patient with respiratory symptoms who had recently returned home from Wuhan City. There are currently no known exposures to the coronavirus in San Diego or on the UC San Diego campus. To reduce further spread of the infection beyond Wuhan City, all public transportation within Wuhan City and outbound air and rail travel was suspended as of January 22, 2020. Recently, travel in other cities near Wuhan has been restricted. This is an evolving situation, and UC San Diego Health’s Infection Prevention leadership is in contact with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and county public authorities and continues to provide ongoing clinical guidance. To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information.  If you have a fever and symptoms of pneumonia, such as cough or shortness of breath Stay home from school and work. Cover your cough. Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment. Students should call Student Health Services. If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, within the past 14 days, notify your health care provider at the time of your call. It is important to call before heading into a clinic so that your provider can be prepared for your visit. · UC San Diego Health and Student Health Services have developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff. Flu Protection With flu activity continuing to increase in San Diego, now is the time to make sure that you are protected against the flu. It’s not too late to get a flu shot, which is the best way to prevent the flu and its potentially serious complications. There is no vaccination for the coronavirus. We ask you to join us in keeping your vaccinations up to date, washing your hands often, staying hydrated, and helping us prevent the spread of infections. We will provide updates as needed; if you have questions or concerns, please reach out to your primary care provider or Student Health Services.

worldwide. Our leadership and health care experts are in continuous contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health, and the San Diego County Public Health for updated information on the outbreak, and for any changes in the protocols to screen, identify and diagnose potential cases of 2019-nCoV. If cases occur, UC San Diego will collaborate with the CDC and San Diego Public Health to prevent, isolate, and control the spread of this infection. We understand that members of the community are worried about the virus and how it may impact us. Rest assured, your health and wellbeing is our top priority. Our goal is to keep you informed and to provide a safe campus environment for all students, employees and visitors. This Q&A may provide helpful information about 2019-nCoV. Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S? No. At this time, there is no evidence of transmission to other people in close contact with the five persons in the U.S identified with 2019-nCoV. The confirmed U.S. patients had all visited the city of Wuhan, China where the virus was first identified. To repeat, to date, the virus 2019-nCoV has not been found to be spreading in the U.S. How can I protect myself? The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing, not your hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. I am a student and think I may have a respiratory virus. Can Student Health Services help me? Yes. Student Health Services has developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to identify persons who might be infected with 2019 n-CoV. Please call 858-534-3300 for guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider. You may also go to http//myStudentChart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with your Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse.” Does a student with respiratory illness need to visit Student Health to receive a note to be excused from class? The student should call Student Health Services to be evaluated. If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class. Should I wear a respiratory mask on campus? It is not necessary to wear a respiratory mask unless you have travelled from Hubei Province, China in the past 14 days AND you have symptoms of an active respiratory illness such as fever and coughing or sneezing or if you have other health reasons to wear a mask. Student Health provides masks to students being evaluated who have fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of insurance. I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me? Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200. How are our International Students being guided at this time? UC San Diego is tracking the locations of our international students and providing guidance to students who may travel to high-risk areas in China. Currently, no UC San Diego student is studying abroad in these locations. At this time, the CDC recommends travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. It also recommends that travelers practice easy health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned. Please visit the CDC website, which is updated daily, for the latest information. https//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html Pradeep K.

the dynamic developments regarding the 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Today, the United Nations’ World Health Organization declared a “global health emergency” as the number of cases has continued to expand to more than a dozen countries. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also confirmed that the coronavirus has spread between two people in the United States, which is the first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in this country. The health and safety of our UC community is our No. 1 priority. To that end, following both CDC and State Department guidance, I am directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China, while it is designated with a Warning Level 3 Travel Notice. Each campus and medical center should take immediate steps to develop a review and approval process to determine if travel to China is absolutely essential or if it can be postponed. In order to ensure the well-being and safety of those who must travel during this time, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before their expected departure and update this information as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of travelling abroad and helps keeps the University community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as the coronavirus.

UC San Diego continues to be vigilant in monitoring the progression of this outbreak and understands that members of the campus and community are concerned about its potential impacts. Francesca Torriani, MD, UC San Diego Health's Director of Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology and an Infectious Diseases specialist and Stacie San Miguel, MD, Director of Medical Services for UC San Diego Student Health Services, will provide an overview of the situation, followed by a Q&A. Webinar topics include recommendations on preventative measures and UC San Diego’s plan to identify, treat and contain any potential cases of 2019-nCoV diagnosed within the UC San Diego community. See details below for how to participate UC San Diego Novel Coronavirus Zoom Webinar Webinar  To call in US  International numbers available  For those unable to participate in the webinar, it will be archived online on Blink at In addition, this Q&A provides helpful information about 2019-nCoV  Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S.?  No. At this time, there is no evidence of transmission to other people in close contact with the five persons in the U.S. identified with 2019-nCoV. The confirmed U.S. patients had all visited the city of Wuhan, China where the virus was first identified. To repeat, to date, the 2019-nCoV virus has not been found to be spreading in the U.S.  How can I protect myself?  The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing—not your hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  I am a student and think I may have a respiratory virus. Can Student Health Services help me?  Yes. Student Health Services has developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to identify persons who might be infected with 2019-nCoV. Please callfor guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider. You may also go to and log in with your Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse.” Q. Does a student with respiratory illness need to visit Student Health to receive a note to be excused from class? A. The student should call Student Health Services to be evaluated. If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class.  Should I wear a respiratory mask on campus?  It is not necessary to wear a respiratory mask unless you have travelled from Hubei Province, China in the past 14 days AND you have symptoms of an active respiratory illness—such as fever and coughing or sneezing—or if you have other health reasons to wear a mask. Student Health provides masks to students being evaluated who have a fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of insurance.  I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me?  Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200.  How are our international students and scholars being guided at this time?  UC San Diego is evaluating the locations of our international students and scholars and providing guidance to individuals who may travel to high-risk areas in China. Currently, no UC San Diego student is studying abroad in these high-risk locations. At this time, the CDC recommends travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. It also recommends that travelers practice everyday health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned. Please visit the CDC website, which is updated daily, for the latest information. https//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html Pradeep K.

Despite the declaration by the World Health Organization of a public health emergency of international concern, it is important to note that there are no known confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in San Diego at this time. However, as the numbers of cases has continued to expand and both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State Department have warned against non-essential travel to China, the University of California has called for a temporary stop of non-essential travel to the affected region. We are developing a review and approval process to determine which travel to China is essential and if postponing is an option. We understand that members of the community are worried about the virus and how it may impact us. Rest assured, your health and wellbeing is our top priority. Our goal is to keep you informed and to provide a safe campus environment for all students, employees and visitors. Our leadership and health care experts are in continuous contact with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health for updated information on the outbreak. We are making adjustments to the protocols to screen, identify and diagnose potential cases of 2019-nCoV. If cases occur, UC San Diego will collaborate with the CDC and San Diego Public Health to prevent, isolate, and control the spread of this infection. The CDC has expanded the area of travel concern to encompass Hubei Provence and created a framework to identify and isolate patients meeting criteria for 2019-nCoV testing. The criteria is based on the highest to lowest probability of infection, ranging from those who have been in close contact with a patient with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV, to patients who are experiencing fever and cough and those who have traveled to the province of Hubei within 14 days of symptom onset. Persons who have traveled to mainland China within the past 14 days should self-monitor for symptoms of acute respiratory infection including fever and cough or other flu-like symptoms. If you have these symptoms and travel history within the past 14 days, please contact Student Health or your healthcare provider. Until you have a medical evaluation, take precautionary steps to reduce possible exposure to others by covering your cough and sneezes, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with other people. This Q&A may provide helpful information about 2019-nCoV. Q Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S? A While the number of cases in the U.S. has risen, most cases continue to be patients who contracted the virus during a visit to impacted regions in China. The first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the U.S. was recently identified in a spouse. Still, according to the CDC risk of acquiring the disease in the U.S. is low. In contrast, the influenza or flu virus is very active in the U.S. right now. According to the CDC, at least 19 million people in this country have become sickened with the flu and 25,000 have died from complications due to the flu. Conversely, there are a total of six positive coronavirus cases in the U.S., all were diagnosed early and have mild manifestations. Q How can I protect myself? A The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an acute respiratory illness.  Stay home when you are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing, not your hands.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Q I am a student and think I may have a respiratory virus. Can Student Health Services help me? A Yes. Student Health Services has developed triage screening (by phone and at front desks) and implemented additional protocols to identify persons who might be infected with 2019 n-CoV. Please call 858-534-3300 for guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider.

If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class. Q Should I wear a respiratory mask on campus? A Masks will not protect you from getting a respiratory illness, while washing your hands often and avoiding touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth, keeping a distance from people who are visibly sneezing and coughing will help decrease the risk. Student Health provides masks to students while they are being evaluated who have fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of insurance. Mask use is an effective prevention tool in the healthcare environment. Mask use by the general public has not been shown to be effective. Q I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me? A Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200. Q How are our Students and Scholars who may be travelling internationally being guided at this time? A UC San Diego is tracking the locations of our students travelling internationally and providing guidance to students who may travel to high-risk areas in China. Currently, no UC San Diego student is studying abroad in these locations. At this time, the CDC and State Department recommend travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. More importantly, the University of California Office of the President has put a hold on non-essential travel to mainland China. It also recommends that travelers practice easy health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. Q What if I already have a scheduled work trip to China? A We are currently evaluating the impact to staff and faculty who have pre-existing travel plans to China and will determine on a case-by-case basis which travel may need to be postponed. Please note, you may want to check your current flight plans as some U.S. airline carriers are canceling or limiting flights to China. As a community, UC San Diego is firmly committed to creating a culture of inclusion on our campus, a goal we continue to strive toward and from which we will not waver. Respect and dignity for allregardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability or background—are of paramount importance to our mission as an educational institution. For more information on 2019-nCoV, the campus has we have posted a webinar on Blink hosted by Francesca Torriani, MD, and Stace San Miguel, MD, explaining the coronavirus, its spread and UC San Diego's current plan of action. We will continue to post updates here https//blink.ucsd.edu/safety/resources/public-health/coronavirus.html. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned.

We strongly support our Chinese community and their families in this difficult time and hope that this outbreak can be brought to a swift conclusion. With increasing concern about global spread of the nCoV, the US State Department has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (https://bit.ly/2Op1GD4) related to travel to and from China. Under this advisory, all non-essential travel to China by U.S. Government personnel has been suspended. President Napolitano has directed that the UC community temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China. Each UC campus and medical center has been directed to develop a process to determine if travel to China is essential or can be postponed. UC San Diego’s interim policy, outlined below, has been drafted to be consistent with this policy. It is not intended to be a travel ban since UC San Diego faculty, staff and students may have legitimate reasons to travel to China for essential purposes and/or personal emergencies. OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY TRAVEL Members of the UC San Diego and UC San Diego Health faculty, staff and student communities should not travel to China for non-essential purposes. As directed by President Napolitano, UC San Diego has developed a process by which personnel who wish to travel to China on essential business may request designation of their travel as being in the “essential” category. We recognize that UC San Diego and UC San Diego Health are world-class institutions and that members of our community may be called upon to travel to China to assist in control of the nCoV outbreak or to conduct other ongoing critical activities. Those wishing to travel on official university business for essential reasons will be asked to submit to their department head a written “Request for Essential Travel Designation” to include the name and position title of the university/UC Health traveler, a detailed statement of the reason for the travel, the dates and locations of the travel, and a justification for why the travel cannot be deferred or the business conducted by electronic communications. An electronic form is available at https://aps.ucsd.edu/chinatravelpreapproval.html. The department head or dean and vice chancellor of the traveler’s unit will determine whether the travel is deemed to be essential in nature. If it is determined that the travel is not of an essential nature, the traveler can appeal to the Chancellor’s Office for a final determination. If travel is deemed essential, the traveler will register with the UC International Travel Registry at https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html before their departure date and update any deviations from the information deposited in the registry before, during and after their travel occurs. The University will provide support to the traveler according to existing university travel policies for those traveling on essential university business and who are registered in the UC International Travel Registry. Travelers must obtain “Essential Travel Designation” AND register in the UC International Travel Registry in order for the university to provide reimbursement of travel expenses and in order for the university travel program (Connexxus) to provide emergency assistance. When travelers return to the U.S., whether or not they are traveling on essential university business, they must comply with all U.S. re-entry and quarantine requirements in place before returning to the university community. PERSONAL TRAVEL UC San Diego recognizes that many members of our community have family and other close personal ties in China. This interim UC San Diego travel policy is not intended to impede travel related to family and other personal obligations. Travel of this nature is considered (as in the past) to be personal travel. It will be subject to any regulations and advisories of the U.S. government and other relevant agencies. Personal travelers will be required to comply with all U.S. re-entry and quarantine requirements in place before returning to the university community. We look forward to seeing this outbreak brought under control by the efforts of the global community, and we will continue to provide all possible support to affected members of our community.

Despite the declaration by the World Health Organization of a public health emergency of international concern, it is important to note that there are no known confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in San Diego at this time. Our leadership and health care experts are in continuous contact with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health for updated information on the outbreak. Please join us Thursday, Feb. 6 from 5 to 5:45 p.m. for the campus’ second webinar featuring UC San Diego’s health experts who will share the latest advice from these local, national and international health agencies regarding the ongoing situation with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Francesca Torriani, M.D., UC San Diego Health's Program Director of Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology and an Infectious Diseases specialist, and Stacie San Miguel, M.D., Director of Medical Services for UC San Diego Student Health Services, will share their expertise, and recommendations on preventative measures. In addition, they will relay UC San Diego’s plan to identify, treat and contain any potential cases of 2019-nCoV diagnosed within the UC San Diego community. Drs. Torriani and San Miguel will be joined by Alysson Satterlund, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs who will be a part of the question and answer section of the webinar to address student queries and concerns. All faculty, students, and staff are encouraged to participate.

TRAVEL UPDATE: With increasing concern about global spread of the nCoV, the U.S. State Department has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (https://bit.ly/2Op1GD4) related to travel to and from China. Under this advisory, all non-essential travel to China by U.S. Government personnel has been suspended. President Napolitano has directed that the UC community temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China. Each UC campus and medical center has been directed to develop a process to determine if travel to China is essential or can be postponed. UC San Diego’s interim policy is consistent with this policy and can be found at http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-2-3-3.html. It is not intended to be a travel ban since UC San Diego faculty, staff and students may have legitimate reasons to travel to China for essential purposes and/or personal emergencies. Travelers should practice easy health precautions, including avoiding close contact with people who are visibly sick, practicing excellent hand hygiene and covering coughs and sneezes. The CDC has expanded the area of travel concern to encompass mainland China and created a framework to identify and isolate patients meeting criteria for 2019-nCoV testing Patients Under Investigation (PUI). The criteria are based on the highest to lowest probability of infection, ranging from those who have been in close contact with a patient with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV and who are experiencing fever or cough to those who have traveled to China within 14 days of symptom onset and who are experiencing fever and cough or shortness of breath. Asymptomatic persons who have traveled to mainland China within the past 14 days should self-monitor for symptoms of acute respiratory infection including fever and cough or other flu-like symptoms. Any person with these symptoms and an exposure to a patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV or travel to China within the past 14 days should immediately contact their primary care provider; students should contact Student Health Services (SHS). Students with travel history within the past 14 days and with fever or cough should contact SHS (858-534-3300) for guidance and to determine if they need to be seen by a provider. Students may also go to https://mystudentchart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with their Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse”. While awaiting a medical evaluation, students should take precautionary steps to reduce possible exposure to others by covering your cough and sneezes, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with other people. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar is one of four military bases that have been chosen to house up to 1,000 people who may require quarantine for coronavirus following travel in China. About 250 individuals are expected to arrive in the next few days and be held in federal quarantine for 14 days. Medical personnel on the flights and on base will screen individuals for signs or symptoms of coronavirus. Any person developing signs or symptoms of coronavirus or with other acute medical problems will be admitted to one of four hospitals in the region. UC San Diego Health will be working with the San Diego Public Health Department to support these individuals if needed. The situation is fluid and therefore be prepared to act should there be any changes to the protocols outlined above. Q&A ABOUT 2019-nCoV: Is 2019-nCoV spreading in the U.S? While the number of cases in the U.S. has risen, most cases continue to be patients who contracted the virus during a visit to impacted regions in China. The first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the U.S. was recently identified in the spouse of a recent traveler from China who acquired the virus while in China. Still, according to the CDC risk of acquiring the disease in the U.S. is low. In contrast, the influenza or flu virus is very active in the U.S. right now. According to the CDC, at least 19 million people in this country have become sickened with the flu and 25,000 have died from complications due to the flu. How can I protect myself? The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Everyday preventive actions to reduce exposure include: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Stay home when you are sick with an acute respiratory illness. Remember, influenza is a far greater threat for death in the U.S. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough into your sleeve or clothing, not your hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Should I wear a respiratory mask. Masks will not protect you from getting a respiratory illness, while washing your hands often and avoiding touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth, keeping a distance from people who are sneezing or coughing will help decrease the risk. Mask use is an effective prevention tool in the healthcare environment, for patients with symptoms and healthcare providers. Mask use by the general public has not been shown to be effective. Q. Does a student with respiratory illness need to visit Student Health to receive a note to be excused from class? A. The student should call Student Health Services to be evaluated. If the student is advised by Student Health to avoid public areas, this guidance will serve as a “note” to excuse the student from class. I feel anxious about the news and want to talk about it. Does the university have resources for me? Yes. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200.

safeguard the health and wellness of our students, staff and faculty by carefully monitoring the global progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Our leadership and health experts are in constant contact with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health to ensure your ongoing safety at the university. Currently, UC San Diego Health is caring for three patients who were transferred from federal quarantine at MCAS Miramar. Two have tested positive for COVID-19; a third is considered a patient under investigation (PUI) who has developed symptoms that warrant further observation and testing. All three patients are doing well and all necessary measures and precautions are being taken to minimize any potential exposure. As the region’s only academic health system, UC San Diego Health specializes in the care of patients with complex illnesses, including infectious diseases more virulent than COVID-19. We thank UC San Diego Health staff for their critical role in providing care for patients and their careful leadership in educating our greater community during this time of uncertainty. We will continue to communicate with you as new information is learned. In the interim, we encourage you to visit http://coronavirus.ucsd.edu where you can find resources such as archived webinars, tips for staying well, frequently asked questions and more. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523.

developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). This week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice for South Korea. In addition, the CDC has listed other countries in both Asia and Europe where sustained transmission of COVID-19 has transpired or where the virus has spread. The health and well-being of our community remains our No. 1 priority. To that end, I think it is necessary for us to take all of the precautions necessary in this fluid situation, erring on the side of safety. Expanding on the directive I issued in late January, I am further directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice. This currently includes South Korea as well as China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Macau and Hong Kong). For the latest information on travel warnings and UC-related updates, go to ucal.us/coronavirus. In addition, UC community members who are currently traveling on University-related business in a country designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice should plan to immediately leave the area unless their UC campus or medical center deems their travel to be essential. Risk Services units at campuses and Medical Centers can help facilitate safe departures and returns to campus as needed. Again, it is of utmost importance that all faculty, staff, and students traveling abroad for University-related purposes register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry before their expected departure and ensure they update this information as changes occur before and during travel. Registration is an important step in reducing the risks of traveling abroad while keeping the UC community safe, especially in environments with heightened health risks such as COVID-19. Chancellors et al. February 26, 2020 Page 2 I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the UC employees at our campuses and medical centers for their ongoing responses, research, treatment of patients, and service to the UC community and the public at large. The safety of our faculty, staff, and students remains our highest priority, and I appreciate your immediate attention and cooperation to this matter.         410\n",

                      UC San Diego continues to be vigilant in monitoring the progression of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). While the news of the virus and its implications for the health of many around the world is concerning, please be assured that your safety and well-being are our top priority. The health risk to the general public and to San Diegans remains low. However, worldwide, the virus has been detected in a number of locations. Most recently, Iran, Italy and Japan have experienced new infections and sustained community transmission of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Department of State have issued travel advisories for these countries, in addition to the existing advisories for China and South Korea. Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing non-essential travel. As the situation continues to be fluid and additional countries become be impacted by COVID-19, the UC San Diego community is encouraged to check: The CDC website for the latest information on travel advisories as they relate to the spread of the virus at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html U.S. Department of State website for the latest information on travel advisories at: http://bit.ly/3a9n8oh A few weeks ago, President Napolitano directed the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential travel to China. Members of the UC community are now further directed to temporarily avoid all non-essential university-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning – Level 3 Travel Notice. This currently includes South Korea as well as China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Macau and Hong Kong). For information on UC San Diego’s interim travel policy, which now includes South Korea, visit: http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-2-3-3.html At this time, UC San Diego Health is no longer caring for any patients with confirmed or possible cases of COVID-19. In the event that any new patients are received, UC San Diego Health stands prepared and ready to address these changing future conditions.

Coronavirus (COVID-19), UC San Diego needs to be prepared should some students, staff, and faculty on our campus be ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months. Our UC San Diego community must collectively ensure that we can still provide our students the outstanding education they deserve. We are writing to let you know that we expect all faculty and academic administrators to take the actions outlined below, for the educational benefit of our UC San Diego students. Faculty are expected to take the following steps. If you encounter challenges, please alert your department chair or other unit leader. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, the instructor of record for each course taught at UC San Diego MUST 1. Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook in the Canvas learning management system [https://canvas.ucsd.edu]; if your course is already in Triton Ed, you may use that platform instead. This will ensure that if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are under quarantine, an accurate record of all assignment scores will be accessible, so that students can receive their course grades in a timely manner. 2. Ensure that final exam papers can be reliably collected and graded, and the course grades computed and submitted, even if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are quarantined. 3. Plan how to adjust course policies related to class attendance so as not to penalize students who become ill or are placed under quarantine. STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, the instructor of record for each course taught at UC San Diego MUST take the three steps listed above, and also: 4. Place all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, reading lists) on Canvas, so that students can access them remotely even if unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine. If the course has a separate website, provide a link to it from Canvas. You are highly encouraged to take this step for your Winter 2020 courses. STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, all faculty are ENCOURAGED to do the following to make it feasible for students to keep up with a course even if illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions prevent them from coming to campus: 5. If feasible, arrange for lecture capture/podcasting of your course. Use the Kaltura tool to create/distribute the videos/podcasts via Canvas. This ensures that the material is stored safely and is available with sufficient internet bandwidth. 6. Make those videos or podcasts available to your department, as part of an inventory other instructors can draw upon if necessary. 7. Ask your department whether previous instructors have captured lectures for your course, so you can draw upon those as necessary and appropriate. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, academic administrators (deans, chairs, directors, and provosts) are REQUIRED to take the following steps. Work with all faculty in your unit to ensure they take the steps outlined above. Make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined. Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or students who had arranged accommodation with respect to in-person. Plan to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support the academic advancement of students from abroad who cannot go home during summer 2020. This should include current students and inbound transfers from CA community colleges. Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already. Make faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed to support current courses. Arrange for key courses to undergo lecture capture in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, and beyond, so as to provide the greatest coverage in future times of need. For assistance with the items involving educational technology, please contact Educational Technology Services Services [https://edtech.ucsd.edu] or the Teaching Learning Commons [https://commons.ucsd.edu]. Thank you for taking these steps to ensure the educational resilience of our campus and to support our students’ academic success, in the face of the challenges posed by COVID-19. Pradeep K.

many around the world is concerning. At this time, the risk to the general public and to San Diegans remains low and there have been no reported cases at UC San Diego. However, we want to remind you of some standard health practices that can prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our community. These same practices also prevent the spread of the seasonal flu virus which is very active throughout the country right now. They include: 1) Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer 2) Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands 3) Avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are sick 4) Cover your cough or sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash 5) Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched There is currently no need to cancel classes or other events at UC San Diego. The campus continues to monitor the progression of the virus and coordinate with federal, state and local public health officials so that we remain fully prepared. UC San Diego has extensive and thorough emergency procedures, and we will do everything possible to ensure the health and safety of our community. As part of our planning, we are helping departments take steps to minimize disruptions to student learning and ensuring students and employees who may become ill are supported so they can stay home and recover. If you are considering travel, be sure to check the latest travel advisories at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices, which currently recommend avoiding nonessential travel to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Also keep in mind that the situation is fluid and other countries can always add or change travel restrictions, flights may be canceled, and new re-entry restrictions or quarantines could be imposed. Please be sure to provide family and friends with your itinerary and contact information before you travel. If you develop flu-like symptoms—fever, cough and difficulty breathing—please seek medical attention. Students should call Student Health Services at 858-534-3300 for guidance and to determine if you need to be seen by a provider. Students may also go to http://myStudentChart.ucsd.edu/shs/ and login with your Student AD to send a message to “Ask-a-Nurse.” Faculty and staff should call their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. If you are experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety about the virus and would like to access counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858-534-3755. If you are a campus employee, call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at 858-534-5523. If you are a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call 619-543-3200. UC San Diego will continue to keep you informed by providing the most reliable and up-to-date information possible on the new COVID-19 webpage on UC San Diego Newsroom, which can be found at https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/covid-19. Finally, we want to remind you that UC San Diego is a proud community of international scholars. We should not make assumptions about others’ perceived symptoms (a cough or fever is not uniquely associated with COVID-19) or any characteristics of their identity (the virus is now impacting diverse nations and populations around the world). We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to each other’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus. Pradeep K.

around the clock to combat the global outbreak of novel coronavirus, including within the United States. From the earliest days of the outbreak, the University of California has been on the front lines of response efforts to COVID-19, leveraging the power of UC research to inform and guide our actions and providing care for affected patients in our top-ranked hospitals. To date, three of our UC medical centers have treated six confirmed cases of COVID-19. All five of our medical centers have monitored at least 34 people under investigation (PUI). Each health center has comprehensive protocols and significant experience dealing with infectious diseases. Even as we care for patients, we are acutely mindful of our responsibilities to our employee communities, other patients, and the public at large. We must take this threat seriously, and we are. Combatting this virus and effectively caring for all patients requires skillful planning and nimbly responding to quickly-evolving circumstances. These changes may impact daily operations and the lives of faculty, staff, students, and communities across California. In the past few days alone, the number of countries and regions experiencing widespread community transmission has dramatically increased, thereby increasing the risk of travel to these locations. Given the rapidly changing conditions, and out of an abundance of caution, I am expanding my Feb. 26 directive to avoid all non-essential, University-related travel to CDC Level 2 (sustained community transmission) Travel Health Notice countries, in addition to Level 3 (widespread sustained transmission) –Travel Health Notice countries. Further, individuals on our campuses with a recent travel history from a CDC Level 3 country must self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left the Level 3 country and practice social distancing. CDC travel guidance for Level 3 countries applies to all travelers returning from a Level 3 country for any purpose, including personal travel. All those traveling Chancellors et al. March 5, 2020 Page 2 abroad for University-related purposes must register their international travel with the UC International Travel Registry. In addition, to ensure the University can rapidly respond to ongoing developments and continually updated guidance from the CDC and local, state, and federal public health authorities, I am formally tasking UC’s systemwide Emergency Operations Management Response Team (MRT) with the authority and responsibility to address crisis management policy decision-making and provide critical oversight focused on keeping our campuses and communities safe. As such, effective immediately, all decision-making authority on actions related to limiting the impacts of COVID-19 is, hereby, delegated to Rachael Nava, Chief Operating Officer for the UC Office of the President. COO Nava leads the MRT, which has been activated to implement our Management Response Plan to manage this evolving public health emergency. As President of the University of California, I will continue to closely monitor the situation and receive regular reports from COO Nava. We will continue to take as many precautions as necessary in order to protect the UC community while remaining calm, vigilant, and responsive. The Office of the President will continue to provide guidance as warranted. I appreciate your immediate attention and cooperation to implement this directive.

To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus on our campus. However, as local, national and global public health recommendations shift to include mitigation of transmission, we are proactively taking steps that will help to protect the community. Campus Status We remain in contact with the California Department of Public Health, San Diego County officials, university health officials and the UC Office of the President. Going forward, and through May 10, 2020, we strongly recommend the following guidelines for gatherings on campus and university-hosted events: Cancellation or postponement of events or meetings that are expected to have more than 100 people. If a meeting or event can be moved to an online platform, then the meeting could still occur. Cancellation or postponement of non-essential visits to campus by groups of more than 15 people. This would include, for example, campus tours and other events that bring visitors to campus. All UC San Diego-sponsored athletic events are scheduled to continue, however, events will now be “fan-less,” meaning there should be no fans at the events. (Details about the NCAA Division II men’s regional basketball tournament scheduled for March 13 through March 16 will be determined by the appropriate conferences and the NCAA.) All questions can be directed to the UC San Diego Emergency Operations Center at eoc@ucsd.edu. The EOC will direct your inquiry to the appropriate unit for response. Operational Continuity For the last week of Winter Quarter, courses are continuing to meet in person, but instructors will no longer use attendance-based points in their grading. Starting in Spring Quarter, all lecture and discussion courses will be delivered remotely. In the context of our campus, this will mainly involve offering conventional courses via online teaching and learning tools. Zoom can be used to deliver real-time online lectures, hold interactive sessions and office hours, or to pre-record short lectures. Course materials of all types can be placed on or linked to the Canvas LMS, including videos or podcasts of lectures, readings, and assignments; Canvas can also mediate tests and chat-based discussions. Laboratory and studio courses for which remote instruction is not possible will continue to meet in person, for the time being. Educational Technology Services, in collaboration with the Teaching and Learning Commons has developed a resource page where faculty can access tools, support and guidance for remote delivery of course materials or instruction. Questions can be directed to edtech@ucsd.edu. Comprehensive information on educational continuity at UC San Diego is available at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html Specific steps that faculty, chairs/directors/provosts, and deans are expected to take to ensure educational continuity are discussed at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/campusrequirements.html An FAQ site addressing issues of interest to faculty is at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html Housing and Dining services will continue normal operations. Travel Considerations All students, faculty and staff should consider whether any mode of personal travel is necessary. We also encourage the campus community to seek alternatives to business-related travel such as virtual meetings or conference calls. Additionally, given the rapidly changing conditions of the global outbreak, University of California President Janet Napolitano issued a directive (https://tinyurl.com/trrhjqd) for all members of the UC community. Faculty, staff and students are instructed to avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be of high risk for widespread and sustained community transmission of the virus. This would be countries that have COVID-19 Level 3 Travel Health Notices – China, Iran, Italy and South Korea - and COVID-19 Level 2 Travel Health Notices, which currently includes Japan. To view UC San Diego’s interim policy, visit https://aps.ucsd.edu/chinatravelpreapproval.html. If you do need to travel on university business, be sure to use Connexxus https://blink.ucsd.edu/travel/booking/connexxus/. If you do not use Connexxus, be sure to register your trip with UC Away. Learn more at https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html. Health and Wellness We understand that members of the campus community are worried about the virus and may be experiencing heightened feelings of anxiety. If you would like counseling services, there are resources available. If you are a student, please contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPs) at (858) 534-3755. If you’re a campus employee, contact the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program at (858) 534-5523. If you’re a UC San Diego Health employee, please contact your Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. As a reminder, we recommend observing these simple tips to help stay well: Always wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough. Clean and disinfect surfaces often. If you are sick, stay home and do not travel. Call ahead before visiting your doctor or the Student Health Center to arrange a time to be seen. Finally, we want to remind you that UC San Diego is a proud community of international scholars. We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to each other’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus. Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UC San Diego at the COVID-19 webpage at http://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. We will continue make regular updates and provide details about modified campus operations as new information is available. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor Elizabeth H.

https://go.ucsd.edu/2U2yPXg) about campus operations during the balance of Winter Quarter. While there have been no confirmed cases of Coronavirus on the UC San Diego campus, our approach is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty and staff; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in California and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching and research. All measures are in line with guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health. The campus will remain open. We are taking progressive measures to increase social distance -- that is, to enable people to safely continue with their studies and work while minimizing close face-to-face interactions. This includes cutting down the size, frequency and density of in-person meetings and greater use of virtual interaction tools. Effective immediately for Winter Quarter: Week 10 classes are continuing as scheduled. Awarding points for student attendance in class, whether for regular or extra credit, must cease as of week 10. There will be NO in-person, on-campus, final exams during the Winter Quarter 2020 finals week. Each instructor of record must use either an online final exam, a take-home final exam or an exam-equivalent alternative assessment. The instructor will determine the mode for their final exam that best serves the academic needs of their class. Instructors should maintain compatibility with accommodations previously approved by OSD. In-depth information for students, faculty and staff is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/2U2yPXg Classrooms and libraries will remain open during finals week, for use in studying or working on exams. Decisions regarding operations, including classes, housing and financial aid, will be announced soon, and are being made in conjunction with Academic Senate, Associated Students and Graduate Student Association leadership.

      "18  13-Mar-20  Diego    CA  Conducting Research Activities During the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak (COVID-19) PLEASE SHARE WITH ALL OF YOUR PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS AND RESEARCH GROUP LEADS UC San Diego continues to safeguard the health and wellness of our students, staff and faculty by carefully monitoring the global progression of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Our leadership and health experts are in constant contact with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the California Department of Public Health, and San Diego County Public Health Services to ensure the ongoing safety of our campus community. Details about prevention and various campus updates are available on the campus website at: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/. In order to address concerns specific to research about the impact of the coronavirus, we will be regularly updating our website (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/COVID-19-research.html) with the most recent information both from UC San Diego and from external agencies. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed there, please do not hesitate to let me know. If emergency procedures are implemented, researchers and principal investigators on campus may face unique circumstances regarding their work. It is important to consider how these procedures may impact your research, your staff and your contractual obligations to any funding you receive. All available information indicates that you can and should make several assumptions as you plan for ensuring the continuity of your research. Specifically, you should assume that: Essential research infrastructure, such as power and telecommunications, will be maintained. UC San Diego teams that support research, including Sponsored Program Offices, Animal Care Program, Human Research Protections Program, and Research Compliance and Integrity, will continue to support your research. The Animal Care Program and Office of Environment, Health, and Safety will continue their essential research support functions. However: Some lower priority services from the Animal Care Program and Office of Environment, Health and Safety may need to be curtailed. A significant percentage of your laboratory workforce may not be able to come to work, either because they are ill, or for other reasons, such as school closures, telecommuting recommendations, etc. Orders for critical supplies may be delayed. Some core facilities and other fee-for-service resources may not be available. CONSIDERATIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF RESEARCH LIMITED ACCESS TO CAMPUS Currently there are no plans to restrict access to university research spaces; however, every research group should plan ahead in the event that campus access is restricted. In the event of such restrictions, there will be a need for designated personnel to carry out specific, essential duties. These include those functions focused on support for: Human health, welfare and safety Research animals, specimens, and research equipment including laboratory procedures and processes that require regular personnel attention Information technology services or security Building or property security, safety, and integrity Critical infrastructure (e.g., power, water, heat, roads) Critical business, contractual, or legal obligations including employee payroll In each research unit, specific personnel responsible for these functions should be designated as part of your business continuity plan. If you are unsure of who in your research project should be designated, work with your department administrator or an equivalent administrator to identify such personnel. In order to ensure continuity of research operations, we ask that you identify resources, vendors or other suppliers that are required to continue research during an emergency situation. We recommend that you order supplies well in advance of anticipated need so that your research is less subject to disruptions in the supply chain. WORKING REMOTELY Principal investigators and research group leads should discuss alternate workflows now to be prepared in the event that some personnel are unable to come to work. Such advanced planning will make future decisions straightforward and minimize disruption to research activities. Examples of research work that can be done remotely include data analysis; literature reviews; writing proposals, reviews, or research papers; writing the background sections of theses; computational work; and meetings and discussions. For this reason, you might consider prioritizing work at this time that can only be carried out in your research facility and holding off on work amenable to remote support. Stockpiling results and data now that could be analyzed remotely in the future is a potential option that might create future flexibility. If you are carrying out a long-term experiment and if it is feasible to freeze samples at specific steps, you might consider doing this more often. If you are propagating cell lines or microorganisms that you have not yet frozen or otherwise preserved, it would be a good practice to do so before any research disruptions occur. Principal investigators and research group leaders should consult guidance available from Human Resources on remote working arrangements for all personnel, including graduate students, postdocs and others: https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/. Additional information can be found at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/. All personnel involved in research projects should ensure that they have access to equipment and information they need to carry out work remotely, including well-established VPN access. https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/ Things to consider might include access to literature, to existing datasets and research-related files, and to meeting/communications software. Tools like Google, Zoom or Slack can be leveraged, along with Canvas https://edtech.ucsd.edu/faculty/index.html, our learning management system and Virtual Advising Center. Principal investigators should prepare to carry out meetings remotely. If you are unsure about whether you have access to such tools or how to use them, it is wise to test them now. Resources are available through Educational Technology Services https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/. ANIMAL RESEARCH If your lab uses animals in its research, please consider continuity of care very carefully. While the team at the Animal Care Program has plans in place to ensure continuity of care, please be sure to communicate with them about animal care needs in the event of campus closure. They can be reached at 858-534-6064, or email Acp-directors-office@ucsd.edu. We ask that you work with ACP staff to identify resources, vendors or other suppliers that are required to continue research or care of animals during an emergency situation. RESEARCH WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS UC San Diego is committed to the health and safety of our research participants and our research clinical and administrative teams and values clinical research activities. To ensure safety of staff, research participants and research team members, all researchers performing human subject research will be required to align with the UC San Diego Health System plan to screen research participants for COVID-19 risk and implement precautions and policies. Tools to help you do so, including a script for screening participants by phone and in person, as well as other guidelines, will be made available and regularly updated at https://irb.ucsd.edu. EXTERNAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION In general, we expect that all Sponsored Program Offices will be able to submit proposals as usual, even if personnel are working remotely. We recommend working with your Fund Managers and staff to ensure that proposal materials are routed as early as possible to your SPO, so that time is made for unanticipated delays that might be caused by the absence of staff impacted by COVID-19. Our experience is that federal agencies are very flexible about deadlines under times of major emergencies. However, if agencies are officially closed, proposals will most likely remain in a queue, pending resumption of agency operations — as has been the case during federal budget-related shutdowns. Information will be posted on the ORA and OCGA websites https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/, if necessary. If you have any questions about COVID-19's potential impact on an existing research project, project-related travel, or field work, please contact your Contract and Grant Officer. Guidance from federal agencies has started to be distributed, including a Dear Colleague Letter from NSF encouraging researchers to be proactive in reaching out to their program officers if a research project will be impacted by COVID-19. TRAVEL President Napolitano has directed the UC community to temporarily halt all non-essential travel to CDC Level 2 and 3 countries. You can access the current list of countries where non-essential travel is restricted on the Academic Personnel Services website https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/preapprovalCDCLevel3travel.html along with information about pre-approvals and registration requirements.

IMPORTANT Information We continue to closely monitor the ongoing Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) situation. The health and well-being of our students, staff and faculty remains our number one priority. The University remains open and operational, with the understanding that we are making some adjustments to normal activities in order to increase social distancing in the workplace, in keeping with current public health directives and guidance. As appropriate for the type of work performed and pending supervisor approval, employees may have the option to work remotely for a temporary period as we continue to assess guidance regarding the COVID-19 situation. As a reminder, our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be expected to report to work at their usual work location. Use of Accrued Leave and Paid Administrative Leave For specific guidance on use of accrued leave and paid administrative leave please refer to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Staff at UC San Diego Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Staff at UC San Diego webpage (https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/) or for Academic Personnel (https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html). For assistance in applying the guidance to specific situations, please consult with Human Resources (employeerelations@ucsd.edu), your VC HR contacts or Unit HR personnel. Respect and Compassion UC San Diego is a proud community of diverse scholars, staff and students. We should not make assumptions about others’ perceived symptoms (a cough or fever is not uniquely associated with COVID-19) or any characteristics of their identity (the virus is now impacting nations and populations around the world). We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to each other’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy make a positive difference on our campus. Moving Forward We appreciate the challenges arising from these significant operational changes and thank you in advance for your cooperation.

prioritize the health and wellness of our community members amid the national health emergency associated with novel Coronavirus. The campus remains open to fulfill the needs of our educational and research missions, but we are taking steps to maximize social distance by minimizing face-to-face interactions. We understand that students have different circumstances, and our goal is to provide as much information as possible to inform rational choices. To that end, in keeping with current public health directives and guidance, the following actions will be taken for the Spring Quarter. ENROLLMENT AND INSTRUCTION Instruction for the entirety of the Spring Quarter will be delivered remotely; more details can be found at https://go.ucsd.edu/2vj9RdW Residence halls, dining facilities, academic buildings, recreation facilities, and so forth will remain open and available for student needs and for the essential work of our community. We realize this is a difficult and unexpected situation, and we want students and their families to make the best decision on where to live during the Spring Quarter. If enrolled, students will have to make a choice on where to live. To assist in making that decision, we offer information, including impact on financial aid computation, for consideration at this site: https://go.ucsd.edu/2QdKMII International students may face different circumstances depending upon their country of origin. Information is available at this site: https://ispo.ucsd.edu/news/coronavirusinfo.html Decisions regarding commencement exercises will be determined at a later date. HOUSING UC San Diego on-campus housing communities will remain open and operational for Spring Quarter. Housing, Dining and Hospitality (HDH) and Residential Life will continue to support students who choose to reside on campus. Undergraduate and graduate residents who choose to complete their academic quarter remotely and would like to move out of campus housing should do so by March 29. More information about opting out of your contract can be found at this link: https://hdhhome.ucsd.edu/hdh-covid-19-faq.html TUITION & FEES Consistent with guidance from the UC Office of the President, for all enrolled students, tuition and fees remain unchanged as the campus remains operational. HEALTH AND WELLNESS Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms associated with the virus, chiefly a cough, fever and shortness of breath, should contact their healthcare provider. If you choose to go to an urgent care center or emergency department, call ahead and let them know you are coming. A key component of reducing the spread of the virus is the isolation of individuals known to be infected with the virus as well as those who are awaiting test results. The campus is committed to providing as much support as we can to our resident students. If Student Health Services determines that a student meets criteria for isolation, units on campus have been identified that will safely provide the necessary isolation needs as well as nutrition and other support services. There are, however, only a limited number of these units, and it is possible that widespread illness could overwhelm those resources, so students should bear that risk in mind when assessing their housing options.

In addition, when updates are posted, we will distribute a text advisory via Triton Alerts. You may sign up for the text advisories at https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/campus-safety/triton-alert.html Thank you to all of the faculty, staff and students who have been working together to address this unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation.

Diego Health have tested positive for novel coronavirus, COVID-19, because of exposure and infection in the community. UC San Diego Health has launched an extensive effort to identify any patients or health system colleagues who may have been in recent contact with either of the affiliates. UC San Diego continues to follow all public health directives and protocols and is working closely with the San Diego County Public Health Department, San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health. A key component of reducing the spread of the virus is the isolation of individuals known to be infected with the virus as well as those who are awaiting test results. Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms associated with the virus, chiefly a cough, fever and shortness of breath, should contact their healthcare provider. If you choose to go to an urgent care center or emergency department, call ahead and let them know you are coming. Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UC San Diego at the COVID-19 webpage at http://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. See also http://ucsd.edu, and https://ucsd.edu/about/emergency.html. We will continue make regular updates and provide details about modified campus operations as new information is available.

                      The emergence of novel coronavirus and COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for communities all over. We want to commend our Triton community for thoughtfully exercising flexibility and resilience during this rapidly evolving situation. As a university, we understand the challenges we face in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distance on our campus. HOUSING In order to lower the density on campus, we are strongly urging students who can safely leave to do so as soon as feasible, but no later than March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing. Students should consider living on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who notify Housing, Dining & Hospitality of their intention to move out and turn in their keys before March 29 will receive a full refund for Spring Quarter housing costs. Information can be found on the Housing, Dining & Hospitality site (http://hdh.ucsd.edu). SPRING QUARTER INSTRUCTION UPDATE Spring Quarter instruction will commence on March 30, as originally scheduled. To reduce anxiety and demonstrate compassion for our students, we strongly recommend that faculty consider the following for the first week of instruction: (a) taking measures to help students familiarize themselves with the remote instruction tools for the course, (b) making review and introductory material available via Canvas so students joining the course late can catch up, and (c) refraining from having assignments or assessments due that week. To further enhance opportunities for social distancing, ALL UC San Diego courses will be offered remotely for the entire Spring Quarter, including laboratories, studio classes, small group discussions and seminars. There will be no exceptions. Students will participate in all courses remotely, regardless of where they reside. We have a small window to take proactive steps to protect our community, and we are asking everyone to do their best and to be community-minded. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. During this time of uncertainty, we ask that students, faculty and staff remain calm, respect one another and commit to our overall well-being.

The World Health Organization has declared that the disease is a pandemic. Declarations of Emergency have been issued by the President of the United States, the Governor of California, and many California counties and other local jurisdictions, including many of the jurisdictions where the University of California maintains campuses or other significant operations. In the United States, where the virus was detected only weeks ago, several thousand people have already been stricken ill by the disease. The disease is spreading rapidly in our communities and, accordingly, protecting the capacity of our health care systems is imperative. Many governmental offices, school districts and universities, and private businesses have suspended inperson operations and/or directed employees t   work remotely in an effort t   slow the spread of the disease, and t   conserve our limited health resources. The Governor of California has called for bars, wineries and nightclubs t   temporarily cease operation and for restaurants t   reduce capacity by 50% in order t   allow for social distancing. Health officials have placed a limit on mass gatherings and have restricted and/or advised against all travel except that which is deemed essential. The University of California holds as its highest priority the health, safety and wellbeing of its students, faculty, clinicians, administrators and employees, and all other members of its communities. The University holds as an additional priority the effective functioning of its health systems, which will serve as critical state assets in the state’s response t   the COVID  19 pandemic, and must be able to maintain sufficient staffing resources t   meet operational needs. As President of the University, I have concluded that critical steps must be taken t   limit the exposure of members of our community t   the disease within our community, t   care for those wh   have fallen ill or otherwise been exposed, and t   assure the continued functioning of critical operations, including most particularly the health systems that we will rely on t   meet the challenge posed by COVID  19. Executive Order WHEREFORE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I DECLARE: On the authority vested in me by Bylaw 30, Bylaw 22.1, Regents Policy 1500 and Standing Order 100.4(ee), and based on the foregoing circumstances, I hereby issue the following order, t   be effective for the period March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and direct the following: On March 9, 2020, the University authorized a grant of up t   14 days of paid administrative leave for employees unable t   work for COVID  19 related reasons. In order t   address the extraordinary demands placed on our employees in seeking and providing health care for COVID  19, and otherwise responding t   this pandemic, that guidance shall be modified as follows: All employees shall be eligible t   receive a one  time allotment of up t   128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject t   the following conditions All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire; The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health; The number of hours for employees wh   work less than full  time shall be prorated according t   the percent of the appointment; Exempt employees wh   d   not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the onetime allotment of the paid administrative leave. The paid administrative leave hours may only be used for the following purposes: When an employee is unable t   work due t   the employee’s own COVID  19 related illness or that of a family member; When an employee is unable t   work because the employee has been directed not t   come t   the worksite for COVID  19  related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID  19  related remote  work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely; When an employee is unable t   work because a COVID  19  related school or daycare closure requires the employee t   be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee t   work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.

In keeping with that responsibility, ALL on-site research will be modified to be in compliance with University of California San Diego policies on safety and social distancing during the COVID-19 emergency. This is NOT a complete shut-down of research activity, but a requirement that every effort be made to transition the work of research staff off-site minimizing on-site efforts to only critical activities. Our goal is to reduce the density of people in research laboratories, on campus, and in the community in general. Social distancing must continue to at least meet the levels recommended by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the CA Department of Public Health (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx). When possible, studies should be modified to enable virtual assessments and distance monitoring using video communication (Zoom https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/zoom/index.html or other technologies), electronic data capture, or telephone. In order to maintain continuity of research during this time, research personnel working remotely must work at a private off-campus location with secure internet services. Note that federal agencies are making every effort to respond flexibly to the challenges created by this emergency. The most recent information and guidance from federal agencies and other funders is available at https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/. We recognize that some research requires staff on-site, even during this emergency. To guide our identification of that research requiring sustained on-site activity during the COVID-19 emergency period, we have identified two key principles: 1. SAFETY: To the extent possible, all research activity that is critical to the safety and well-being of the human participants or animal subjects shall continue during the crisis. 2. ETHICS: On-site research staff reductions must not produce or increase the risk of ethical violations during the COVID-19 emergency period. CRITERIA FOR EXCEPTION TO ON-SITE STAFF REDUCTIONS: 1. Safety or well-being of the human participant (e.g., clinical trial with therapeutic intent where withdrawal of therapy would adversely affect the participant or invalidate subsequent data analysis) or animal subject would be jeopardized with suspension. 2. Study is near completion, and unable to be completed with reductions in staff (e.g., finishing research project requires very limited time prior to on-site staffing reduction). 3. Reduction of on-site staff would seriously jeopardize the scientific value of the entire project (e.g., loss of subjects in longitudinal study, missing measurement of rare events, or long-term studies that cannot be suspended without restarting the study). 4. Reduction of on-site staff would pose an ethical violation of research standards. 5. On-site staff are required for collection or maintenance of critical materials that cannot be replaced (e.g., cell lines and valuable biosamples such as surgical specimens) or research equipment or resources. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY all research programs or teams must develop a safety plan to substantially reduce on-site staff and minimize exposure of COVID-19 for those few staff remaining on campus. ALL ON-SITE STAFF REDUCTION PLANS FOR RESEARCH PROGRAMS MUST BE COMPLETED, SUBMITTED, REVIEWED, APPROVED AND FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED BELOW BY 5:00PM WEDNESDAY MARCH 18, 2020. PROCESS: Each Unit (Researcher, research team or center) running a project, program of research or core research facility will be required to: 1. Conduct the decision-making process to reduce on-site staff and maintain critical research functions (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html). 2. Complete the critical items form for questions relevant to their type of research or setting (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html). 3. Faculty requesting to maintain on-site research staff should develop a plan that: a. Minimizes the number of personnel who will work on-site (e.g., 1-2 core staff or <15% of staff normally in a given space); b. Minimizes the person-to-person contact for personnel working on-site, (e.g., through social distancing or flexible/staggered work schedules) c. Has been discussed with lab members to assure feasibility and rapid enactment; d. Ensures that shared and open research space must collectively adhere to the UC San Diego sanitation and social distancing policies; e. Incorporates where possible a “buddy-system” whereby essential research personnel working on-site during evening hours are accompanied by another essential personnel, while maintaining social distancing principles; f. For animal research, identifies a single person to carry on research activities in each room, in consultation with ACP; g. Includes a process to rapidly modify plans if campus requirements or personnel availability change. 4. Download forms available at (https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19-forms.html) and submit completed forms to their Chair and Dean (Division Leader and Department Chair in Health Sciences, Division Chair and Director in SIO). Faculty appointed in more than one department should submit the completed forms to all chairs of their departments and cognizant deans to which they are appointed for review. Plans will be made available on-line to ensure that notification of any modifications will be available in real time. Faculty and centers whose research space is outside their department must also submit the electronic form to the Dean in charge the space in which their study/ program resides. Researchers in ORUs submit to the ORU Director and the cognizant VC. Exception determinations will be made by Chairs or division leaders in consultation with Deans and (as needed) the Animal Care Program (ACP), Human Research Protections Program (HRPP), Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S), and other subject matter experts. Senior administrators may choose to rely on an advisory group of senior faculty when making and documenting approval of exception decisions. An independent advisory group to the VCR will be available should this process not result in consensus. We appreciate that the effort to reduce on-site research activity is significant, challenging, and unsettling as is the COVID-19 emergency. The entire Research Affairs and EH&S teams are ready to offer assistance in meeting these requirements and timelines. Sandra A. Brown, PhD Vice Chancellor for Research         938\n",

                        Dear Colleagues: The Committee on Academic Personnel (CAP) recognizes that UC San Diego faculty are currently facing a precarious and unprecedented moment with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and campus efforts to prevent a viral spread. As a result, research productivity, teaching, and other scholarly activities are likely to be impacted. Faculty who are teaching in the Spring Quarter must adapt their courses to remote teaching. Presentations and attendance at scholarly meetings and invited talks have been cancelled or postponed, and research efforts have been curtailed to minimize staff exposures. Community outreach and other service activities have been disrupted by travel restrictions and social distancing measures. Additionally, many faculty members must care for their children and elderly family members due to the closing of daycares, public schools and other care facilities. The overall stress and uncertainty of the situation will undoubtedly affect all domains of academic endeavor. Please be assured that future CAPs will account for these challenges in its review of academic files covering the time period impacted by the virus (where the length of time remains uncertain). We encourage academic units to begin to employ methods other than student evaluations to assess teaching effectiveness, which can be gleaned from the Holistic Teaching Workgroup Report recommendations: https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/387335/holistic-teaching-evaluation-workgroup-report-8-28-19.pdf or https://senate.ucsd.edu/ (see Issues Under Review). In order to fully document the obstacles encountered in academic progress, CAP strongly encourages faculty to explain any negative impacts in teaching, research or service during this time period in their self-statements. We respectfully request that these self-statements be included in the materials forwarded to CAP for review, so that CAP members may incorporate the consequences of the rapid transitions and events into their academic judgement. CAP encourages other reviewers to also take these considerations into account in their assessments of academic files.

                                   As we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing social distancing, we request that all employees currently receiving a paper paycheck go to AYSO and sign up for Direct Deposit today. Not only is this a fast, convenient and secure manner in which to receive pay, it is the only way to ensure that employees receiving and distributing paper paychecks are not put at risk. Instructions to enroll in direct deposit can be located on Blink at: https://blink.ucsd.edu/finance/payroll/processes/enroll.html Please do this as soon as possible. The fast moving situation will require the Payroll office to institute changes in the distribution of paper paychecks to employees. This will include scheduled check pick-up at designated locations and check delivery via the U.S. Postal service to employee home address, but in this rapidly evolving context, we can no longer guarantee the timely distribution of paper checks. During these times of extraordinary challenges, we are grateful for your dedication to UC San Diego and to each other. For those of you still receiving a paper check, please help us in distributing your pay to you faster and in reducing the community spread of COVID-19 by enrolling in Direct Deposit now.

continually evolving public health crisis for our region, the nation and the world. The emergence of novel coronavirus is presenting unprecedented challenges for higher education and health systems everywhere. Campus leaders and hard-working staff at all levels across UC San Diego have spent many hours thinking through the complex issues presented by this quickly changing situation. I commend the entire community for thoughtfully demonstrating flexibility and resilience during this time, and I appreciate everyone’s cooperation in implementing new guidelines efficiently and effectively. We will continue to address new issues as they emerge. CRITICAL FUNCTIONS STAFFING UC San Diego is committed to ensuring access to services for those who need them. Many of these services have shifted to online environments. But some critical functions cannot be offered remotely, including housing, dining, health services, and critical operations such as UC San Diego’s medical centers, our police department, facilities, custodial, supply chain, information systems and technology, and maintenance of critical research specimens. Communications containing safety protocols and guidelines for employees remaining on campus for critical functions have been circulated by department supervisors. Virtual training meetings for supervisors of these employees and front line employees are being conducted to ensure work processes are altered to adhere to social distancing guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html. We are working diligently to ensure remaining staff have the information and resources required to help keep them safe and healthy while they complete their work. To all critical functions staff and emergency operations employees, THANK YOU for your continued dedication and hard work. We appreciate your efforts and resolve. REDUCING CAMPUS POPULATION DENSITY We also appreciate the challenges presented as we follow public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. The health and safety of our community is the first priority, and I want to make sure we are doing all we can to ensure maximum social distancing. In order to lower the population density on campus, we are requiring employees who can work remotely to do so, and we are urging students who can safely leave and live off campus to do so as soon as possible. These actions allow the remaining critical functions staff and the students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing. For the latest information, campus employees should visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19 and students should visit https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html. Updated guidelines from the CDC strongly recommend the cancellation or postponement of events or meetings that are expected to have more than 10 people. Meetings or events with more than 10 participants should be moved to an online platform whenever possible. Technology tools for remote meetings are available at https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/remote-work/index.html. STRESS MANAGEMENT The changing nature of this crisis is stressful and anxieties are high. Counseling services and resources are available. Students can call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755. Campus employees can call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at (858) 534-5523. UC San Diego Health employees can contact the Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. In addition, UC San Diego’s Center for Mindfulness and the T. Denny Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion have joined forces with the Compassion Institute to provide daily streams and recordings of mindfulness and compassion sessions, offering resources and online support. The stream is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/3b21Aua. We are all in this together. During this time of uncertainty, we ask that students, faculty and staff continue to adhere to our Principles of Community, as described at https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html. UC San Diego is a diverse community of students, staff, scholars, faculty and researchers from around the world. We thrive when we respect one another and stay committed to one another’s well-being. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor         659\n",

have reported widely on a shortage of critical supplies and equipment that health care providers and first responders require during the COVID-19 emergency. UC San Diego calls upon all researchers and relevant facilities to come together to respond and reduce this shortage in San Diego by making specific otherwise unused equipment and materials available to the UC San Diego Health System. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT is critically important, specifically: Medical-grade Procedure and surgical masks, surgical and isolation/protective gowns, arm sleeves, goggles, eye shields and face shields. To send supplies to UC San Diego Health, contact Robbie Jacob with UC San Diego Logistics at gjacob@ucsd.edu to request pick-up from your location. Please note supply type and quantity, as well as location, in your email. Please create an inventory of all items provided, and track all costs if appropriate. This will enable reimbursements and facilitate requests for supplements to grants. Thank you in advance for your invaluable and time sensitive contributions as we all pull together in response to the current crisis! Elizabeth H. Simmons Executive Vice Chancellor Sandra A.

      "29  20-Mar-20  Diego    CA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As of midnight last night, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered all California residents to stay home until further notice, to limit the spread of COVID-19. Educational institutions such as UC San Diego are subject to these orders but are considered essential businesses. Anticipating this mandate, UC San Diego already took steps to suspend all on-campus operations with the exception of those that are deemed critical functions that cannot be conducted remotely. Below is a summary of certain operations determined to be critical for purposes of complying with the governor’s mandate, including those that will continue on campus at this time: 1. Health care services and corresponding support. UC San Diego hospitals and clinics will remain open and fully operational; more information is available on UC San Diego Health’s website at https://health.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx. 2. Student housing and dining services. 3. Classroom and laboratory instruction for remote learning will continue through the end of spring quarter. Deans and chairs will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed. 4. Enrollment management services critical to securing our fall 2020 entering class. The AVC for Enrollment Management will determine what on-campus essential support may be needed. 5. Animal care or animal research designated as critical, and research laboratory safety. 6. Research approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. 7. Emergency Operations Center, UC San Diego Police Department, Student Health Services, and Environment Health and Safety. 8. Facilities, building systems, and custodial services will continue to operate at reduced levels, but surfaces in common areas will continue to be sanitized regularly. 9. Supply chain and logistics. 10. IT services associated with onsite support of campus IT infrastructure and remote learning. 11. Human resources, finance, and the Faculty Staff Assistance Program will continue, but operate remotely. 12. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Central Office remains open 24/7. All services are offered via telehealth. To make an appointment, please call CAPS at (858) 534-3755. For urgent matters, in-person evaluations are available; please call before arrival. Students continuing care may contact their provider via MyChart. THE ABOVE IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. Further information regarding the status of essential administrative services will be distributed separately. In an effort to help guide you through the weeks and possibly months ahead, below is a summary of decisions from our administration. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures. EMPLOYEES OF UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM THE RESTRICTIONS BELOW WHEN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. The current UC San Diego directives instruct that you should: CEASE ALL IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION. Remote teaching and learning will continue through the end of spring quarter without exceptions. Instructors and students should become familiar with academic continuity tools and instructors may join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning. Instructors should visit https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources and https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html for more information. Students should visit https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html for all student resources. ONLY STAY IN STUDENT HOUSING IF YOU NEED IT. The statewide stay-at-home mandate currently does not prevent students from moving out of campus housing to return to their permanent residence. As shared earlier, students who choose to move out of UC San Diego housing can obtain prorated relief from their housing contracts. More information about opting out of your contract can be found at https://hdhhome.ucsd.edu/hdh-covid-19-faq.html. Our first priority is health and safety. We are following all public health protocols. As a public institution—and one with capacity—we have the ability and obligation to serve all members of our community in an emergency and to that end, the state of California is requesting UC San Diego be able to house community residents in an on-campus location. In this event, we will ensure all health and safety guidelines including social distancing are followed. ONLY COME TO WORK IF YOUR SUPERVISOR HAS TOLD YOU TO DO SO TO FULFILL A CRITICAL FUNCTION. You are allowed to come to work if you are supporting a critical operation on campus. If you do not think that you are supporting a critical function, but you are expected to report to work anyway, you can contact your department’s human resources representative to confirm whether your work is essential. REGULARLY VISIT UC SAN DIEGO’S COVID-19 WEBPAGE AT https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. REGISTER FOR THE TRITON ALERT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AT https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/campus-safety/triton-alert.html. IF NEEDED, CONNECT WITH STRESS MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. The changing nature of this crisis is stressful and anxieties are high. Counseling services and resources are available. Students can call Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755. Campus employees can call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) at (858) 534-5523. UC San Diego Health employees can contact the Employee Assistance Program provider aligned with your medical coverage or call (619) 543-3200. You should not do the following: DO NOT HOST ANY IN-PERSON EVENTS OR GATHERINGS OF ANY SIZE THROUGH THE END OF SPRING QUARTER. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU ARE SICK. Students living on or off campus may contact the Student Health Services at (858) 534-3300. Faculty and staff who are sick should contact their health care providers. Please always call ahead before arriving. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU ARE ON APPROVED ADMINISTRATIVE OR OTHER APPROVED LEAVE. DO NOT COME TO WORK IF YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WORK REMOTELY. Some personnel assigned to critical functions that need to be conducted on campus will need to continue to work on campus, and leadership is working with supervisors to define and identify these roles and personnel. Only these personnel will continue to work on campus. Note that students, including graduate students, cannot be mandated to serve critical functions requiring on-campus work. We expect that supervisors will work with their staff to update business continuity plans. If employees, including student employees, are not required to work on campus, but cannot work from home due to the nature of their jobs, the UC Office of the President has developed expanded leave policies and employees should consult with their supervisors about use of these policies. Information is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/33xt48y. DO NOT COME TO WORK TO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH, *EXCEPT* TO ENGAGE IN THAT CRITICAL RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL AND APPROVED. Essential experiments and essential research personnel may continue, but only with the approval of designated leadership within the Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR). The Office of Research Affairs is issuing more specific guidelines for on-campus research, off-campus research and clinical research activities, which will be distributed separately. No research equipment or supplies may be removed from campus without the authorization of the Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR). DO NOT COME TO WORK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER INTERNET CONNECTIONS OR FEWER DISTRACTIONS, *EXCEPT* FOR CLASSROOM OR LABORATORY INSTRUCTION FOR REMOTE TEACHING. We understand that it may be harder for some employees to conduct work from home. UC San Diego has procured equipment and portable internet hotspots to help faculty and staff work from home. Faculty and staff can address their needs with supervisors or department chairs. DO NOT COME TO WORK TO RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM YOUR OFFICE OR VISIT COLLEAGUES REQUIRED TO BE ON CAMPUS AFTER FRIDAY, MARCH 20 AT 11:59 P.M. Only come to campus if you have permission from your supervisor. QUESTIONS: All questions can be directed to the UC San Diego Emergency Operations Center at eoc@ucsd.edu. The EOC will direct your inquiry to the appropriate unit for response. These are unprecedented times filled with great anxiety. Please keep this in mind when communicating with one another. We ask that students, faculty and staff remain calm, respect and support one another, commit to our overall well-being, and continue to adhere to our Principles of Community as described at https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone.

                                          As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, many federal agencies are issuing funding opportunities specifically related to the pandemic. A regularly updated listing of these opportunities is available at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/COVID-19-research-ops.html. In addition, there have been requests from the Governor’s office and the UC Office of the President to outline areas in which the University of California research community can contribute to the control of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak. We are compiling a list of researchers who have either begun or have an interest in refocusing your efforts in this direction. This will facilitate our ability to direct research funding opportunities to investigators with relevant interests and which we can present to federal and state agencies as they reach out to UC San Diego for advice about research priorities. To see our current listing of those investigators go to https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/COVID-19-research-ops.html. This webpage will serve several functions: 1) it will allow the university as well as funding agencies to easily find and contact researchers whose work may be relevant to COVID-19; 2) it will allow researchers to find other researchers with whom to collaborate; 3) it will provide links to new rapid funding announcements for studies related the COVID-19 pandemic. If you would like your name and COVID-related research interests added to the UC San Diego list of COVID-19 research interests, please send your name, department and title of relevant research to Michelle Franklin at m1franklin@ucsd.edu. Remember, relevant research can include a diverse range of subjects such as behavioral responses to pandemics, economic implications and mental health. As a reminder, please keep close track of all expenses related to COVID-19, including remote work set-ups, necessary supplies and lost labor hours. This will expedite any reimbursements via supplements that will be available from the federal government.

The Senate encourages instructors and instructional assistants to make clear that students should consult with their department and college advisors and financial aid advisors about their individual circumstances prior to any final election for their grading options or course schedule. The Academic Senate’s Educational Policy Committee (EPC) and Senate Council do not support approving any blanket exceptions that would require all undergraduate and graduate courses to be offered on a P/NP or S/U basis in Spring 2020. There is too much variation across disciplines, degrees, and student needs to advance a uniform policy. Below is a summary of actions approved by the Academic Senate as limitedterm exceptions for Spring Quarter 2020, to temporarily change San Diego Senate Regulations relating to the Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory (S/U) grades and temporarily extend the deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses and changing a course grading option. These updates are also posted on the Academic Senate website: https://senate.ucsd.edu/COVID19AcademicSenateUpdates 1. Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades The Educational Policy Committee proposed, and Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020, the following exceptions to Senate Regulations related to P/NP and S/U grades in Spring 2020. These limitedterm exceptions are intended to provide more flexibility to students who prefer taking courses on a P/NP or S/U basis. A onetime exception to the San Diego Senate Regulation on the P/NP grade limit to exempt all P/NP courses taken during Spring 2020 from the 25% limit on the number of UCSD units that undergraduate students are allowed to complete on a P/NP basis. P/NP courses completed during Spring 2020 should be removed from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the percentage of courses taken on a pass/no pass basis. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.1: https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2) A onetime exception to San Diego Senate Regulations on P/NP and S/U grades to extend the deadlines for undergraduate and graduate students to register on a P/NP or S/U basis to the end of Week 10 in Spring 2020. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.2: https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2 and 500.E.6: https://go.ucsd.edu/39dBOla) The Undergraduate and Graduate Councils authorized allowing departments and colleges to offer undergraduate and graduate courses approved with the grading option of “Letter Grade Only” on a P/NP or S/U basis. This is a onetime exception for Spring 2020. Additional Information for Temporary Changes in Pass/No Pass and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading: Senate Council supports allowing departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements when possible. Many departments, programs, and colleges require courses applied to the major or general education requirements to be taken on a letter grade basis. It is up to the individual departments and colleges to decide whether to make an exception to their requirements and allow courses taken on a P/NP or S/U basis to apply towards major or degree requirements. To the extent possible, Senate Council strongly encourages departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements for major courses, degree requirements, and prerequisites during Spring 2020 as such actions have the potential to mitigate stress and anxiety among students. Instructors may not require that all students enroll in their course on a P/NP or S/U basis. Senate Council’s approval to relax the current requirements for enrollment on a P/NP and S/U basis is not a license for an instructor to require that all students must register for their course on a P/NP basis in a course that allows for letter or P/NP grading. These accommodations are being made to afford flexibility to students. 2. Deadlines for Adding, Dropping, and Withdrawing from Courses Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020 extending the following deadlines for adding and dropping courses and withdrawals as a limitedterm exception for Spring 2020. These deadlines are being extended to support students and faculty adjusting to remote instruction. (San Diego Senate Regulation 501: https://go.ucsd.edu/2J5AOoK) Deadline to Add a Course: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to add a course is extended from the end of the second week of instruction to the end of the third week of instruction. Deadline to Drop a Course without a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter without W grades: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to drop a course or all courses without a W grade on the transcript (i.e. a drop without a W grade) is extended from the end of the fourth week of instruction to the end of the fifth week of instruction. Deadline to Drop a Course with a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter with W grades: The deadline for undergraduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is extended from the end of the sixth week of instruction to the end of the seventh week of instruction. The deadline for graduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is the end of the ninth week of instruction (no change). An undergraduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the seventh week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the appropriate provost for undergraduate students. A graduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the ninth week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Additional Information for Temporary Changes to Enrollment Deadlines As the quarter progresses, instructors are reminded to be mindful about providing feedback to students at multiple points during the quarter. It is important that students are able to make informed decisions about their course enrollments.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Dear Colleagues, As we navigate the developing COVID-19 crisis, many are concerned about the potential impact on scholarly and creative work during the Spring quarter due to issues such as inability to use on-campus facilities to conduct teaching or research activities, limited ability to travel to conferences or to conduct research and/or creative activity in remote locations, reduced access to human subjects, and limited interactions within instructional cohorts or research groups and in studios and laboratories. In recognition of these issues, and in consultation with the UC San Diego Division of the Academic Senate, Academic Personnel Services is implementing the following protective/proactive measures, effective immediately. EXTENSION OF THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR FACULTY AND OTHER ACADEMIC APPOINTEES SUBJECT TO AN EIGHT-YEAR LIMITATION ON SERVICE AT THE ASSISTANT LEVEL: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant event beyond the control of any member of the UC San Diego community, disrupting our academic enterprise. Policy provides that campus may accord an assistant-level academic appointee subject to an eight-year probationary clock up to two one-year extensions to the probationary period; any request for an exception to allow a third one-year extension requires approval by the UC Office of the Provost. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of APM 133 and PPM 230-15, effective immediately, UC San Diego will automatically extend the probationary period by one year for each assistant-level appointee whose appointment began on or before June 30, 2020 and who is subject to an eight-year clock, provided that the individual has not previously been granted two such extensions. Appointees who have already submitted their file for promotion review may be eligible on a case-by-case basis. If an assistant-level appointee whose appointment began on or before June 30, 2020, who is subject to an eight-year clock, and who has previously been granted two one-year extensions would like to request a policy exception in order to obtain a COVID-19-related extension to their probationary period, they should address the exception request to the Executive Vice Chancellor and submit it to Academic Personnel Services via the Department Chair and Dean. UC San Diego will support the exception request and forward it for additional review by the UC Office of the Provost. In accordance with PPM 230-15, an extension of the probationary period will not prevent an appointee from requesting consideration of promotion sooner than is required. Assistant-level appointees should be proposed for promotion whenever they are deemed ready for such advancement. An appointee may decline to have a COVID-19-related automatic extension applied to their probationary period. A request to decline a COVID-19-related automatic extension may be addressed to the Executive Vice Chancellor and submitted to Academic Personnel Services via the Department Chair and Dean. A toolkit and updated FAQ for implementation of probationary period extensions is forthcoming. \"BARRIER REVIEW\" CASES (PROMOTION TO FULL, ADVANCEMENT TO STEP VI AND ADVANCEMENT TO ABOVE SCALE): Senior faculty and academics whose scholarly work has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis may choose to defer their academic review for one year. This deferral will not impact established departmental expectations for achievement during a normal two-, three-, or four-year review cycle. Academic review following a deferral will not be considered off-cycle. Appointees who have one or more consecutive deferrals should contact Academic Personnel Services to determine eligibility. We will continue to provide updates and guidance as the situation evolves. Please contact AVC Cindy Palmer (c5palmer@ucsd.edu) with any questions. With best regards, Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor Elizabeth H. Simmons Executive Vice Chancellor         577\n",
      "33  24-Mar-20  Diego    CA             As we enter the spring quarter, we would like to take a moment to express our deep gratitude to each of you for stepping up to navigate the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of just a few weeks, the rapid spread of the virus has turned a normal winter quarter upside down. To slow the rate of infection and to keep our community safe, we canceled in-person gatherings and moved all exams to remote or take-home format. During this stressful time, students and instructors kept up with their academic progress and completed final exams. Staff kept up with the many operational changes needed to keep the institution moving. And our amazing healthcare team has been caring for COVID-19 patients and preparing our hospitals for an influx of new patients. We commend you all for your remarkable flexibility and resilience. You have truly exemplified the Triton spirit. In spite of all the extraordinary precautionary measures we have taken at UC San Diego, one of our students has tested positive for COVID-19. This reinforces our need to aggressively practice social distancing and to be more diligent in our unified goal to stop the spread of the virus. All indications are that the next seven to 10 days WILL see a much faster spread of this virus than we have seen before. As a result, for your own safety and the safety of others, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO FOLLOW THE CDC’S GUIDELINES VERY CAREFULLY AND EXPLICITLY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. The guidelines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html. Moving forward, below are campus updates that will help address some concerns we have identified. GRADING POLICY AND COURSE DEADLINES UC San Diego’s Academic Senate has approved one-time accommodations that afford students greater flexibility around choosing whether to take courses on a P/NP (pass/no pass)(undergraduate) or S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory)(graduate) basis during Spring 2020. Details are at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html#Spring-2020-Grading-Policies and key points are summarized below. Students should consult with their department, college, and financial aid advisors about their individual circumstances before making decisions about their grading options or course schedules. Faculty should provide clear and consistent feedback to students at multiple points throughout the quarter so that students can make informed decisions. Courses taken in Spring 2020 will be exempt from the 25% limit on the number of UC San Diego units that undergraduates may complete on a P/NP basis. The deadline for registering to take a course on a P/NP (or S/U) basis will be the end of week 10. The deadline for adding undergraduate or graduate courses will be the end of week three. Certain drop/withdrawal deadlines have been pushed later; others remain on their original schedules. Academic departments and colleges may offer courses that were originally approved as “Letter Grade Only” on a P/NP (undergraduate) or S/U (graduate) basis during spring 2020. REMOTE INSTRUCTION, COPYRIGHT, CONTINUITY PLANS, AND RESEARCH Instructors who need to come to campus to record/podcast lectures or do other crucial tasks associated with remote instruction may come to campus for that specific purpose. Please have your campus ID. Remote teaching need not be fully synchronous. Indeed, lectures delivered in real-time must also be made available in an asynchronous format via Canvas to ensure students who are ill or in another time zone can fully participate in the course. For options and resources, see https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu. Total student-instructor interaction time (including virtual office hours via Zoom, Canvas chat, etc.) should fulfill the expected total contact hours for the course; see: https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/faq.html#Class-Meetings-and-Attendance Guidance on copyright of instructional materials is available at https://go.ucsd.edu/398MYrG. As discussed in the guidance for chairs, provosts, deans and instructors (at https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/campusrequirements.html), each instructor should share with their unit leader the continuity plan to be followed if the instructor becomes ill. Tactics for making a course resilient include posting material on Canvas in advance and pre-identification of potential alternative instructors. See also: https://go.ucsd.edu/2vMx74p Faculty should bear in mind that undergraduate and graduate students cannot be required to work in person on campus during the stay-at-home order; this specifically includes research and instructional duties. AS THE NEXT TWO WEEKS ARE CRITICAL IN LIMITING NEW CORONAVIRUS EXPOSURE, RESEARCH SETTINGS WILL STRICTLY APPLY STAFF LIMITS, SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SANITATION REQUIREMENTS. Specifically, students are strongly discouraged from coming to their research sites; there should be no more than one person per site at any given time (e.g., use shifts when necessary), social distancing should be rigorously adhered to, and sanitation efforts (limiting unneeded touching of equipment, cleaning high touch spaces such as door knobs, light switches and key boards) should be fully implemented. No student (undergraduate, graduate or postdoctoral scholar) should be required to come to the lab for their work, and flexibility should be afforded to the completion of the research projects. Challenges to this policy should be directed to deans and the Vice Chancellor for Research for final management. HOUSING UPDATE A considerable number of undergraduate students who can take their spring quarter classes from home have already cancelled their housing contracts, which will allow University Housing in the coming weeks to take steps to socially distance students in their residential communities. For the spring quarter, students remaining in campus housing will be reassigned from triples and doubles to single bedrooms. These students will not be assessed an additional charge as University Housing moves forward with this change. Students remaining in campus housing will receive more detailed information via email after spring break. The goal is to ensure that everyone is settled by early spring quarter. Any requests for reinstatement of the housing contract will need to meet the following exception criterion. Students should consider living on campus during the spring quarter ONLY if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who are remaining on campus for Spring Break are reminded of the importance of physical distancing to further ensure the health and well-being of our community. Starting April 1, an unoccupied residential building has been designated for isolation housing. We are unable to share any additional information, including specific locations or room assignments, due to student privacy concerns. The university will be in contact with students in isolation and will offer support during recovery. Students will receive all of their basic needs while in isolation, and Student Health Services will advise students to remain inside the housing unit. Resources to support Spring Quarter 2020 Remote Instruction, Health and Well-Being and Community Resources will continue to be regularly added to the main website: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT We encourage you to visit Handshake at https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/login to review NEW open remote positions for student employees. You will find remote positions already posted as the campus seeks to hire student employees to provide faculty with additional IT instructional support for spring 2020. Student Affairs will be hosting a “Remote Employment for Students” webinar on March 26 from 3 to 4 p.m., PST. Join the webinar at https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/262683228 or call 213-338-8477 or 669-219-2599. The meeting ID is 262 683 228. MOVING FORWARD We are in the midst of unprecedented disruption to our society and our everyday lives. With that said, we are so proud and grateful to see the strong spirit of our Triton community emerge in the face of such historic change. Though our friends and colleagues may appear only on a screen, and though our memories of a lively campus—the bustle of Library Walk on a sunny afternoon or the view of the surf from North Torrey Pines—we are nevertheless keeping our sense of UC San Diego alive through many acts of empathy, compassion, generosity and connection. We are certain that our lives will return to normal, and we promise to keep you informed as we learn more about how and when this will occur. For now, please be vigilant about protecting your health and the health of others. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference for everyone. Thank you for all your efforts and your continued cooperation. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor Elizabeth H.

pandemic, we are extending the 2020-21 CDIIP Application deadline to Friday, April 24, 2020. The application is available at: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html CDIIP provides funding to support faculty projects that enhance undergraduate instruction and to encourage faculty experimenting with new instructional technologies including the creation of digital resources and the development of hybrid or flipped courses. Funding is available in two forms: The CDIIP Committee looks for projects that can improve the quality of undergraduate education, impact many students, improve time-to-degree, and increase interactions between faculty and students. We especially encourage proposals that address the varied needs and perspectives of our diverse student population. Faculty members are encouraged to develop projects with comprehensive strategies to improve undergraduate instruction in collaboration with their departments or academic units and the Teaching + Learning Commons (http://commons.ucsd.edu/). Faculty members are also encouraged to consult with the Library for assistance in identifying topical ebooks, media, open educational resources, digital scholarship tools, and other information resources already available to faculty and students. Proposals for funding are reviewed by the CDIIP Committee. The Executive Vice Chancellor – Academic Affairs makes final allocation decisions. The CDIIP is not specifically aimed at supporting the development of fully-online classes. However, faculty interested in developing online classes are encouraged to discuss their interests with the Digital Learning Hub (https://digitallearning.ucsd.edu/). Alternate avenues of support for course development in these cases may be available (e.g. the UCOP Innovative Learning Technology Initiative: http://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/ or through the EVC Office Educational Innovation initiative: Contact wettouati@health.ucsd.edu or gchemingway@ucsd.edu for information). Application Criteria: Full-time senate faculty who are engaged in undergraduate education are eligible to submit proposals. Awards are made in the form of grants to cover expenses including but not limited to faculty release time, faculty summer support, summer undergraduate/graduate student support, support for Educational Technology Services or other technical assistance, materials, or other justifiable expenses. Applications must include a plan for assessing student learning outcomes and for sustaining the project efforts beyond the duration of the grant. A progress report for each CDIIP award is due on June 15 of the following year. A letter from the department chair and endorsement from the Commons and/or Educational Technology Services are also required for many grants applications (see website for details: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html).

Today we make Triton history as together we embark upon our very first virtual quarter. All courses and student experiences will be conducted remotely to stop the spread of coronavirus. Instructors and students are asked to become familiar with academic continuity tools and are invited to join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning at https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html. Technical resources for instructors are available at https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu and https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html. Technical resources for students are available at https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu; https://commons.ucsd.edu/covid-19/students.html; and https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html. Instructors and staff have been busy preparing for today, working to create a smooth transition to virtual formats. This quick turn-around means there will be bumps. We ask that everyone practice courtesy during the first two weeks of the quarter as we all find our bearings and adjust. We are all in this together, so be kind to one another, help each other over the phone and online when possible, and extend patience, empathy and compassion when experiencing hurdles. RETURNING FROM SPRING BREAK: PRECAUTIONS Campus residents returning from New York, New Jersey, or Louisiana are asked to self-isolate for 14 days until the concern about COVID-19 transmission is over, since the CDC reports that these areas are experiencing surges in virus transmission. Self-isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people for the full 14-day period. Self-isolation may require a temporary move to another space on campus. Housing and Dining Services will be providing meal delivery service for students with a meal plan during self-isolation. Any student returning to on-campus housing from these three locations should log in to the Housing Portal at https://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/currentresidents/pages/ and complete the return form. STAY-AT-HOME ORDER & STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT California is under a “stay-at-home” executive order issued by Governor Gavin Newsom. This means going out for purposes other than ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES is a fineable act with a $1,000 fine or up to six months in jail according to San Diego County Sheriff William Gore. Examples of essential activities are medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to secure groceries and necessary supplies. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities, please observe strict social distancing. The objective of social distancing is to reduce the probability of contact between persons carrying an infection, and others who are not infected, so as to minimize disease transmission. Provide six feet between you and anyone else you may come into contact with. “Flattening the curve” and maintaining the health and wellbeing of our community is everyone’s responsibility. With this in mind, we want to be transparent that any failure to comply with self-quarantine or related orders risks the health and safety of our community. As such, it may violate the Student Conduct Code with respect to Section VII (P) Failure to Comply, and Section VII (H) Health & Safety, and will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for follow-up. OUR PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY IN THE ONLINE CLASSROOM Our goal is to deliver the best educational experience possible, even under these difficult conditions. Observing our Principles of Community (https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) in the virtual classroom environment will help us to create and maintain a positive and vibrant online learning community. Recognize and take into consideration that our richly diverse cultures and life experiences will influence our online engagement. Treat each other with respect and the dignity we all deserve. If you witness or experience online behavior that constitutes harassment or discrimination, remember to report it to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) at https://ophd.ucsd.edu. THANK YOU & BEST OF LUCK THIS QUARTER We would like to thank our hard-working staff, faculty, and student leaders for their incredible work to prepare us to have a spring quarter on time and in a new format. We appreciate all that you are doing to make our remote UC San Diego presence a strong Triton community. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone. Thank you for your continued cooperation. Pradeep K.

As Tritons, we must embody our principles of community and always practice empathy, compassion and kindness. Today, these principles direct us to look after not only our own wellbeing but also that of our campus and the San Diego community. Although this pandemic is one of the most difficult challenges we’ve faced as a society, we need to remember that viruses are not new. We have sufficient knowledge to understand how they are transmitted, how they reproduce and how they change. In time, we will also gain a better understanding of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Science will prevail. We simply need as much time and as many resources as possible to create a solution as efficiently as possible. The world needs your help to “buy more time” to allow this process to happen. How do you do this? Stop the transmission. Educate yourself. Internalize your role within your community. Closely follow health guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Learn all you can about the virus and the disease it causes in order to be prepared to act if you develop symptoms. Understand that you are an individual within a larger ecosystem. Without it, you cannot be an individual, and without the collection of individuals, the ecosystem cannot exist. STOP THE TRANSMISSION Today, our ecosystem, our society needs our help. It needs our thoughtful individual action and it needs it right now. Everyone—campus residents and those at remote locations—needs to commit to more aggressive physical distancing measures, not just for your own health and safety, but also for the health and safety of your friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and fellow community residents. Stay home or in your campus residence. Period. Do not engage in contact sports or activities that require sharing equipment or close contact. Limit personal interactions to phone or online formats. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities—medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to buy groceries and necessary supplies—please maintain at least six feet between you and anyone else you may see while you are out. When you return to your residence, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and wipe down items purchased on your visit. Clean surfaces such as countertops, desks, and vanities regularly with household cleaner. Be sure also to clean highly touched surfaces such as phones, laptops, and other appliances. Laptops, keyboards, phones and other objects should not be shared with others unless they are thoroughly cleaned between users. EDUCATE YOURSELF: SARS-CoV-2 & COVID-19 While taking careful steps to stop the spread of the virus, it is important to continually learn about it. As our collective knowledge grows, we will identify other individual actions we can take to help. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold and pneumonia. COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2. Not everyone who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 develops COVID-19. Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild to moderate cold and flu-like symptoms. But some people—usually those with other medical complications—may develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia. Using available preliminary data, the World Health Organization estimates the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases of COVID-19 is approximately two weeks and is three to six weeks for patients with severe or critical disease. COVID-19 symptoms including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, and/or a persistent scratchy throat appear an average of five to six days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC. If you are a student with these symptoms, contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3302 for instructions on how to proceed. Faculty and staff should contact their healthcare provider and/or primary care physician for further instructions. Visit the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/ to stay up to date on our growing knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. CAMPUS UPDATE: CARING FOR OUR SICK Our society also needs our kindness right now. It needs all of us to care about those who are sick and those whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by the pandemic. UC San Diego’s first priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors. There are three students on campus who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. UC San Diego medical staff are currently contacting others who may have been in contact with these three students to determine next steps. In most but not all cases, testing and self-isolation are advised. Students living on campus who have been in contact with anyone (student or otherwise) who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or has developed COVID-19 should contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3300. To maintain confidentiality, and to be compliant with federal law (see Notice of Privacy Practices at https://wellness.ucsd.edu/studenthealth/about/HIPAA/Pages/default.aspx), we are not identifying isolated students nor their locations. Please keep in mind that just because someone is in self-isolation does not mean they have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or are ill with COVID-19. At some point in our lives, we all experience illness. It’s not a crime to be sick. We expect and hope all Tritons will practice empathy towards those in isolation awaiting test results, those who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 and those who have developed COVID-19. HELP FOR OUR COMMUNITY UC San Diego is also a public institution. As the region’s only academic medical center, we have a responsibility to care for members of our community especially in times of great need. UC San Diego has contracted with the County of San Diego to provide 350 rooms in a new campus housing building that is not currently occupied by students. If needed, one Nuevo East building will be used by the county as a creative medical treatment center that will accept “step-down” and low-level cases of COVID-19 to make room for more serious cases at area hospitals. Step-down cases are those who have recovered and passed the most severe stages of COVID-19. The center will also house doctors and nurses who will be responsible for patients receiving care at the facility. We are proud to be a community partner by providing a building they can use and manage for their purposes. The County has leased the entire building; UC San Diego will not be assigning any students to housing in that building for the duration of the lease. Campus residents who are in self-isolation awaiting test results or who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be housed in a separate building. Because all spring quarter classes and student experiences are being offered remotely, students who had been living on campus were offered refunds for housing if they moved out by March 31. This has yielded more than enough space on campus to ensure proper social distancing for those students remaining. THE ROAD AHEAD From the birth of our experimental campus, UC San Diego faculty, researchers, staff and students made a commitment to collaborate with knowledge builders inside and outside the institution to look deeper at the world around us in order to solve society’s most pressing issues. This poignant moment in history provides a true test of that commitment. We are meeting the challenge. We are facing this pandemic together, in collaboration, united for a common purpose. We are working with the world’s top minds to demystify this new virus and the disease it causes. We are doing our part to stop the spread of the virus. We are caring for our sick and providing needed resources to our community. I am proud of our response and prouder still of our performance under pressure. I offer special thanks to our staff, faculty and clinicians who have been instrumental in keeping the campus and our health system operational during this crisis. I also thank our residence life staff, custodial staff, dining hall staff, student health staff, emergency operations staff, executive policy group, Chancellor’s Cabinet, divisional deans and college provosts, faculty, students, and of course everyone in our medical centers. Your commitment and dedication to UC San Diego and each other are exemplary. The road ahead requires renewed commitment to community. This crisis will have a lasting, long-term effect for ourselves, our families, our friends and colleagues and countless people we do not know. I am grateful for everyone’s continued cooperation. Stay the course, and we will see an end to this crisis in due time. Thank you. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor        1428\n",



of our community, the U.S. healthcare system, and the economy. The welfare and safety of our community during this time is our primary concern. Yet in every crisis there are those who will attempt to profit from the chaos and disruption created. Across the Internet we are seeing evidence of organized crime attempting to lure unsuspecting users to bogus COVID-19 information websites that quietly download malicious software designed to steal corporate and personal information. A recent example uses the actual COVID-19 data taken off an identical (legitimate) site provided by Johns Hopkins University. This can be safely viewed at https://app.box.com/v/coronavirusscam. In addition, federal law enforcement and the FTC are reporting a massive growth of spam, phishing, and text messaging, as well as web-based advertising offering false COVID-19 cures, treatments, and personal protection advice. THE IMPERATIVE: PROTECT YOURSELF Do not respond to email, phone, or digital advertising pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rely instead on established, respected news sources, such as: UC San Diego’s Information Page: https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/ The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus The UN’s Coronavirus Portal: https://www.un.org/coronavirus While UC San Diego’s anti-spam service has been stopping several large coronavirus-related phishing campaigns, some messages will manage to get delivered. If you receive a suspicious email, please forward it to abuse@ucsd.edu, where it will be automatically analyzed and the results used to prevent additional deliveries. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: PROTECT YOURSELF AND THE UNIVERSITY AT HOME At home, your laptop or home computer does not benefit from the full range of protections computers receive when on campus. Loaner or emergency laptops and tablets are also less likely to be managed by campus IT professionals. Please take the following actions when using a home or loaner computer off campus. If your computer is not managed by campus IT staff, or is a loaner or emergency computer, immediately run the system update service that installs software fixes for known security weaknesses in your software. Apple instructions https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac Windows instructions https://bit.ly/3dKBgHj Install a quality antivirus product on your personal computer. The campus recommends the Sophos Home edition. See https://antivirus.ucsd.edu for more information. When logging into the campus VPN, use the group “2-step secured - allthruucsd”. This will ensure that all of the traffic to your computer runs through campus network-based security sensors. While working on university business, this is the preferred VPN group. UC San Diego Health remote users should use the ucsdh-vpn.ucsd.edu Health VPN (ucsdh-vpn.ucsd.edu) or connect via CWP, depending on the specific instructions you received from the Health IS team. Make sure that all your personal banking, investment, and email accounts are protected by two-step login, also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Most commercial services do this by texting you a short code to a phone registered with the service. Take the time to set this up immediately. With the tremendous reliance on Zoom within higher education, a phenomenon known as “Zoom Bombing” is becoming common. Our colleagues at UC Berkeley have an informative description of what Zoom Bombing is and how to prevent it: https://bit.ly/2Xe9yNl WHAT WE’RE DOING TO PROTECT YOU In addition to the campus’s usual security support mechanisms, we are exploring several additional techniques to identify and block coronavirus-related scams and to further protect university faculty, staff, and students while working remotely. Further announcements will be made as these are implemented. Please feel free to contact the IT Services or Health service desks as appropriate for support at https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/help-desk/service-desk/index.html and send comments or suggestions directly to me at mcorn@ucsd.edu.

can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time. The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together. Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time. To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus. To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time. To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID-19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible. While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary. Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together. Fiat lux, Janet Napolitano President, University of California Carol T.

presented our campus and community with extraordinary challenges. I would like to offer my sincerest thanks to you, my fellow academics, for your efforts on behalf of our students, faculty, staff, and the broader community. I understand that many of you are also navigating personal matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Your evident dedication to UC San Diego's educational, scholarly, clinical, and engagement missions during this difficult time makes me proud to be a Triton. Together you've enabled the university to transition well over a thousand Spring Quarter courses to remote instruction, almost overnight. I know that making this pivot while also finishing out Winter Quarter and holding final exams in unfamiliar formats was a monumental challenge. You have risen to it magnificently. I deeply appreciate your collective response to our call for educational continuity - the creativity and energy demonstrated as you've redesigned courses, embraced new approaches, and collaborated thoughtfully with designers in the Teaching + Learning Commons and Educational Technology Services. It's also been wonderful to hear about your collegiality in sharing knowledge with each other as you prepare to teach remotely. And you have accomplished this while staying home and contributing to social distancing, as frustrating and isolating as that can be. I'm inspired by your commitment to enabling all students to continue their studies, regardless of their personal circumstances - whether they are ill, navigating new technology, in a different time zone or just feeling apprehensive. As the spring quarter progresses, our students who are facing challenges due to the pandemic will increasingly appreciate your continued efforts to ensure that all course materials and opportunities for engagement are offered asynchronously to all of our students. They will also appreciate opportunities to connect with you via Zoom or Canvas chat for free-flowing discussions about everything from course topics to graduate school and careers. You represent a beacon of hope and continuity for them. Not only have you dramatically changed the way you teach but the rest of the work we are doing as a campus is also more important than ever. The decisive action of our faculty and staff has enabled UC San Diego to keep teaching (https://go.ucsd.edu/33KeDhr), keep learning (https://go.ucsd.edu/346XsGQ), and keep working (https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/remote-work/index.html) so we may continue to serve the people of the state of California during these turbulent times. The research, applied work, and clinical care many of you are undertaking to provide for the needs of current patients, counter the spread of the virus, and move us closer to treatments and a cure is vital. Moreover, doing this in the midst of a crisis demonstrates great courage. Despite everyone's herculean efforts during this public health emergency, we will continue to face a long list of challenges and unknowns as the global situation evolves. Please know that your efforts are deeply appreciated and that you are not alone in this. I and your Deans, Chairs and colleagues throughout the campus are here to help and support you.

In order to hear more from you about this, I will be hosting Research Town Hall webinars on April 9th and April 15th to answer and address questions, and inform you about our efforts to ensure that UC San Diego’s research continues to thrive in the months ahead. Please read on for information about those events and other important information. RESEARCH TOWN HALLS Find out more information about, and register for, Research Town Hall webinars to be held April 9th and April 15th from 12:30–2:00pm at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/index.html. We’ll have representatives from the Office of Grants and Contracts, Research Proposal Development Services, the Animal Care Program, Human Research Protection Program, and other offices on hand to answer questions and hear from you. FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES Bookmark and regularly visit our COVID-19 Funding Opportunities listing at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/research-ops.html to stay up-to-date on current opportunities. UCOP is finalizing plans to support and incentivize research on SARS/CoV-2 and COVID-19. We anticipate that once details are finalized, the deadlines for submitting proposals will be quite soon. Open UC Opportunities: The UC Institute of Transportation Studies (http://www.ucits.org/covid-19/) Data Collection Grant will fund immediate data collection needs that either 1) inform broader COVID-19 Response and Recovery research activities or 2) take advantage of natural experiments that can inform future transportation research on themes relevant to the UC ITS research program. Data collection proposals are due Sunday, April 19th. The University’s Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives RFP, available at https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/mrpi/index.html. MRPI projects are multicampus or systemwide research collaborations, and therefore a good opportunity for collaboration with colleagues at other UC campuses to join forces in response to the pandemic. Letters of Intent are due by noon on April 22nd. Additional funding opportunities: Numerous federal agencies and other organizations have issued RfPs for research related to COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the c3.ai Digital Transformation Institute are among those with open calls for new proposals to support such research. Additionally, federal agencies are making supplemental funding available to those with current grants to help cover the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visit the OCGA website at https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/ocga/covid-19-updates.html for the most recent guidance about proposal and reporting deadlines, allowable costs, managing awards, and compensatory supplements. Information is available there from NIH, NSF, DoE, DoD, and other funding agencies. Contact your local grants management staff as well as agency project managers to inform them of impacts of the pandemic that will lead to extension or supplemental funding requests. Track closely all expenses related to COVID-19 to assist in the preparation of those supplemental funding requests. In addition to the assistance your departmental business offices can offer in preparation of supplemental funding and new proposals, Research Affairs has expanded assistance available to help you. Contact researchdevelopment@ucsd.edu for assistance. Finally, ORA has created an online portal for researchers interested in pursuing COVID-19 related research to identify one another. Please visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/research-ops.html to see the listing or to add yourself to it. RESEARCH PERSONNEL We know that it takes time to build an effective and stable research team, and that the reduction of on-site research activity required to maintain necessary physical distancing and safeguard public health puts those teams at risk. We encourage all PIs to maintain their research staff by assigning all staff members work that can be done remotely, such as data analysis, updating laboratory SOPs, literature reviews, and grant preparation. The interruption to on-site research is an opportunity to for staff to complete required trainings, or to learn how to engage in work that they normally do not have time to learn. Our goal is to help you maintain the stability of your research team so that when a return to on-site research is feasible, you’ll be able to “ramp-up” without being slowed down by staff vacancies. Information specific to supporting graduate students in your lab is available from the UC San Diego Graduate School (graduatedean@ucsd.edu). Information on supporting other research personnel will be regularly updated at https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/covid-19/index.html. UC San Diego Triton ingenuity and commitment to community are the best resources we have to meet the current challenge. That ingenuity and commitment have been demonstrated across the campus as researchers work to refocus their effort and redirect their expertise in response to this challenge. It’s an honor for all of us to work with you in this effort. Thank you for your continued commitment to outstanding and innovative research and scholarly activity during this emergency. Sandra A.

      To accelerate urgently needed breakthroughs in the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of California will provide $2 million in seed funding to scientists across the state to help jump-start their high-impact research projects. Awards of up to $25,000 are available immediately, said Theresa Maldonado, Ph.D., vice president of UC’s systemwide Research and Innovation division. The goal is to help researchers begin work as soon possible, knowing that larger federal grants may take longer to be distributed. The awards are being funded by three statewide research grant programs UC administers that focus on breast cancer, tobacco-related disease and HIV/AIDS. “Given that people who suffer from breast cancer, HIV and tobacco-related diseases are also among those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, it made sense to begin urgently directing some of that research funding to this global pandemic,” Maldonado said. “Our goal is to seed work in areas that can have a big impact in a short amount of time and to help the California communities that need it most.” Research proposals will be evaluated as they are received, with priority going to those that meet three criteria: a strong potential for impacting the pandemic in the near term; the ability of researchers to start work right away; and a research focus that will help California’s most vulnerable populations. Maldonado and other UC leaders have also been spearheading an effort to facilitate greater collaboration on COVID-19 research among scientists and researchers across UC’s five medical centers, three national laboratories and 10 campuses. A rapid-response survey of UC researchers yielded roughly 300 researchers whose work can help inform the medical and public health response to the pandemic in areas deemed by the World Health Organization to be of the highest priority. “The adverse health and economic impact of the pandemic, as it plays out in California, cannot be overstated,” Maldonado said. “But the University of California has broad expertise in critical areas that can help with a rapid response to this unprecedented health crisis.”         330\n",

               UC San Diego is continuing to adapt to changes in operations during these extraordinary times of global pandemic. We recognize that the impact of the coronavirus has meant some business operations and staff have been asked to take on significant new work responsibilities, while at the same time we may have staff who are available and would like to contribute their skills to other UC San Diego teams that need temporary additional labor resources. In the Triton spirit of innovation and collaboration, we are pleased to announce the launch of the UC San Diego Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse (T-WOC), a collaboration designed to bring together operations that need additional staffing with those who have skills and talent to offer their colleagues. Managers who need additional help in their areas will submit requests to the Clearinghouse, including the nature of the help they are seeking. At the same time, managers who have identified available employees in their units will submit information to the Clearinghouse including their employees’ job position and skills. The Clearinghouse will look for a match and manage the connection. The Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse is managed by Campus Human Resources through its Temporary Employee Services division, which has deep knowledge and a strong track record of providing short-term staffing services across campus. Learn more about the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse at https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/clearinghouse.html. Here are a few important things to know about the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse: If your department is already engaged in redeploying staff within your unit, you do not need to use the Clearinghouse service. However, if you would like to take advantage of the structure the Clearinghouse offers, you are welcome to use it for internal staff redeployment support. The TWOC program is available for use by current policy-covered or represented career staff across all university departments, including UC San Diego Health System and Health Sciences. Available staff will be redeployed into roles with a similar skillset and title code and will thus continue receiving the same pay as their regular role. The requesting department pays 50% of the salary of the staff member that is redeployed to their area. These financial transactions will be handled by the financial representatives of the loaning and requesting departments (not by Human Resources). If you are interested in taking advantage of the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse, visit https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/covid-19/clearinghouse.html to learn more and submit your requests. If you have questions about T-WOC, contact t-woc@ucsd.edu. We're proud to offer the Temporary Work Opportunity Clearinghouse as it supports UC San Diego and the people who work here on two critical fronts: providing operational assistance to areas that have seen a significant increase in work volume due to COVID-19, while creating opportunities for greater collaboration, hands-on professional development and cross-training for staff. With gratitude to our staff community for all you are doing in these extraordinary times, Pierre Ouillet Vice Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer Nancy E.

                                                                The current public health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will impact not only the Spring Quarter, but also our Summer Session. In order to continue the vital social distancing that contributes to public health, UC San Diego will continue to deliver all instruction by remote means during Summer 2020. This includes all Summer Session courses and Summer Success programs offered by any unit. The Academic Senate has approved an emergency exception to the Policy on Distance Education Courses to allow for remote instruction for the entire duration of Summer Session 2020. Course materials fees will not be applied to Summer Session courses. Enrollment for Summer Session for UC San Diego students begins April 13. More information is available at https://summersession.ucsd.edu. Proposals by departments and faculty for Summer Session courses are still being accepted and encouraged. Interested faculty may contact Summer Session Director, Becky Arce with any questions at barce@ucsd.edu. Resources to support faculty in remote instruction are available at https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu. Support and resources for students are available to https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu/. SUMMER CAMPUS HOUSING On-campus housing will remain open and operational for summer session. Students remaining in campus housing will be assigned to single-occupancy spaces. Students should consider living on campus during summer session ONLY if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction. Students who are remaining on campus for summer are reminded of the importance of physical distancing to further ensure the health and well-being of our community. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY REMINDER It’s important to remember that UC San Diego’s superb quality and reputation can only be sustained if faculty and students commit to academic integrity. For students, this means that they complete all of their exams in a way that honestly and fairly demonstrates their knowledge and abilities at that particular moment in time. For faculty, that means that they work to design and deliver high-stakes exams in ways that uphold integrity, and they check to ensure that those exams were completed with integrity. It also means that faculty report all suspected academic integrity violations to the Academic Integrity Office. Students should visit https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-students.html for strategies in upholding integrity and sign-up to receive timely integrity reminders and news about integrity contests at https://tinyurl.com/excelwithintegrity. Faculty should visit https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-faculty.html for tips on preventing integrity violations and sign up to receive newsletters with new tips throughout the quarter at https://tinyurl.com/teachintegrity.

Everyone – faculty, instructors, researchers, medical personnel, administration, staff, teaching assistants and others – has been working diligently to keep the University operating under the difficult conditions posed by the novel coronavirus. We have done so with grit and aplomb, even as many of us are under personal and occupational strain. Alongside faculty efforts, the Academic Senate has been extremely active at the policy level, and has been working with (and checking on) the Administration in adapting temporary policy exceptions. We are all in this together, but we retain our different stations in the undertaking of shared governance of the University of California. This note is designed to communicate in specific ways some of what the Senate has been doing. Senate committees have been meeting using remote technology nights and weekends, both at the systemwide and campus levels, endeavoring to mitigate the effects of the current crisis. Senate input and approvals have been sought by, and have been delivered to, the Administration in an active and expedited manner with notification that these are time limited and will need to be re-examined at quarterly intervals. Examples of Senate engagement include: Ensuring that difficulties encountered in research and teaching during the spring quarter will not negatively impact faculty reviews. Evaluating the Senate-Administration Taskforce report on holistic teaching evaluation to expand teaching evaluations beyond CAPEs. Creating exceptions to policy to allow classes to be taught remotely, while endeavoring to safeguard privacy in remote instruction and the faculty’s intellectual property. Extending the deadlines to add and drop courses and to select pass/no pass or satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades to provide students with more flexibility. Removing courses completed pass/no pass in spring quarter from the limit on pass/no pass courses that may apply towards the bachelor’s degree. Encouraging departments to relax letter-grade requirements. Extending time limits by one quarter for all current doctoral students. Senate committees continue with the day-to-day business of the University (approving courses, programs, curricula, academic file reviews, etc.). Senate leadership wishes to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the committees and especially their chairs. Clearly, this crisis is not over, and the work of the Senate has not ceased. There will continue to be Representative Assembly meetings at which proposed actions and policies will need discussion and votes from Assembly representatives.

UC San Diego is making plans for the fall quarter based upon current forecasting models. The situation will continue to evolve, and our plans may change to meet emerging needs or unforeseen circumstances. All decisions are being made with the health and safety of our campus community as our top priority. We know that you have many questions. This campus notice provides an update on current plans, and we will continue to update you as the situation evolves. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS At this time, it is our intention to offer courses across all of our divisions, colleges, programs and majors through a combination of in-person and remote instruction. We are working closely with public health officials and will continue to refine the balance between in-person and remote offerings as the situation evolves. Depending on the public health context, it may become necessary to transition our classes exclusively to remote learning; if that happens, we will notify you as soon as possible. Students will receive an outstanding UC San Diego education no matter the method of instructional delivery. We recognize that some students may not be able to safely travel to campus for fall quarter. We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as part of our approach for fall 2020 in a way that ensures students who cannot be present are still able to have a rich and high-quality educational experience. Likewise, our academic support services through the divisions, departments, colleges and Teaching + Learning Commons will be available in both in-person and remote formats to meet students’ needs. TUITION AND FEES Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services help cover infrastructure and operations that provide important service and support through all methods of instruction. Examples of what tuition and fees support include the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, remote academic advising and tutoring. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the academic year. Campus-based fees support campus services, maintain facilities, and broadly support and preserve the campus infrastructure. As campus operations adjust to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dedicated team of professionals remains committed to delivering the highest quality service possible. Campus-based fees will continue to be collected and will not be refunded. HOUSING & DINING We are working to balance our commitment to on-campus living while also promoting public health and safety during this crisis. At this time, it is our intention to keep residential halls and apartments open, but we are eliminating triple-occupancy housing options to facilitate social distancing. We are working closely with and will follow all directives from our local public health authorities. If public health considerations cause us to implement remote-only instruction, we will continue to provide a UC San Diego-quality education in a remote setting, and we will not charge students for the unused portion of their contracts for university-owned housing and for university dining. We will also work with students to facilitate necessary adjustments to their financial aid awards. VIRTUAL STUDENT SERVICES & ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMING Student-centered, inclusive, co-curricular programs related to recreation, skills-building, internships and community connection will be offered both on campus and online during the fall quarter to ensure a vibrant student community experience. Listed below are links to a variety of virtual student services, remote work opportunities and extracurricular enrichment programming that are currently available to you and will continue in fall. All students have access to the Virtual Student Union at https://www.virtualstudentunion.ucsd.edu a one-stop shop for all student-centered programing. Triton Tools & Tidbits, a new student-produced podcast launched this quarter to support your success, is available at https://shows.acast.com/triton-tools-tidbits All seven colleges offer virtual academic advising at https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/college-contacts/index.html, and The Teaching + Learning Commons provides all academic support services online at https://commons.ucsd.edu/covid-19/students.html Remote student employment options as well as micro-internships have been developed by the Career Center. Information is available through Handshake at https://career.ucsd.edu Students interested in remote internship opportunities abroad should visit https://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/students/programs/index.html#Virtual-Study-Abroad Our Campus Community Centers continue to offer connection, open dialogue and professional skills-building opportunities via virtual formats at https://diversity.ucsd.edu/centers-resources/community-centers.html UC San Diego’s world-class Health System’s Student Health Services is fully operational, providing services both on-campus and remotely at https://wellness.ucsd.edu/studenthealth/Pages/default.aspx The Playground welcomes all campus community members to remotely dance, meditate, compete in e-sports and to create art at https://recreation.ucsd.edu The Basic Needs Hub https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu has partnered with the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/financial-aid to expedite students’ access to federal, state, local and philanthropic gifts. We are proud of our students for continuing to perform well during the changes that have occurred since March. Your determination and strong Triton spirit have made these weeks of transition go smoothly. Thank you for your resilience and continued cooperation. Pradeep K. Khosla Chancellor         836\n"

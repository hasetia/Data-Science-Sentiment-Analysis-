       " 'Dear Texas State Community,  As news continues to evolve about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is understandable there may be concern on our campuses and in our community. I am providing this update to inform you about the precautionary measures being taken at Texas State University. I also want to stress that this is a time for all of us to demonstrate compassion, civility, and personal responsibility as we make the best decisions for our community.  Currently, no cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the Texas State community. However, it is critical to prepare as the situation evolves and more cases are identified in the United States and around the world. The Presidents Cabinet, our Chief Medical Officer Emilio Carranco, M.D., and the universitys Emergency Management Committee will continue to closely monitor the situation and follow federal and state guidelines as we take appropriate precautions.  Stay Informed:  Moving forward, all official university-wide communication about COVID-19 will come via email from Dr. Carranco via the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA) office with the subject line: Coronavirus (COVID19) University Update. The Student Health Center has created a webpage to provide the latest COVID-19 information for our Texas State community.   Travel:   University-approved travel (including study abroad) is prohibited to areas designated Advisory Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or 4 (Do Not Travel) by the United States Department of State, in accordance with The Texas State University System travel policy. We recommend you consult the U.S. Department of State travel advisories, especially as Spring Break is approaching, and take necessary precautions.   Students, faculty, and staff returning from Level 3 designated areas are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. For those not able to quarantine at home, the university has designated a facility as an isolation area. Those returning from Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for 14 days. Dr. Carranco is working with all returning individuals to guide them through the self-quarantine and self-monitoring processes.     Non-official or personal travel to Level 3 and 4 restricted areas is strongly discouraged. Students, faculty, and staff who choose to visit Level 3 and 4 areas will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return. Those traveling to Level 1 or 2 designated areas are instructed to self-monitor for signs of illness. This is for the protection of everyone in our community.   The university will continue to monitor U. S. Department of State travel advisories and remain in close contact with students, faculty, and staff in study abroad and non-study abroad programs.  Protecting yourself and our community:   We all have a responsibility to maintain the health and wellbeing of our community by following recommended respiratory hygiene practices and not exposing others to contagious illnesses.  If you feel sick, stay home from classes or work. Students who are ill and need to be absent from class should contact the Dean of Students office at (512) 245-2124. Faculty and staff should notify their supervisors. In addition, we urge you to follow these prevention guidelines to limit exposure to illness.   As we focus on our Texas State community, it is also important to remember everyone around the world impacted by COVID-19. Avoid stereotyping or stigmatizing any individuals or groups and follow our Bobcat values, including treating all with respect and dignity.   We will continue to monitor this situation and provide you with periodic updates. The health and wellbeing of every member of our Texas State family remains our top priority, and we will continue to take all necessary precautions.     Sincerely,     Denise M.

       " ' The City of San Marcos in coordination with Hays County, Texas State University, Congressman Lloyd Doggetts office, local school districts, regional and state agencies, met Wednesday, Mar. 4 to coordinate and discuss efforts underway to address Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).   While COVID-19 is not an immediate threat to our community as no cases of the virus have been confirmed in Hays County at this time, we are partnering with county-wide organizations and state public health officials to monitor trends and prepare our organizations and residents, said Rachel Ingle, the Citys Emergency Management Coordinator.    From todays Hays County press release, Hays County Local Health Department Epidemiologist Eric Schneider explained how the public can take preventative measures to protect themselves and their families against illness. Essentially, they are the same healthy behaviors that can prevent a flu outbreak:   Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds several times a day, including between your fingers and underneath your nails. Handwashing is considered the best way to remove germs and dirt, and hand sanitizers should be used only when handwashing is not available. The hand sanitizers should be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective.  Avoid handshaking and high-fives;  Avoid touching your face  especially your eyes, nose, and mouth; Stay home when you feel sick; Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue then put the tissue in the trash, or use the crook of your elbow if a tissue isnt available;  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household disinfectant cleaning spray or wipe. Clean cell and desk phones, computer keyboards, door handles, and work surfaces often. Face masks are not considered an effective way to prevent someone from catching a virus unless you have close, frequent contact with a sick person; however, they are an option for sick people to use to keep from spreading the virus; Avoid travel to areas that have been designated high-risk areas because of multiple verified cases of COVID-19.  The public should note that Coronaviruses are not new  some are responsible for common colds and some for more serious infections like SARS  but this particular strain of the virus is new which is why it is often referred to as Novel Coronavirus. Its formal name is Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) since 2019 was the year it was discovered.  As of March 5, no cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Hays County, and only a few individuals who believe they may have been exposed to a confirmed case are in self-quarantine and are being monitored as a precaution to protect our community, Schneider said. While we are anticipating cases to eventually show up in Hays County, the first line of defense against an outbreak or community spreading is to follow good health practices whether you are healthy or feeling sick.   Contact your healthcare provider or the Hays County Local Health Department at 512-393-5520 if you have any questions about COVID-19 or if you are concerned that you have been exposed.  The Hays County Health Department has a monitoring protocol in place which will be explained to you if warranted.  If you are experiencing symptoms, you may be directed to your local hospital emergency room.   For additional qualified information about COVID-19, visit the Texas Department of State Health Services or the Centers for Disease Control.

       " ' Dear University Community,   As new cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerge and our university community prepares for spring break, I want to share some expanded travel restrictions and important updates to safeguard our faculty, staff, and students.   As a reminder, we have launched a COVID-19 webpage as a source for critical and updated information.  Please check your Texas State email and the website to stay informed.  Situation Update   As of this date, no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported on our San Marcos or Round Rock Campuses, or in Hays County or Williamson County.  Education Abroad Programs   Effective immediately, all Education Abroad programs for spring break and summer are being cancelled.  We will continue to assess future programs as the situation evolves. The university is working to provide alternate options for students registered for the cancelled Education Abroad trips.     If you enrolled in an Education Abroad program that is being cancelled and you have questions, please call the Education Abroad Office at 512-245-1967 for assistance.  Students in Education Abroad programs in countries with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designated Travel Warning Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) have already been recalled and required to self-isolate for 14 days.   Faculty, Staff, and Student International Travel   University-affiliated international travel by faculty, staff, and students to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 is restricted. Approval for official university international travel for faculty, staff, and students will be evaluated on an individual case basis at the Presidents Cabinet level.    Faculty, staff, and students who choose to travel for personal reasons to countries with a CDC Travel Warning Level 2 or 3 will be required to self-isolate for 14 days before returning to a Texas State campus.  If a countrys warning level increases to a CDC Level 2 or 3 during the visit, the faculty, staff member, or student will also be required to self-isolate before returning to campus.  Check CDC Travel Warnings for the  latest information.  Class/Work Absence Due to Illness   Providing a healthy, safe working, and learning environment is a priority.  It is essential that faculty, staff or students who have a potentially contagious illness stay home and not go to class or work.  Persons who appear ill and have symptoms such as cough, fever, and sneezing will be asked to leave the workplace or classroom.  Students who miss class due to illness should contact the Dean of Students office (phone: 512-245-2124) and work with their professors to discuss how to manage course work while absent.  Faculty and staff who miss work due to illness should follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.  Self-Isolation Requirements   Faculty, staff or students required to self-isolate must follow the CDCs guidance for effective and safe isolation (How to Self-Isolate).  Self-isolation may be required by a public health authority or a medical provider.  A medical note verifying the need for isolation must be provided upon return to school or work.  Faculty or staff required by a public health authority or a medical provider to self-isolate will follow the established university policy for notifying supervisors and using sick leave.  Personal Health and Safety   As COVID-19 continues to spread both in the U.S. and abroad, it is important that you carefully consider where you are travelling.  Avoid areas where there is evidence of COVID-19 spreading.  Practice effective prevention measures such as staying away from those that are sick, washing your hands frequently, and staying home if you are ill.  If we work together and follow the guidance provided, we can help protect our Bobcat community.  For the latest information on COVID-19 and the universitys response measures, please check TXST COVID-19. .     Sincerely,  Denise M. Trauth  President',\n",

Updated information has been provided to faculty and staff regarding leave, telecommuting, K-12 school and daycare closures, insurance, and resources for supervisors.  Reminders    Texas State has extended spring break for students for students through March 27. Organized seminars, lectures and laboratory courses will move to remote delivery beginning March 30 and ending April 12.   Persons returning from countries with a CDC Level 2 or 3 Travel Warning will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.

       " 'Dear Texas State Community,   COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States but there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Texas State campuses at this time.  The university has implemented a variety of measures to decrease the risk of exposure to our community.  International and domestic travel have been restricted.  We have increased infection control.  We are implementing social distancing. For a list of cancelled events, click here. We are sharing information about prevention, proper self-isolation, and safely seeking medical care.  Slowing the spread of COVID-19 requires that we all do our part by staying home if sick, practicing social distancing and following the instructions of our healthcare providers.   Travel is a significant concern, especially as spring break ends.  I want to remind our campus community about the following travel policies:   Persons returning from countries with a CDC Level 2 or 3 Travel Health Notice are required to self-isolate for 14 days before coming to a Texas State campus.  International travelers should send an email to healthcenter@txstate.edu with information about travel destination(s) and dates of travel so that we can monitor your health and provide you with medical documentation.  Information on how to self-isolate can be found at Steps for Isolating.    Persons traveling within the United States, especially to areas with community transmission such as Washington, California and New York state, should self-monitor and social distance for 14 days.  Temperature should be checked in the morning and afternoon daily.  Signs of illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath should be assessed daily.  Social distancing should be practiced by avoiding crowds and maintaining some distance with others while at home or work as much as  possible.  If an illness develops during the self-monitoring period, stay home and consult with your healthcare provider by phone.  The Student Health Center is introducing Telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our patients and staff.  All patients requesting an appointment for evaluation of a respiratory illness will  have  a Telehealth visit with a medical provider first.  The medical provider may be able to provide care and treatment without a personal visit or may determine that the patient needs to come to the Health Center for further evaluation and testing.  COVID-19 testing is still limited and can only be conducted if criteria are met for testing.  Faculty, staff and students are eligible for COVID-19 testing if within the last 14 days they had:  1) direct contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or 2) recent international or domestic travel to an area with community transmission of COVID-19 and develop fever (> 100F), cough and shortness of breath.  To request an appointment, call the Student Health Center at 512-245-2161.  For more information about COVID-19, check the CDC website at Coronavirus 2019.

       " 'Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,   This is a difficult time for all of us, and it requires me to share information that I know will have a tremendous impact on our Texas State University family. To protect our students, faculty, and staff from the ongoing spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), the decision has been made to move courses to remote or alternative delivery beginning March 30 through the end of the spring semester.     Members of my Cabinet, other key university administrators, and I considered every aspect of this unprecedented decision and what it would mean for our students, but in the end, out of the utmost concern for everyones safety and health we reached this conclusion.   Ensuring students can easily access their remote course material is our primary focus. All undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to complete the courses for which they are currently enrolled.  We will work to find solutions for students without off-campus access to a computer or Wi-Fi. Students who have questions or need support can contact the IT Assistant Center (ITAC).  In  accordance with national and state recommendations on social distancing, we request our students living in residence halls or in Bobcat Village Apartments return home or make other off-campus living arrangements for the remainder of the spring semester. We realize moving out of a residence hall is not an option for everyone, and are committed to being flexible for special considerations. Those who need to remain on campus will have limited access to services and facilities, such as the  LBJ Student Center and dining options. Clearly, there will be fewer opportunities for interaction due to the need for social distancing and thus the cancellation of university events and activities. The Department of Housing and Residential Life will communicate directly with on-campus residents about how to apply for an exception to remain on-campus, establish a time to retrieve belongings and move out, and the process for receiving a financial credit for housing costs.  For  Bobcats planning to graduate in May, I know you are concerned about spring commencement ceremonies. We are moving spring ceremonies to August 6 and 8 to coincide with summer commencement. An updated schedule of those ceremonies will be available soon here.  I am so proud of our students graduating in May, and look forward to celebrating that achievement with you and your families in August. It is important to remember if you are eligible to graduate at the end of this spring semester, you will still receive your degree and a diploma even if you are not able to participate in the rescheduled commencement ceremonies.   Understandably, these developments will generate many questions from our students regarding course completion and credit, access to technology you need to learn and work remotely, and housing options. Our Texas State faculty and staff are prepared to make the transition as smooth as possible and are here to help you navigate the process. We will continue to share detailed information as we respond to COVID-19. To stay informed, check your university email often, and visit the COVID-19 webpage for the most recent updates and helpful FAQs.   I am extremely grateful for our Texas State staff and faculty who have worked tirelessly to support our university community, and who will help us overcome the challenges ahead. I know their work is done out of dedication to and love for our Bobcat students.   These are extraordinary times that call on the best of our Bobcat spirit, grit, compassion, and determination. I am proud to be a part of this amazing community, and your safety and well-being will continue to be my highest priority.   Be well Bobcats.     Sincerely,  Denise M. Trauth  President',\n",
       " ' Dear Colleagues,  Every day, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 bring new challenges and decisions for us to face professionally and personally. I have seen you all meet these difficult times with perseverance, creativity, hard work, and sincere care and empathy for our students. I have never been prouder.   To  enable Texas State University employees to comply with shelter-in-place or other restrictions that may be issued by local or state officials, we are providing the following guidance regarding managing your work schedule.    We  recognize these shelter-in-place restrictions may eventually affect many, if not all, of our employees and students.  Texas State is committed to providing flexibility and appropriate work options that not only answer the needs of our employees, but ensure the continued operation of the university.  These extraordinary times require us to provide additional support to our students as they adapt to their changing learning and living environment. It is critical that the students on our campuses and those working remotely have access to the services and facilities they need to be successful.   The  Presidents Cabinet has reviewed the essential offices previously identified for energy conservation and weather emergencies and adjusted the list for this situation. To meet the universitys needs, we have determined that offices identified as essential to university operations (listed at the end of this email) must have at least one full-time employee in the office on the San Marcos Campus, and as applicable, on the Round Rock Campus, during the normal 40-hour work week. The appropriate cabinet member may determine if more individuals are needed to perform the necessary work responsibilities.  All  other employees not physically on one of the campuses are expected to work remotely for 40 hours per week.  The expectation is that anyone working remotely is reachable, available, and demonstrating work outcomes. These individuals must submit the Remote and Telecommuting Work Agreement and have it approved by their supervisor. I encourage you to review the Staff and Faculty section here on the COVID-19 webpage for important information on working remotely.  We  understand that some employees for various reasons may not be able to work remotely from home. In those cases, they should plan to come to their office on our campuses and follow the work schedule as approved by their supervisor while maintaining the recommended social distancing protocol. Supervisors can also approve flexible work hours (e.g., early mornings, late evenings, and/or weekends) to accommodate our employees professional and personal needs. Temporary staff and student employees, including those on assistantships and work-study appointments, may also be extended the option to perform work from home.   As a  reminder, university mail services will continue to operate for the remainder of the semester on the spring break schedule outlined here in the Campus Services and Support section of the COVID-19 FAQs.   Thank you for your continued patience as we work to find the best solutions to keep our Texas State community safe and operational. I appreciate each and every one of you.  Sincerely,     Denise M. Trauth  President',\n",

Texas State President Denise Trauth provided information to employees via email on March 24 regarding university essential offices and functions.  Beginning  March 30, Texas State courses are moving to remote or alternative delivery through the end of the spring semester.  In accordance  with national recommendations on social distancing, students living in university residence halls have been asked to return home for the rest of the semester.

We will continue to provide services to the more than 38,000 students enrolled in courses and to our students who continue to live on the San Marcos campus.   Texas State has been preparing for this possibility by adjusting our remote work and telecommuting policies, encouraging flexible work schedules, revising our list of essential university offices, and working to support our employees who will be working on-site and remotely during this time.  I  encourage you to read the shelter-in-place information posted on the Faculty and Staff COVID-19 FAQ page which is being continuously updated as new information is available.

The order includes a curfew from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m., except for essential workers whose employment requires it. Exceptions are made for essential services and businesses. We encourage you to read the statement from Hays County. The full order is available here. Williamson County, which includes our Round Rock Campus, is also under a similar Stay At Home order.

       " ' Dear Colleagues,    As we prepare to welcome back our students to the completion of the spring semester through remote and alternate delivery methods, I want to thank you all for your leadership during this time of unprecedented challenge.  I am very proud of the dedication you have shown to our students and each other as we have made difficult decisions to protect our community.  Now as the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more apparent, we must prepare for the reality that the events attendant to the virus will have an impact on our financial future.   I  strongly believe that we are doing the right thing by changing our traditional campus life to allow students to complete their courses from the safety of their homes.  The health of our students, faculty, and staff will continue to be my highest priority.  We know that these decisions will result in a loss of already budgeted funds, and it is in this context that we also must prepare for the additional financial losses we could experience in the coming weeks and months.   We  anticipate that our summer enrollment will be significantly less than in previous years, and that fall enrollment could also be negatively impacted.  It is prudent that we act now to conserve our resources for the future.  By acting quickly, we hope to be able to continue to provide the best possible educational environment for our students and to protect our employees.      Therefore, I have asked my Cabinet to implement the following changes to our budgets. We will temporarily delay all new personnel actions including the posting of new positions and hiring to fill vacancies.  Certain exceptions will be allowed, such as the Vice President for Student Affairs, which I consider a critical position.  Requests for exceptions will be reviewed by the appropriate Cabinet member and require my approval.     For the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends on August 31, 2020, I am restricting expenditures from operating budgets to 50 percent of the remaining balances.  The remaining 50 percent of the funds will be placed into savings accounts in your own budgets to provide a safety net in case these funds are needed in the next fiscal year .      Currently, all university sponsored travel is cancelled.  This policy will remain in effect until health experts indicate it is safe to travel.  We know that many faculty members are planning to submit papers and proposals for delivery at academic conferences.  Assuming the lifting of shelter-in-place restrictions, faculty members can make submissions for conferences beginning with the next academic year.  Other travelers must receive an exception given by the appropriate Cabinet member .     Since it is imperative for everyone to exercise tight fiscal controls on expenditures, additional cost savings measures in the area of facility construction have been identified and these include the delay of any renovations, improvement projects, or optional facility projects until the next fiscal year.  However, continued enhanced cleaning and routine facility repairs will be conducted as needed.      I  know that you will have many questions regarding how these changes will be implemented, and I have asked Provost Gene Bourgeois and Vice President for Finance and Support Services Eric Algoe to provide further details in the coming days.      These changes will undoubtedly cause hardships and difficulty across our campuses, and I sincerely hope that many of the cost-saving measures will prove to be unnecessary in the months to come.  However, we would be remiss in our responsibilities as leaders if we do not act now.  The extraordinary challenges created by COVID-19 demand unprecedented fiscal discipline.  I will continue to keep you updated as we address this evolving situation .  ',\n",

Texas State University leadership is making important decisions to prioritize the health and well-being of the Bobcat Community, while continuing the essential work of running a university.

No matter where you are today, know that our Bobcat community remains strong, and all of  us at Texas State University are invested in your success as we adapt to a new learning environment.    As we begin classes under stay-at-home orders from Hays County, Williamson County, and  surrounding counties, I want to emphasize that Texas State is considered an essential government agency and remains open with limited staffing to serve you. Many of our employees are working remotely, while others are practicing social distancing to keep essential offices operating on our campuses. Adhering to the stay-at-home orders is critical for the health and safety of our entire region and I encourage you to read our COVID-19 FAQs for updates and information on available services while the orders are in place.  I am very proud of how our dedicated faculty and staff have met the challenge of moving  over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery over the last two weeks. They faced this task with innovation, hard work, and determination to serve you well during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that you can easily access your remote course material and finish the semester strong is our primary focus.

This challenging situation has amplified our fundamental Bobcat values of compassion, service, perseverance, and dedication. I am humbled by the actions of our health professions faculty and staff who have donated their time and equipment, including loaning ventilators to area hospitals, to help the greater cause. Our Student Affairs and Housing and Residential Life staff are working hard to help 4,000 students move from residence halls safely, or find a way to stay if they didnt have a suitable housing alternative. The Student Health Center transformed its health care delivery to include a telehealth to keep students well. Our alumni have reached out to offer encouragement and support to the university and to our students. Through kindness and hard work, our university family is making a difference, and I look forward to sharing more of these uplifting stories in the upcoming days and weeks.  Most importantly, I am impressed by each of you. I know there is apprehension and uncertainty along with disappointment for what you are missing, but I am confident in your resilience and tenacity. We are here to give you the support you need to navigate these next two months. And, for those of you who are seniors, I cant wait to celebrate commencement with you in August.  Together, we will make the best of this situation, and give new meaning to Bobcat Strong.  Stay safe and well.     Sincerely,  Denise M. Trauth  President',\n",
       " 'Dear Colleagues,  In the midst of this incredibly difficult experience we have navigated together, you - our amazing faculty and staff -- have been a constant reminder of the strength, compassion, resilience, and determination that thrives in our Bobcat family. I want to express my deepest gratitude to each of you for all your work over the last few weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   For more than a century, our university community has been united by the belief  that through our love of learning and our hard work, we can do great things. There is no better example than the many ways that faculty and staff are meeting these challenging times with creativity, cooperation, and a deep commitment to our students.  Every division, department, college, and program -- on both campuses -- have  moved quickly to adapt our operations in the face of great difficulty and ever-changing circumstances.   Once we announced the decision to transition to remote instruction, staff in  several parts of the university immediately established a comprehensive set of workshops and consultations to ensure faculty were effectively supported for the transition. Faculty responded quickly, converting over 5,200 class sections of lecture, seminar, and laboratory courses to remote delivery. Academic departments, schools, and colleges are also providing training and other support services for faculty, and adopting new tools and technology to shift to remote instruction. Our IT personnel have provided support, troubleshooting, training, and new resources to help make the transition as smooth as possible.  University-wide, departments and programs are being creative and finding ways  to share their services remotely and stay connected with our students. The Student Health Center launched telehealth services to increase access to healthcare and to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to our students, faculty, and staff. Our custodians have gone above and beyond to disinfect some of the most high-traffic areas of our campuses to promote our health and wellness. Many of you have been go-to sources of information and expertise for reporters, students, and fellow academics regarding the pandemic and its impact on society. I also applaud the work of Academic Affairs, planning the logistics of moving more than 5,000 soon-to-be graduates from our May commencement ceremonies into August ceremonies. There are countless stories to tell about the hard work that has taken place here -- stories we plan to share far and wide in the coming weeks.  While all this work has been happening behind-the-scenes, everyone in our Bobcat  community has juggled the needs of their loved ones, families, friends, and children. Many of you have children who are out of school, or parents and family members who are elderly or have preexisting medical conditions. All of this brings added fear and anxiety into our Bobcat community. I want to take a moment to recognize how difficult it has been for everyone, and thank you for your contributions during this trying time. Youve worked hard to stay student-centered and I am incredibly grateful for your support and dedication.  Its also important to recognize the critical work of people outside our university but integral in our community -- healthcare workers, civil service employees, sanitation workers, first responders, journalists, grocery workers, nonprofit workers and volunteers, military personnel, utility workers, and mail carriers. Many people in our university community have loved ones who have worked around-the-clock in these essential roles. We owe them a debt of gratitude as well.  Today, I also sent a message to all of our students to reiterate we are here to support them as they navigate the rest of this semester, and to remind them of services that remain available thanks to the hard work and creativity of our staff and faculty.  The  university has shared several messages with you over the last week pertaining to what the recent stay-at-home orders mean for university operations, how public universities are required to remain open with limited on-campus staffing, and staffing for essential offices. If you have any questions, I encourage you to speak with your supervisor.   While  many of you are continuing your daily work remotely, we know there are employees whose jobs and responsibilities require them to be on-campus. To express our gratitude, we are providing a free to-go lunch daily on both campuses. Look for an email from Dining Services for all the details on how to enjoy a delicious and convenient meal every day that you are on campus.  In closing, please know I share this message of thanks on behalf of the entire Presidents Cabinet. We are all moving into uncharted territory together, but because of the caliber of our faculty and staff, I know that we will continue to provide a top-tier education and student experience, while living up to our values. Thats what makes Texas State so special.     Sincerely,     Denise M. Trauth  President',\n",
       " '  Today, the university learned that a  faculty member in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19.  The faculty member became ill during spring break on 3/17/20 while away from the San Marcos university campus. Subsequently, the individual was seen by a primary care provider who later confirmed a positive COVID-19 test result.  The faculty member, who lives in Austin, is recovering well and a full recovery is expected.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials.    The faculty member was on campus on March 9th and 11th before the universitys spring break.  The faculty member was completely asymptomatic while on campus.  After consulting with the local public health authority, it has been determined that the risk of transmission to others on March 9th and 11th was very low.  Since the faculty member has not returned to campus since March 11th, and it is past the 14-day incubation period, the public health authority is not recommending any specific measures be taken by the university at this time.    As COVID-19 continues to spread across  our country, it is important that everyone follow local directives for social distancing or shelter-in-place, and adhere to CDC guidance on prevention measures such as staying away from those who are sick, washing hands frequently - especially before touching your face or eating, and staying home if ill.  These are difficult times and I hope all are healthy and safe. Lets keep doing our part to stop the spread of COVID-19. ',\n",
       " 'Bobcats, we know you are excited to register for summer and fall 2020 courses.

       " 'As part of  the transition to remote instruction for the spring 2020 semester, Texas State University will make a temporary change to the final grades policy. This change will provide students with the option to request modification of final course grades to the EP (emergency pass) grades. The modification request may only be utilized for courses in which the student earned a passing grade. See the University Registrars definition of grades: https://www.registrar.txstate.edu/our-services/grades.html.  The decision  to allow this flexibility is in direct response to the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19. The universitys remote courses will continue to maintain the highest quality standards. Students are expected to participate in class activities, assessments, and assignments throughout the remainder of the semester. As usual, faculty members will assign final grades to students using the criteria and performance standards outlined for the course.   Once final  spring 2020 semester grades are posted, students will have until Monday, May 25, 2020 to submit a written modification request to their professor(s) requesting an EP grade. Upon approval, the professor will make the grade change. To be considered, all requests must be made in writing to the professor by the stated deadline. The modification request option is limited to spring 2020 courses only. Students make requests on a course-by-course basis.  Students are  encouraged to consider the consequences of an EP grade, including those for prerequisite course requirements, GPA calculations, GPA minimums for certain programs, academic standing, admission to other programs or universities, financial aid, veterans benefits, scholarships, and other academic matters. Students should contact their academic advisor or academic program coordinator for specific questions. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to consult with their graduate advisor about the impacts of an EP grade before seeking a modification request.  Faculty members  are encouraged to be flexible but have the authority to make their own decisions on these requests. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/.  Students may appeal  a faculty members decision using the procedures outlined for the department, school, or college in which the course is taught. The appeal process is applicable for all grades, including those under review by this temporary change to the final grades policy.  I realize this has not  been an easy transition and thank you for your patience and understanding as we assess options and make decisions in the best interest of the university community.',\n",
       " 'Laboratory-based  science is an important component of our research mission at Texas State University.  Circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic now require us to work together to temporarily restrict access to laboratories on the Texas State campuses for the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students, and to comply with the stay-at-home directives now in place throughout Central Texas.  On March 27 we shared some initial guidance, and now we are providing information on implementing the restriction.   The Stay-at-Home/Work  Safe order issue by Hays County and Williamson County prevents individuals from leaving their homes except for purposes of essential activities or to perform or obtain services from an essential business, essential governmental function, or critical infrastructure.  Regarding universities, there is language allowing for essential activities that include performing critical research, or performing essential administrative functions.  Based on these orders all university research laboratories at Texas State are restricted from access except for individuals performing essential tasks.  Understandably there are questions as to what constitutes essential research activities. First, all research at Texas State is important so that alone is not the benchmark for defining essential.  Also, it is true that a pause in routine research activity will have consequences regarding collection of data, publication of research results, and other usual benchmarks of progress.  So, while very unfortunate, a disruption of these types of outcomes is not synonymous with essential in the present context.     It is impossible to provide a definition of essential that will cover the unique circumstances  for all research activities at Texas State.  One example of performing an essential function is an individual who enters a research laboratory for a brief visit to assure that there are no issues related to the equipment or other components of the facility.  This is very different from going into the facility to conduct experiments and collect data which, in general, would not be considered an essential activity.  In rare cases, a more ongoing activity may be approved as essential (see below).  For the duration of the stay-at-home orders and other precautions in place related to the  coronavirus outbreak, the goal is to have an intentional change in activity from a business as usual mode to focusing only on critical functions in the laboratory.   So, without trying to be fully inclusive or exclusive, research laboratory access is limited to  a very small number of personnel who maintain essential research-related actions that include:  performing a brief walk-through of the laboratory to make sure that everything is OK. activity that if discontinued immediately would generate significant data and sample loss. activity that if discontinued would pose a safety hazard. activity that keeps critical equipment and infrastructure in facilities and laboratories safe or avoids catastrophic loss. activity that maintains critical samples, reagents, and materials. activity that maintains animal populations. activity that maintains critically-needed plant populations, tissue cultures, bacteria, archaea, and other living organisms. COVID-19 related activity that has a timeline for deployment that could address the crisis. activity in support of essential human subjects research. Also, as we have indicated in previous communications, students cannot be compelled to participate in research laboratory-based activities, even those identified as essential.  In no case may there be academic or professional retribution against students who decide not to participate in such activities during this time.  Please act immediately to transition laboratories to restricted access.  The restricted access mode should  be fully in place by Monday, April 6.  If any essential activity is planned beyond intermittent brief walk-throughs, you will need approval of the planned activity from Dr. Michael Blanda, Assistant Vice President for Research, who will review requests in conjunction with the Chief Research Officer.  Please contact Dr. Blanda via email at blanda@txstate.edu.  Thank you for your understanding and leadership during these unprecedented circumstances.',\n",
       " 'I  hope everyone is doing well and adapting to remote and alternative course delivery for the spring semester. Texas State University is here to support our current and future Bobcats during this time of disruption. Im pleased to announce today that we are providing emergency financial aid and adjusting the delivery of Summer I courses to better meet your needs during the COVID-19 crisis.  To  make summer 2020 courses at Texas State as accessible as possible while ensuring the continued safety of our students, faculty, and staff, we will move scheduled class sections that start meeting at any point in June to online/remote delivery, and return to face-to-face and online classroom delivery for the Summer II session (July 6 - August 5). Please note that the decision regarding the Summer II session could change according to public health advice and conditions.  Making the  decision now to move Summer I to online/remote delivery gives you the ability to plan accordingly for the future during these still uncertain times, and allows students to continue toward reaching their educational goals.  I want to be  clear: Summer courses are not canceled, only moved to online/remote delivery for the Summer I session.  Registration for the Summer and Fall 2020 semesters will open on April 6, 2020.  Here is what you need to know about moving Summer I courses to online/remote delivery:  Financial aid  processing is not directly affected. Remember: The Pell Grant is available for summer classes based on student eligibility. Students will be awarded emergency financial aid of $50 per semester credit hour.

       " 'Let me begin by  acknowledging the tremendous efforts by our faculty, staff, and students in making the first week of remote instruction a success.  As we end this historic week, I wanted to answer several questions, highlight resources, and provide reassurance that the university is here to support you every step of the way.  Academic Freedom  Texas State University  affirms its commitment to academic freedom and will take steps to ensure intellectual independence, free investigation, and unfettered communication by the academic community.  President Trauth and I reaffirmed this commitment at our monthly PAAG meeting with Faculty Senate a few days ago.  Through our core values, Texas State protects and celebrates academic freedom in an atmosphere of integrity, respect, civility, and compassion.  Faculty Senates Academic Freedom Committee provides more information on this fundamental tenet in higher education: https://www.txstate.edu/facultysenate/committees/freedom.html.  Academic Integrity  With the sudden transition  to remote instruction, many faculty are concerned about ensuring academic integrity in the new environment.  Fortunately, the university has several options for gaining more information, including the video, Prompt Preparation for 100% Online Instruction and the University Honor Code, a 15-minute guide to proactively influence academic integrity in an online course.  In conjunction with the Honor Code Council, Faculty Development will offer a workshop and Q&A period, Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, on Wednesday, April 8, 2020 from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. via Zoom.  Go here to learn more and sign up for this interactive session: https://signup.txstate.edu/sessions/6035-4-8-2020-their-cheating-hearts-tips-for-maintaining-academic-integrity-while-teaching-remotely.   Classroom Recordings  Faculty members have asked  about posting the recordings of online class sessions where student participation occurred.  These recordings reflect the teaching and learning process, so instructors often post them for students to watch or re-watch.  If access to the recordings is securely limited to other students in the same class section, student privacy protections do not limit or prevent access and do not require obtaining a written consent.  Faculty may post these recordings in TRACS or Canvas class sites that are protected by student identification and authentication features.  The recordings may not be distributed by anyone, including students, to third-parties without obtaining written consent from the instructor, students, and other participants.  Community of Practice  Every Friday at 12:00 noon Faculty Development is hosting Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty members to visit, exchange ideas, and find ways to take care of each other, ourselves, and our students as we navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning.  Topics are based on faculty suggestions.  The topic for Friday, April 3, 2020 is We Made It! This come-and-go Zoom session is time to share what is working in your classes and to hear ideas on best practices for surviving and thriving in this new learning environment.  This lunchtime gathering will be informal, informative, and fun.

See more information on copyright provisions and a suggested written statement to students (section 03.01) in AA/PPS 02.03.01, Commercial Use of Class Notes and Materials.  Additional information on copyright and remote teaching is available from the universitys Copyright Office and the librarys remote course support webpage.   Finding Time to Read, Write, and Think  If faculty are trying to carve out  space for thinking, reading, writing, and other deep work, join Faculty Developments new program, Write Watchers. The group will meet via Zoom every Tuesday, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon, beginning on April 7, 2020.  In a Write Watcher session, each participant sets goals at the beginning and then reflects on what was accomplished at the end. In between, microphones are muted and faculty do deep work, with other supportive faculty working alongside them.  To join, follow this Zoom link on Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m.:https://txstate.zoom.us/my/writewatchers.  Zoom-bombing  A few faculty members have  reported instances of Zoom-bombing, where an uninvited person accesses and disrupts a Zoom class session, often using inappropriate language and graphics. Visit ITACs helpful resource on how to lockdown Zoom sessions to avoid unwanted visitors: https://itac.txstate.edu/support/online-meetings/lockdown.html.  Remember the first rule of Zoom: Dont give up control of your screen.   Next week, I will provide updates  on other questions, including those related to EP grades, professional development requirements for faculty teaching online this summer, the employee assistance program, student evaluations of teaching, and the tenure clock for tenure-track faculty. Until then, I hope you and your loved ones are well. ',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,   Today the university learned that a student in our Texas State University community tested positive for COVID-19 on March 30, 2020.  The student came back to campus with a parent to move out of the residence hall on March 27, 2020.  The student was asymptomatic at that time and did not have close contact with anyone other than the parent.  The student has had only mild symptoms thus far and we hope for a quick and complete recovery.  Out of respect for the individuals privacy, we are only sharing identifying information with public health officials.   The  Department of Housing and Residential Life developed a phased move-out process as a social distancing measure to reduce the risk of close or prolonged contact between persons during the move-out process.  Since the student was asymptomatic and had no close contact with anyone on campus besides the mother, the risk of exposure to others was very low.  It has been determined that no particular actions are necessary at this time.  However, this notice is being sent to comply with the requirements of the Clery Act.  Under  the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), institutions are required to immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation occurring on the campus that involves an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees. The Clery Act includes the outbreak of a serious illness as a significant emergency. Although this specific case does not rise to the level of significant emergency, the university is erring on the side of caution and acting in the spirit of the Clery Act.  Consistent with guidance from the Department of Education, Texas State will carefully analyze any subsequent or additional COVID-19 incidents on a case-by-case basis and will issue additional reports only if other significant factors call for a follow-up notification.

       " 'As we end our second week of remote instruction, this message provides responses to feedback and questions received by my office on matters related to Texas States COVID-19 response. This weeks roundup begins with four decisions that were made after consulting the Faculty Senate and academic leadership.  EP Grades The university has implemented a one-time process for spring 2020 that allows students to request that a final passing grade be changed to Emergency Pass, or EP, upon approval of the instructor of record. Students are responsible for submitting written modification requests to faculty by Monday, May 25, at 5:00 p.m. and for assessing the impact of EP grades on their GPAs, program requirements, financial aid eligibility, and other academic factors. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/. Faculty are encouraged to check with their chair or director for any questions regarding EP grades. Information resources include the provosts March 31, 2020 email and FAQ for students.  Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online The Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL), along with staff in Information Technology (ITAC) and Faculty Development, will support faculty re-designing courses for distance learning for the summer I term. AA/PPS No. 02.03.20 Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program. By mid-April, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from ODEL about how to access the program.  Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in professional development for online instruction. For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program. Questions may be directed to the Office of Distance and Extended Learning at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceed@txstate.edu.   Student Evaluations of Teaching Weve received questions about the effect of remote instruction and other changes on student evaluations of teaching for spring 2020 courses. Faculty will have the discretion to include or exclude spring 2020 results in their annual evaluation documents and tenure and promotion files, without prejudice. Faculty, chairs, directors, personnel committees, and other evaluators are encouraged to review spring 2020 student evaluation of teaching results for the purposes of professional growth. This is an opportune time to reinforce a long-term and holistic assessment of teaching effectiveness via peer observations, student learning outcomes, artifacts of learning, philosophy of teaching statements, syllabi review, and other means.  Tenure Clock for Tenure-Track Faculty The COVID-19 pandemic has created circumstances that may impact productivity of tenure-track faculty who have a mandatory and limited probationary period before the tenure and promotion decision. These circumstances may warrant a request to toll the tenure clock. See section 03.01.g of AA/PPS, 04.02.20, Tenure and Promotion Review for more information. The policy is being updated to reflect these circumstances, as well.  Tenure-track faculty are advised to consult with their chair, director, and others before making a request to toll the tenure clock. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure and promotion review is scheduled for the next academic year (FY21) may make a request no later than May 31, 2020. Faculty members whose mandatory tenure review occurs in FY22 or later have until May 31, 2021 to make a request. The request memo originates with the faculty member and requires approval by the chair/director, dean, provost, and vice chancellor for academic and health affairs at the Texas State University System. Contact Tammy Sharp, director, faculty and academic resources, for more information: tsharp@txstate.edu or 512.245.2475.  Academic Integrity  In response to strong faculty interest, Texas State held a workshop on academic integrity in remote instruction earlier this week. See Their Cheating Hearts: Tips for Maintaining Academic Integrity While Teaching Remotely, including an extensive Q&A session, here: https://mediaflo.txstate.edu/hapi/v1/contents/permalinks/Dm43NrZi/view. Closed captioning is enabled for the video.  Community of Practice  Over the past few weeks, faculty have sought ways to stay connected, move projects forward, and strengthen professional relationships. Make plans to join Lets Do Lunch, an opportunity for faculty to exchange ideas about ways to navigate this new world of remote teaching and learning and Write Watchers to carve out time and space for thinking, reading, writing, and other completing deep work.  Employee Assistance Program  Bobcat Balance  The university offers a comprehensive set of employee assistance services through the Bobcat Balance program. All faculty, staff and graduate student employees in benefits-eligible positions, along with members of their households, are eligible to use the program. The program includes resources and services related to personal finances, child care, elder care, legal matters, health and wellness, and other areas. Please explore this valuable employee benefit.  Supporting Students During Uncertain Times  Many students feel especially vulnerable at this time. Beyond changes to instruction, some students have moved back home, lost jobs, or are caring for young children and family members. The College Transition Collaborative provides advice on communicating with students with clarity and compassion. Texas States Counseling Center has a COVID-19 resource page, including a webinar on April 17, 2020 to support student resilience and success.   Next Friday, I will provide updates on questions and decisions that emerge during our third week of remote instruction. Keep up the outstanding work!

My office has received many compliments on how well our faculty and staff are supporting students, and each other, to ensure a healthy and successful spring semester for all.  I could not be prouder of the unprecedented collaboration and community spirit that is alive and well at Texas State.  WellCats: Live. Work. Be Well.   This week, I want to highlight the Texas State wellness program, WellCats, that was developed in 2015 by four Texas State faculty members.  Today, WellCats is a nationally recognized, evidenced-based, comprehensive employee program designed to inspire Texas State employees and the community to enhance wellness.  WellCats focuses on the eight dimensions of wellness, including nutrition, physical, social, and emotional well-being. Join now to learn more about this inspiring program.   Between now and May 9, 2020, WellCats and Campus Recreation are advertising live and on-demand exercise sessions.  Learn more about these sessions here: https://www.campusrecreation.txstate.edu/fitness/Group-Exercise/Fitness-From-Home.html.  For questions regarding WellCats and the Bobcat Balance program profiled last week, please contact Rose Trevino or Josh Arguelles via email at worklife@txstate.edu or (512) 245-2557.    Professional Development Requirements for Teaching Online   AA/PPS No. 02.03.20  Maintenance and Improvement of Quality in Teaching requires anyone who will teach an online (INT) or hybrid (HYB) course to participate in an approved professional development program.  Soon, anyone scheduled to teach a course in summer I or scheduled to teach an INT or HYB course in any summer term and who has not previously been approved for online teaching will receive a message from the Office of Distance and Extended Learning (ODEL) about how to access the program.  Other participants are welcome, including those who completed the program in the past.  Questions may be directed to ODEL at (512) 245-2322 or via email at distanceedu@txstate.edu.   Faculty only engaged in dissertation, thesis, independent study, and individualized instruction in summer I will not be required to participate in the professional development program.  For all other courses coded as INT or HYB, professional development will be necessary for faculty who have not previously completed the program.  Some faculty scheduled to teach during Summer I may not yet have a netID.  These faculty are still required to meet the requirement and will need guest accounts in Canvas until their net IDs arrive.  Their names, along with a request to add them to Canvas as a guest user, may be sent to distanceed@txstate.edu.  Resources for Moving Forward   Now that the intensive rush toward remote instruction has dissipated, there are unknowns and new realities facing each one of us.  My office compiled a few resources that may be helpful to you, colleagues, and family members as we move into the last few weeks of the spring semester.  20 Tips for Working from Home: https://www.pcmag.com/news/get-organized-20-tips-for-working-from-home Building Resilience in the Era of COVID-19: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hope-resilience/202003/building-resilience-in-the-era-covid-19 How Early Career Scientists are Coping with COVID-19: https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2020/04/how-early-career-scientists-are-coping-covid-19-challenges-and-fears That Discomfort Youre Feeling is Grief:  https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief Technology Tips  The quickest route to service through ITAC is to engage the LiveChat function on this page: https://livechat.itac.txstate.edu/  If students are having difficulty with internet speed, remind them that plugging directly into a wireless router with an ethernet cable will yield faster results.  It also works for faculty and staff! Do you have innovative ideas (or frustrations) to share on using technology for teaching and learning?  All are welcome to join Lets Do Lunch each Friday at 12:00 p.m.: https://www.facdv.txstate.edu/Special-Events/Lunch.html Academic integrity, including the way that technology may affect testing and assignments, is a lingering question for some faculty.

       " 'Faculty and Staff,   While social distancing, hand-washing and staying home if sick remain the most important strategies for slowing the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  Based on this CDC recommendation, Texas State University is encouraging faculty, staff and students working on campus whose work makes it difficult to maintain social distancing to use cloth facemasks.  Employees can purchase their own cloth facemask through a variety of online retailers or in the TSUS marketplace, or find many easy do-it-yourself mask-making guides online such as those provided by the CDC at Cloth Face Coverings.  Surgical masks or respirators should be reserved for medical professionals, public safety officials and laboratory environments.   The university has secured approximately 2,000 cloth facemasks for employees who cannot obtain one from other sources, and will provide up to two cloth facemasks upon request.  Facemasks may be picked up at the University Distribution Center located at 305 River Ridge Parkway in San Marcos, Texas or can be delivered by requesting them using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form.  When using the Requesting Catalog Delivery Form, select Other for Item Needed and enter Facemask in the next field to identify the item needed.  In the Number of Cartons Needed field, enter the names and employee ID numbers of up to 5 employees in the same office.  For those wanting to pick up facemasks, please call the University Distribution Center at 512-245-2294 to get a time for pick up between 8am -12 pm or 1pm - 5pm.    Asymptomatic persons infected with COVID-19 can unknowingly spread infection.  Facemasks can help reduce the risk of spreading infection to others.  It is important to review these Facemask Use and Care guidelines to learn how to properly use, store and clean re-usable cloth facemasks.  Improper use of a face mask reduces its safety benefits and increases the risk of exposure.  If deemed appropriate, department supervisors may want to review this information with their employees.

       " ' Texas State University announces the Bobcat Cares program to provide funds directly to currently enrolled and eligible students with COVID-19 related expenses, emergency grants to all students enrolled in summer courses, pro-rated refunds of certain spring semester charges, and a new scholarship to cover fee and tuition costs for the fall 2020 semester.     The $30 million in student assistance includes over $15 million in federal emergency funding from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the CARES Act. The CARES allocation will help Texas State students deal with the financial burden caused by the COVID-19 crisis and assist with the costs of attending college by providing money directly to them.  For many of our students, the financial insecurity brought on by COVID-19 is an overwhelming burden, said Texas State University President Denise Trauth. I want to thank the members of our Texas Congressional delegation for their support of the CARES Act and the help it is providing our students. Our goal is to get this money to them as quickly as possible to help meet their immediate needs so they can focus on continuing their education at Texas State.   Currently enrolled full-time and part-time students can apply to the university for funding to offset expenses incurred related to housing, food, and technology and course materials. Beginning April 27, students can complete a brief online application showing their need for the funds. The emergency grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, and the funding is not tied to existing financial aid programs such as the Pell grant. The money will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.   In addition to the CARES Act funds, Texas State has identified $5 million to provide all students enrolled in funded courses during Summer I and/or Summer II classes a one-time emergency grant equal to $50 per credit hour up to $600 across both summer sessions. The grant funding will be in the form of a credit to student accounts to reduce the cost of summer courses.   For students currently enrolled in the spring semester, the university is issuing more than $10 million in pro-rated refunds and credits for on-campus housing for those who moved from university residence halls to slow the spread of the coronavirus, parking fees, and dining. In addition, students employed through the Federal and State Work Study programs who have been unable to work onsite or remotely due to the COVID-19 situation will receive emergency grants.   To support students enrolling in the fall 2020 semester, the university created the new Bobcats to Bobcats scholarship fund with a goal of providing $1 million to help students pay for tuition and fees as they continue their education.  I want our students and their families to know their safety is our top priority, and we are just as committed to helping them gain financial security in these very uncertain times. Texas State will do everything in our power to support our students during this difficult time so that they can continue to pursue the education and careers they desire, Trauth said.',\n",
       " 'As we close the fourth week of remote instruction, I want to highlight the positive innovations that continue to result from Texas State Universitys strategic and values-based response to COVID-19.

This means final exams must be delivered in a remote format and may not be conducted on campus. For spring 2020, final exams begin on Wednesday, May 6, 2020.  The final exam schedule remains intact and students  should be able to take class finals within the same day and time window originally published in the schedule: https://www.registrar.txstate.edu/persistent-links/final-exam-schedule.html  Faculty questions about the final exams may be directed to department chairs and school directors.

For this reason, all faculty are encouraged to consider the self-paced training program described here:https://www.distancelearning.txstate.edu/faculty/online-teaching-certification.html  Remote Classroom Behavior   On Thursday, April 16, 2020, all students received a message from the Dr. Joanne Smith, vice president for Student Affairs.  The message conveyed the importance of appropriate behavior in the remote classroom and reminded students about the universitys Code of Student Conduct  and Honor Code.  Faculty questions about student conduct may directed to the Dean of Students at (512) 245-2124 or via email at DOS@txstate.edu.  Questions about the honor code may be addressed to Dr. Cristian Lieneck, chair of the Honor Code  Council, via email at cl31@txstate.edu.

       " ' Although some shelter-in-place orders are expiring or being amended at the state, county and local levels, all safety measures Texas State University implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in place through the Summer 1 session (July 2, 2020).    Texas State will continue to provide online instruction for students and enhanced remote work options for employees until July 2. Faculty, staff and students should practice social distancing when interacting with others on our campuses and wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible.    Thank you for your continued commitment to our students and your work to keep Texas State operating during the past several weeks.  More information will follow in the coming weeks regarding plans for the remainder of the summer.  For support and services during this time, visit Texas State COVID-19 Helpful Resources.

       " ' In preparation to resume in-person teaching for classes held during the second summer session beginning July 6 and the fall 2020 semester, Texas State University has established several pandemic and post-pandemic work groups to address areas related to safety, learning and university operations.   During the current spring semester in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Texas State transitioned more than 5,200 courses to remote delivery on March 30, and approximately 5,000 students moved from the San Marcos Campus. The university has remained open with essential staffing through the spring semester, supporting students virtually and on campuses. More than 80 percent of faculty and staff are working remotely to sustain university operations.  Summer I classes (June 1-July 1) will continue to be delivered remotely with plans for students returning to the university on July 6 for the summer II session.   As we anticipate returning to face-to-face instruction for summer II classes and the fall semester, we are working to adapt university operations to ensure we have a safe, healthy learning and working environment for our students, faculty and staff, said Texas State President Denise Trauth. When we return to in-person instruction, we are preparing to operate in a very different environment. I have established five work groups to create a university-wide plan that will drive the actions we will take to mitigate risks, deliver quality education, and protect our university community.   In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, uncertainty abounds. Texas State University is committed to entering the unchartered waters wisely. Together, we have the knowledge, creativity, and ingenuity to face challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis and come out of this situation stronger and better than ever,  Trauth said.  Recommendations from the work groups will be reviewed by the Presidents Cabinet by June 15 with a university plan ready for implementation July 1.',\n",
       " ' As we close the fifth week of remote instruction, I am reminded of how much has changed at Texas State University since mid-March 2020. Throughout it all, I have been inspired by the numerous displays of cooperation, transparency, and innovation as we swiftly adapted to the challenges of COVID-19.  Among other initiatives, the university continues to implement plans that bolster student success, enhance the teaching and learning environment, and prepare all of us for a resilient and safe future.  Bobcat Cares  As reported last week, the university launched the Bobcat Cares program to help ease the financial strain many Texas State University students are experiencing. Applications to the program began April 27, 2020. The initial awardees include nearly 4,700 students, who will receive a total of $4.5 million in direct support in the coming days. Please join me in thanking staff in Financial Aid and Scholarships, Student Business Services, Information Technology, and other areas for making these funds rapidly available for deserving students.  Bobcat Promise  Texas State has expanded the tuition-free Bobcat Promise program to give more Texas students the chance to attend the university despite the growing financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bobcat Promise is designed to increase access for Texas students with a family adjusted gross income (AGI) that does not exceed $50,000 annually. Previously, the upper AGI limit was set at $35,000. Read more about this initiative here: https://news.txstate.edu/inside-txst/2020/texas-state-expands-bobcat-promise-in-response-to-covid19-pandemic  Camp Canvas  Earlier this week, faculty received notice about Camp Canvas taking place May 19, 2020 through May 22, 2020. The IT Assistance Center and the Office of Distance and Extended Learning have partnered to bring faculty an excellent learning experience focused on Canvas, the universitys new learning management system to replace TRACS. Faculty are encouraged to attend the camps online sessions, ranging from Canvas basics to in-depth sessions on multimedia, student engagement, and other topics. The Canvas Essentials workshop is recommended for all faculty who are new to Canvas. More information, including how to sign up for workshops, may be found here: https://itac.txstate.edu/support/training/canvas-camp  EP Grades  The university has implemented a one-time process for spring 2020 that allows students to request that a final passing grade be changed to Emergency Pass, or EP, upon approval of the instructor of record. Students are responsible for submitting written modification requests to faculty by Monday, May 25, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. and for assessing the impact of EP grades on their GPAs, program requirements, financial aid eligibility, and other academic factors. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday, May 29, 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/.   While the FAQ webpage on EP grades (https://www.txstate.edu/coronavirus/frequently-asked-questions/current-students/emergency-pass-grading.html) is focused on current students, it does answer faculty questions. Faculty are encouraged to check with their chair or director for more specific guidance regarding EP grades.  Final Exam Period   The transition to remote instruction for spring 2020 includes the final exam period.  This means final exams must be delivered in a remote format and may not be conducted on campus. For spring 2020, final exams begin on Wednesday, May 6, 2020.

       " ' The Texas State University Systems seven member institutions have begun plans to resume face-to-face instruction this fall, while implementing enhanced health and safety measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Institution leaders are working to develop campus-specific operational plans based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and other public health agencies.   Presidents at each TSUS institution will have flexibility to establish health and safety protocols based on local needs, said Chancellor Brian McCall. We have an obligation to accommodate students who want to continue their studies on campus this fall, but also a responsibility to keep our communities as safe as possible while the state and federal governments continue their work to manage the spread of COVID-19.   Health and safety protocols may include social distancing efforts, the use of face coverings, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and health screening procedures. While institutions plan to resume face-to-face instruction this fall, these plans are subject to change if conditions worsen in Texas in the coming months.   The Texas State University System, established in 1911, consists of seven institutions serving more than 86,000 students from the Big Bend Region of West Texas to the Louisiana border. TSUS member institutions include Lamar University, Sam Houston State University, Sul Ross State University, Texas State University, Lamar Institute of Technology, Lamar State College Orange, and Lamar State College Port Arthur.

Trauth announced that the university has established the TXST Monarch Center for Immigrant Students to provide resources, support, and information to our university community. The Monarch Center will encompass the work of many offices across the university and serve as a catalyst for accomplishing key recommendations made by the DACA Task Force, which has transitioned into the centers Advisory and Resource Network. The Monarch Center, located in existing space on the San Marcos Campus, will be accessible when Texas State returns to in-person instruction. In the meantime, students, faculty, or staff who would like to reach the Monarch Center, should contact Ms. Michelle Sotolongo, the TXST Monarch Center Coordinator at (512) 245-6001 or via email.  Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Work Groups   Several pandemic and post-pandemic work groups have been developed to address areas related to health, wellness and safety, continuity of education, faculty and staff morale, and other university priorities. President Trauth announced these work groups last week. The groups recommendations are due in the coming weeks, so if you have questions or ideas to share, please email them to the chair of the appropriate work group.

       " 'Dear Bobcats,   When the decision was made to move classes to remote delivery after spring break to protect our Texas State University community from the spread of the coronavirus, we also decided to postpone spring commencement to August 6 and 8, 2020, to coincide with August 7, 2020, summer ceremonies.   The commencement feasibility work group, which included student representatives, faculty senators, a dean representative, the registrar, the commencement coordinator, the associate vice president for academic affairs, and the chief medical officer, has searched for the safest options to hold commencement events for more than 6,000 graduates and their families and friends over three days of ceremonies. After exhausting every possible scenario, we have made the hard decision that it will not be possible to hold in-person commencement ceremonies in August 2020 for spring and summer graduates while adhering to the required social distancing measures. Instead, we will share virtual commencement ceremonies on August 6, 7, and 8, 2020.   As President, Commencement is my favorite time of year. Like many of you, I am disappointed that we cannot come together in person to celebrate this special occasion. However, I take comfort in knowing that we are doing the right thing to protect our Bobcat family and the greater San Marcos community.   I know this may feel like a diminished experience, but by no means does it lessen the accomplishments of our graduates. Commencement is important because it is the ceremony to celebrate and formally recognize the degrees you have earned as graduates of Texas State University.  No matter what form commencement takes, those degrees are yours now, and for the rest of your lives.   Planning is underway to ensure we have a very special experience to honor our graduates during a virtual commencement. We want to honor our brave students who persevered and graduated despite the disruption caused by the pandemic.   To our graduates, I offer you a sincere and heartfelt congratulations. Your dedication and tenacity have shown the world what it means to be a Bobcat.  Sincerely,  Denise M. Trauth President',\n",
       " \" Dear Texas State University Community,   In my May 1, 2020 email to the Texas State University community about our preparation to resume in-person teaching for summer II classes and the fall semester, I outlined several work groups established to create a plan that protects the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff as they return to live, learn, and work on our campuses.   These work groups are comprised of more than 120 faculty, staff, and students representing a broad range of departments, expertise, professions, and voices. It is this diversity in thought and experience that will ensure our return to in-person instruction will address the safety and educational needs of our community.    I originally established five work groups, but that number has grown to eight to make our effort even more comprehensive.

University leaders are following developments regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19, and will keep our campus community informed. Any students, faculty and staff traveling to Italy or any other country considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be a level 3 risk for coronavirus are required to follow the guidelines to self-quarantine for two weeks, and not return to campus unless they are asymptomatic for that period. The level 3 warning urges people to avoid nonessential travel if the destination is an affected area. China and South Korea already were categorized as being at level 3, which put them on Texas A&M’s suspend-all-travel list. Aggieland low risk Please keep in mind that while COVID-19 is an epidemic in some parts of the world, the Department of State Health Services says that Texas is considered to be at low risk. Closer to home, the Brazos County Health Department considers Aggieland to be at low risk as well. At this time, the CDC and World Health Organization are not recommending canceling or postponing other worldwide travel. Therefore, the university is not canceling any other Education Abroad programs already underway or for those planning other trips over Spring Break. In the coming weeks, Texas A&M will arrange to refund trip costs for the approximately 30 students and faculty who planned to study abroad in Italy over Spring Break. Those impacted by this decision who need to make alternate housing arrangements over Spring Break, along with students who have questions related to the Education Abroad program, can email ea-covid19@tamu.edu. A&M planning well underway Texas A&M University is more than a month into planning for responding to whatever might come our way. A team of university officials continues to constantly monitor the outbreak of the fast-spreading respiratory illness worldwide. To assess potential risks related to the illness, the university is working with governmental agencies, professional health and security organizations, our academic partners and others. Texas A&M strongly recommends that everyone reconsider even personal travel to any country with a level 3 advisory based on the novel coronavirus. For countries at level 2 and 3, travelers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to campus. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites. Students who are traveling should, in addition to taking recommended measures to prevent getting sick, take basic precautions to prepare for potential travel disruptions. We will need your help. A few easy things we can all do include: Wash your hands for 20 seconds Use hand sanitizer Avoid shaking hands  Disinfect frequently touched objects using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe stay home when you are sick and avoid close contact with those who are sick Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Texas A&M will continue to work with federal, state and local officials to monitor potential risks. If conditions change, we will update our campus community.

To that end, today’s update relates to our students, faculty, staff and visitors who have visited areas affected by COVID-19, or the coronavirus. To date, no such cases have been reported in Brazos County, which is home to Aggieland.

Spring Break and personal travel: Texas A&M does not set requirements for personal travel, but we are strongly urging people to not travel to areas with active community transmission and/or Level 1, 2 or 3 countries. All travelers are encouraged to check the CDC’s COVID-19 travel page, State Department travel advisories, and the International Air Transport Association’s list of travel and entry restrictions for the latest information before departing. Regardless of personal or professional travel, all individuals visiting Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to undergo the 14-day self-isolation period before returning to campus. Note that if you leave the country, your trip may affect your ability to return to the United States and campus. During the 14 days of self-isolation, students should contact Student Health Services for updated guidance and requirements prior to returning to school or work. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation and it is difficult to anticipate what the future may hold. We encourage you to monitor developments through the State Department and CDC websites.

We highly recommend following CDC guidelines to self-isolate during this period. Should symptoms occur, seek immediate medical attention. Guidance for International Travel Texas A&M University-sponsored student education abroad spring programs for CDC-labeled Level 1, 2 and 3 COVID-19 countries have been cancelled. Other programs are scheduled to continue and will follow the same protocol should those countries move into any of these categories. For other countries, programs will be discontinued if the threat level increases. For faculty and staff, mission-critical travel to countries Level 1 or above will require high-level institutional approval prior to departure. What Does it Mean to Self-Isolate? If you are not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 and are asked to self-isolate after returning from a country listed on the CDC’s COVID-19 travel advisories page as Level 2 or Level 3, you should stay home — in your room, your apartment, or your house. Do not go to campus including work, classes, athletic events or other social gatherings until 14 days after leaving the Level 2 or 3 country in question. Likewise, avoid public places and gatherings in the community. Please follow these guidelines for self-isolation: Report any symptoms of COVID-19 immediately to your medical provider – preferably by calling to get advice and instructions. Texas A&M students and international visiting scholars may call (979) 458-8300. For after-hours contact/inquiries, call the Dial-a-Nurse program at (979) 458-8379. Stay in your room or apartment. Do not go to work, classes, athletic events, or other social or religious gatherings until 14 days after your return to the United States from the country in question. Limit contact as much as possible. This also means limiting close contact with others including persons living in your residence. Wash your hands with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs after coughing or sneezing or throwing a used tissue in the garbage. Avoid sharing household items. Do not share drinking glasses, towels, eating utensils, bedding, or any other items until you are no longer asked to self-isolate. Keep your surroundings clean. While the virus is not spread very well from contact with soiled household surfaces, try to clean surfaces that you share with others, such as door knobs, telephones, and bathroom surfaces (or any other object that you sneeze or cough on), with a standard household disinfectant wipe. Wash your hands after cleaning the area. Monitor yourself for symptoms at least daily including measuring your temperature. Any symptoms of COVID-19 should be reported to your physician. Cover coughs and sneezes with your upper sleeve or a tissue. Never cough in the direction of someone else. How to Protect Myself Stay educated on the disease by reading the CDC website. Most people who become infected experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of yourself by following recommendations from the CDC: Stay home if you don’t feel well. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance before arriving at a medical facility. Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water for 20 seconds. This helps kill viruses that might be on your hand. Stay at least three feet away from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow good respiratory hygiene, which means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the tissue immediately.

The registration is required for both personal and university business travel before leaving or immediately upon return. In addition to logging online to register travel, individuals who traveled from or through a Level 2 or 3 country are required to self-isolate off-campus upon returning from those countries for 14 days before returning to campus. This is especially important as some on our campus are traveling over Spring Break. Please pass this new requirement along to friends and colleagues just in case they haven't yet heard. Self-isolation requires that you do not come to campus including work, residence halls, on-campus apartments, classes, athletic events or other social gatherings until 14 days without symptoms after leaving the Level 2 or 3 country in question. The 14-day clock starts on the day a person leaves one of those countries. Likewise, please avoid public places and gatherings in the community. For more information and guidance about how to self-isolate visit the coronavirus FAQ page. The University is working to accommodate the classes and work schedules for students and personnel who self-isolate or are ill. More information about these accommodations will be posted over the next week. Report any symptoms of COVID-19 immediately to your medical - provider preferably by calling to get advice and instructions. Texas A&M students and international visiting scholars may call (979) 458-8300. For after-hours contact/inquiries, call the Dial-a-Nurse program at (979) 458-8379.

Student workers are permitted to work in person on campus provided that the department for which they work implements appropriate social distancing requirements and other safety measures. We recommend that departments be creative in identifying mechanisms to allow student workers to work remotely with the provision that appropriate duties can be assigned and that the department has mechanisms in place to monitor that work. Student workers should contact their supervisor regarding their ability to work. Students feeling ill should not come to work and should self-monitor and seek medical care if needed. Students not ill and not wishing to work in person will not be required to do so and will continue to be paid only if remote work is a possibility per above and approved by their supervisor. If students are unable to work in person or remotely, the student will not be paid. Departments are encouraged to provide as much flexibility regarding duties as feasible. Sincerely, Carol A.

As a result of the increased health screening upon arrival at these airports, and as these airports are experiencing long delays and large volumes of traffic clearing customs and health screening, any international traveler arriving at these airports (listed below) – be it coming from a Level 3 or other country – from Saturday March 14 onward will have an increased chance of exposure than other travelers. Therefore, any faculty, staff and students returning from international travel on or after March 14 and arriving in-country to clear customs at the Boston (BOS), Miami (MIA), New York City (JFK), Chicago (ORD), San Francisco (SFO), Seattle (SEA), Los Angeles (LAX), Atlanta (ATL), Honolulu (HNL), Newark (EWR), Dallas (DFW), Detroit (DTW) or Washington, D.C. (IAD) international airports should consider themselves as having returned from a Level 3 COVID-19 location and self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival before returning to campus. Self-isolation guidance is listed in Frequently Asked Questions section of this web page and on the CDC Care Guide.

The university is planning mail delivery of diplomas to graduates (with normal shipping costs waived) and is also considering opportunities for in-person ceremony options later this summer for those May graduates wishing to do so. There is no impact at this time to August in-person graduation ceremonies. Three other major decisions made today include the following: Final exams will not be taken in person. Online testing and other mechanisms for the assessment of student learning are under consideration in collaboration with college deans and faculty and will be announced in the near future. Family Weekend, a 101-year-old tradition filled with dozens of events scheduled for April has also been canceled. The Campus Muster Committee announced that the campus Muster Ceremony would not be held in its traditional in-person format in Reed Arena. The Muster Committee is working closely with The Association of Former Students to provide guidance to the campus and the entire Aggie Network. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic last week, prompting Brazos County, the State of Texas and the federal government to declare a public health emergency. Meanwhile, the White House advised Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The Association of Former Students announced earlier today that Aggie Ring Day scheduled for April has been canceled. Alternate plans were sent to recipients through an email notification. Students will be able to have their ring mailed to them or they can pick it up at the Williams Alumni Center after Texas A&M resumes normal operations. President Michael K. Young said that leaders at the university recognize how the cancellations and changes associated with the virus have created uncertainty and disappointment. \"These are very difficult decisions made with careful thought and input from faculty, staff and students,\" Young said. \"Around the world and here in Aggieland, the unprecedented disruption and sprawling impact of the pandemic are unfolding at a precious time for our university — graduation, finals, major events. And at the same time, we know that most essential is preserving health and safety and continuing to support ongoing education online.\" \"Aggies always rise to the occasion and I’m confident we will do so in this situation,\" he said. \"We need to take care of each other, support one another and together we will find our way through.\" Frequently Asked Questions and other updated information can be viewed on the TAMU COVID-19 Guidance site.',\n",
       " 'March 19, 2020, 4:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and Aggie Network, Our nation, state and we here at Texas A&M University face serious challenges from this global pandemic. This extraordinary situation with COVID-19 coronavirus requires applying everything we are as Aggies – leadership, loyalty, integrity, excellence, respect for each other, and, of course, selfless service – to navigate daily challenges. During this moment of uncertainty, I understand the stress and anxiety many may feel. And yet, I have great faith in our Aggie community. We will get through this together and demonstrate again Aggies’ capacity to surmount every challenge. Just today, Brazos County Health District reported that one of our students in Brazos County tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling to New York. We have confirmed that the student was not on campus after travelling to New York. We send our best wishes for recovery and are supporting our student and the health authorities. There are no other known cases among Texas A&M students, faculty and staff at this time. We continue to monitor developments and will keep you apprised. Like many of you, in addition to concern for all who may face such a diagnosis, I am deeply disappointed that circumstances have forced us to postpone or adjust so many of our timeless traditions. I think of the thousands of students whose hearts were set on walking across the stage to receive their diplomas in May. I think of those who were looking forward to honoring a loved one in person here at Muster. Of dozens of events related to the 101-year-old Family Weekend tradition. And I think of those who dreamed of proudly receiving their Aggie ring, surrounded by family and friends at the Haynes Ring Plaza. In recent days, I am reminded that these are not the only traditions that define us. So too does the character that the absence of these beloved events reveals inside us. As we continue to monitor the best ways to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic pandemic, I am sincerely grateful for everyone helping us address our two highest priorities. First of all, I would like to thank all of those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff at our campuses in Texas, at our Qatar campus, and in support of our education abroad programs around the world. Our spirit of collaboration and compassion has been on full display as we continue to work diligently to assist students who have been impacted by our current state of affairs. Secondly, I want to recognize the large contingent of faculty and staff who are helping us keep our core educational mission intact as much as possible by making the transition to online classes, further protecting the wellbeing of our campuses and local communities. I would like to offer a few words about our operations as we are set to resume all classes next week online. We’ve seen a lot of campus closures across the nation. We remain open as circumstances allow with a full commitment to protecting the safety and educational environment for students who choose to come back to our campuses, as well as faculty and staff. On our campuses, this translates to remote work where possible for faculty and staff while core on-campus services continue. The “new normal” for the time being includes a number of adjustments: online instruction, as well as online support, including counseling and advising, take-away-only dining and limited transportation with social distancing throughout all campus facilities. While many of our students have returned or have chosen to stay at their homes elsewhere, those on our campuses will experience modified services to ensure safety and a productive learning environment. We encourage students and their families to determine the best choice themselves, be it in their homes or on one of our Texas campuses. Our collective efforts have helped us respond to COVID-19 challenges as they arise, and we are also mindful that new developments and recommendations are constantly emerging, which is why we’ve created a central website for coronavirus updates  across a range of relevant topics. As you all know, circumstances change on a rapid basis. I encourage you to visit the site often for the latest updates. Although what we are undergoing now is certainly not part of the common Texas A&M educational experience, it’s not entirely unprecedented. More than 100 years ago, in response to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, university activities were dramatically modified. Aggies learned then the lessons about dedication, resilience and service. And again today, this situation teaches us lessons of perseverance, innovation, compassion and loyalty to our communities, our state, our nation and our world. With gratitude for all you’re doing and great appreciation for the privilege I have of being part of the Aggie community, I thank you for your patience and understanding as we get through this together.

To all Members of the Texas A&M University Community: The welfare and safety of our community during this time is our primary concern. We are writing to inform you of recent developments relating to COVID-19. Over the past two weeks, President Young and Provost Fierke and other university leaders have communicated warnings and developments daily via mass emails, social media alerts, and a university COVID-19 central website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. We continue to work in concert with the guidance and response efforts of the federal government, the state of Texas and local authorities. This one-time communication provides the required warning related to these events. Ongoing updates regarding Texas A&M actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will be posted on https://www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/. For Galveston campus, visit  https://www.tamug.edu/covid-19/. For TAMU-Qatar, visit https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/coronavirus. Yesterday, President Young issued a letter to campus in which he identified the first known case of a student living off-campus who tested positive for COVID-19. Today, the Brazos County Health District announced a total of six confirmed cases to-date of COVID-19 in Brazos County including a second case involving another off-campus Texas A&M student who followed appropriate protocols in seeking treatment at the on-campus Student Health Services (SHS). The SHS has separate staffed entrances and instructions on its page at https://shs.tamu.edu/coronavirus/ for reporting-for-treatment protocols related to COVID-19 symptoms. The individual was tested at SHS and directed to self-isolate at his off-campus residence. The Brazos County Health District has tracked contact patterns to be in communication with those with whom these individuals came in close contact. The Brazos County Health District advised today evidence of community spread in Brazos County, as has been the case in other areas of Texas. This community spread case was not one of the aforementioned Texas A&M cases. Since that time, we have learned of two more individuals associated with Texas A&M who have tested positive: one individual who works in a small area of the veterinary school and one individual at the Round Rock campus of the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Health authorities have been notified and contact tracing begun. We take this opportunity to remind our community of important information regarding COVID-19. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, we are requesting your immediate attention to and compliance with the following health-authority-recommended practices – not only to ensure your own well-being, but the well-being of others: Engage in social distancing of six or more feet. Stay home when ill or if other family members are ill. Leverage telework options. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Get a flu vaccine. Watch for cough, troubled breathing, or other signs of respiratory infection. Monitor temperature for a fever above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C). As stated above, ongoing updates regarding Texas A&M’s response to COVID-19 will be posted on https://www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/. For Galveston campus, visit  https://www.tamug.edu/covid-19/.

       " 'March 21, 2020, 1:20 p.m. CDT Temporary Changes to Grading, Q-Drop and Withdrawal Deadlines Sent on behalf of President Michael K. Young and Provost and Executive Vice President Carol A. Fierke Upon a recommendation from the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and approved by President Young, students will have the opportunity to choose Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for any course in which they are enrolled in the spring semester 2020. Students have until 5pm on Tuesday, April 28th to make changes to their grading options. Details of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee’s proposal are outlined below. Additional guidance to students on how to opt-in to S/U grading will be provided next week. This may not be applicable to students in first professional degree programs who should contact their program for grading information. In addition to the S/U grading, the Q-drop and Withdrawal deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. on Friday, April 24th. Q-drops after Spring Break will not count toward the institutional limit of 4 nor the state limit on drops. Any student considering the change from graded to S/U grading may need to consult with an academic advisor, professional school advisor, athletics advisor, or financial aid advisor to understand the implications of the change on one’s future plans including progress toward a degree or financial aid. Finally, the Faculty Senate Executive Committee is asking faculty to ensure that students have ample opportunity to engage with them during this shift to online instruction. We would like to thank the Faculty Senate Executive Committee for their work and deliberation on these important matters. FULL TEXT OF FACULTY SENATE RECOMMENDATIONS The Faculty Senate Executive Committee met on March 18, 2020 to discuss options surrounding issues of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading this semester. The recommendations of the Faculty Senate on this issue are: Retain the course’s current grading scheme as the default (e.g., Letter grade: A, B, C, D, or F). Students may choose an S/U grading scheme on a course-by-course basis for the spring 2020 semester. All programs that normally require a course for a letter grade must accept S/U grades for all courses this semester. Students will be allowed to switch to S/U Grading until the last day of classes by 5 p.m. on April 28th. Students are strongly advised to talk with their academic advisor before switching any course to S/U grading. If a student is currently not making satisfactory academic progress for financial aid and is on an academic plan, those students should consult with a financial aid advisor prior to switching any course to S/U grading. The S/U grading will adhere to its current Definition in Student Rule 10 (Student Rule 10; “S: Satisfactory (C or above, hours not included in GPA, U: Unsatisfactory (D or F), no grade points, hours included in GPA), except as noted in number 7 below. Any U or F grade received this semester will be removed from GPA computations. S/U grading applies to both Undergraduates and Graduate Students. Similarly, the Executive Committee also recommends the University consider: Extending the Q-drop deadline until April 24th. Q-drops requested after Spring Break will not be added to the student’s cumulative Q-Drop total. Extending the withdrawal deadline to 5 p.m. on April 24th. The Faculty Senate Executive Committee also makes the following recommendation regarding Instructional office hours this semester: The Faculty Senate Executive Committee believes it is the responsibility of all Faculty and Instructors of Record to ensure that all students have adequate access to their instructors during this unique semester. Therefore, we implore every Instructor of Record to ensure that they are holding frequent, potentially extended, and published office hours. This published information, disseminated to their students, should include specific details on the instructor’s preferred method of communication, and how, where, and when that instructor can be contacted.',\n",
       " 'March 23, 2020, 10:30 a.m. CDT Dear Faculty and Staff, I would like to express my tremendous gratitude to everyone helping us mobilize the entire university in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19). In a matter of days, your heroic efforts have helped us fundamentally change everything we do – from educating our students, to conducting research, to maintaining essential business operations. During this challenging time, you have shown us the true character of our university community. Aggies never shrink from a challenge, they always rise to the occasion – with decisive action, inspiring innovation and remarkable determination. As faculty members, you have demonstrated your incredible care for and commitment to our students. Although circumstances have dramatically altered your plans for research and teaching, you have stepped up at an important moment. You have shared your collective wisdom and resources with colleagues across the university, working rapidly and tirelessly to rewrite syllabi and take all of our educational efforts online. I know how meaningful your efforts are for our students, and I want you to know how much all of us appreciate your hard work. I also want to thank and recognize the dedication of our exceptional staff across the university. At a time of great need, you have stepped forward with flexibility, resiliency and resolve. In addition to keeping our campus clean and safe, you are providing the entire IT infrastructure that is making all of our endeavors possible – from online classes, to Zoom meetings, to keeping our Learning Management System running smoothly. In only days you have set up both the TAMU Keep Teaching site to help faculty get connected quickly with resources as well as the TAMU Keep Learning site to help students do the same. You have also conducted most of the 1,342 technology trainings centrally, as well as countless sessions in our colleges and departments. The Central TAMU COVID-19 site that provides a centralized hub for updates and resources has been viewed more than 325,000 times. As we move so many services online, we know the process won’t be perfect. There will be challenges that will arise and things that may not work as planned. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we do our best to maintain the very highest quality of education and research, as well as ensure the health and safety of everyone at Texas A&M. For many members of our university community, this has been a demanding time. So many of you have worked round-the-clock, night and day, without rest or relief. You have had to adjust work schedules and find new solutions for childcare. While words may be of little comfort, I want you to know this. We all see your efforts. We appreciate all of your contributions. And we are all truly grateful for your extraordinary service. Thank you for your support and your continued commitment as we work together to keep everyone safe and carry out our educational mission. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'Update: March 23, 2020, 6 p.m. CDT At 4:30 p.m. March 23, Brazos County Judge Duane Peters, along with the mayors of Bryan and College Station, ordered individuals to shelter at their place of residence beginning at 9 p.m. Tuesday, March 24 for two weeks. This does not preclude students from leaving campus to travel home or to travel to essential activities (obtaining food, healthcare and medical supplies) or exercising outside with social distancing of six feet or more. For the full order, go here. March 23, 2020, 3:00 p.m. CDT Students, Yesterday, Governor Abbott held a news conference to brief on measures that he and other state leaders are taking to help slow the spread of COVID-19, including not leaving home unless necessary. He did not order a state-wide shelter in place of residence to allow counties the option to do so on a county-by-county basis. Given that Dallas and McLennan Counties have announced their own shelter in place of residence orders, and others may follow suit very soon, all students may want to consider returning to their family home residences. For those in need of housing, you may remain in on-campus housing and should be prepared to shelter in place if the order follows for our College Station and/or Galveston campuses. We will of course continue dining take-out, medical and other essential services, and academic affairs support has already moved online. On-campus students choosing to depart may utilize an “Express Check-Out” option with Residence Life to allow for an orderly move of belongings. Students who have been dwelling in their family homes but retained on-campus housing and wish to check out may also coordinate with Residence Life on arranging to pick up their belongings at some point this semester. The Texas A&M System is reviewing dining and housing credit or refund options and will provide guidance in the very near future. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we do all we can to support Aggies, especially those who may not have other housing and dining options. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'March 24, 2020, 12:00 p.m. CDT Campus Credits/Refund Message Texas A&M University is pleased to provide the following options to students for prorated credits for housing and dining as follows. Refunds for parking have been included in FAQs on the TAMU COVID-19 website and will be handled under normal procedures, found at: https://transport.tamu.edu/parking.aspx. For those considering departure from on-campus housing this spring given the pandemic, you may do so anytime between now and the end of the semester, May 9, by coordinating with Residence Life, to include social distancing as required when arranging for check-out. Housing (Residence Halls, Corps of Cadets, and White Creek): For residents canceling their housing contract, removing their belongings, and returning their key prior to March 24, 2020, room rent refunds or credits will be based on the number of nights between March 24 and the end of the contract term, May 9.  For residents canceling their housing contract, removing their belongings, and returning their key after March 24, room rent refunds or credits will be based on the number of nights between the date of check-out and the end of the contract term, May 9. Individuals who have questions about this process should contact Residence Life: 888-451-3896 or 979-845-4744 or https://reslife.tamu.edu/on-campus-housing-update/ Housing (Gardens Apartments): For residents canceling their 2019-2020 Gardens contract, beginning March 24, rent and electric charges will end on the day the key is returned to the office or key drop box at the north entrance of the community center. There will be no penalties for failure to give full notice and early cancellation from March 24 through May 22 (or July 31 if a 12-month contract). Dining: Students who wish to receive a refund (or credit) for dining must apply at https://fda.tamu.edu/diningcredit; the students’ dining privileges will be suspended the business day following their application. This refund (or credit) will be calculated based upon the total amount of unused dining dollars and a prorated amount for meal plans based on the length of time between the business day following their application and May 9, 2020. For either Housing (other than Gardens Apartments) or Dining, students may choose to either apply any prorated amounts as a credit to their Fall 2020 student fees or receive a direct refund. The amount of any refund will first be used to reduce any existing balance in the student’s fee account, with any remainder refunded via direct deposit. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'Impact of Shelter in Place of Residence March 24, 2020, 2:00 p.m. CDT Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: These rapid succession of updates are necessary today as we respond to the Brazos County deadline shelter in place of residence order and I ask you to review carefully. Any updates will continue to be housed on the COVID-19 TAMU site. Galveston and other campuses will also issue guidance specific to their locations in line with the information below. Here are some important things you need to know about how the shelter in place of residence order affects the University: Faculty and staff should telework unless deemed essential to be on campus. All non-essential university offices will limit face-to-face interactions and move to virtual support to the general public at 5 p.m. today. All building entrances will revert to controlled access for faculty, staff, and students. We ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss any required on-campus staffing for your office. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Essential on-campus services will continue in support of students, faculty and staff. Even in a telework environment with few on-campus personnel, it is important that we continue to provide limited, yet essential on-campus services in support of students, faculty, and staff. For students, this includes on-campus housing, food service, and student health service as well as limited transportation to and from campus and restricted areas for computing labs and accessing wireless internet. All of these activities must be carried out using social distancing practices. Please see keeplearning.tamu.edu site and the main COVID-19 TAMU site for updates on available student services and hours of operation. Guidance to Faculty and Graduate Students and Continuity of Instruction: For faculty and graduate students who are teaching or supporting instruction, one essential priority is to continue our crucial online course instruction and activities needed to support teaching that will remain online at least through the end of the spring semester. We encourage faculty and graduate students who are teaching courses to develop methods that allow for the continuation of instruction that minimizes time on campus. Those individuals who need campus facilities to teach an online course can contact their respective department head for details on access.  Please refer to keepteaching.tamu.edu site for additional teaching resources. Staff Guidance: For staff, we ask that you contact your supervisor to discuss the expectations of your work arrangements. Please refer to earlier e-mails on the Human Resources web site on instructions for continuing work assignments. Ongoing Critical Services: Critical aspects of our business operations are considered essential under the orders and these will continue. These include but are not limited to: health services, food services that are available to-go, emergency responders, public safety, mail services, residence halls, janitorial and maintenance services, technology support, financial services, essential transportation services, airport, construction where approved, utilities and scientific research. Ongoing Research: Regarding ongoing scientific research, the Office of Research provides the following guidance: To the extent possible, Texas A&M researchers are encouraged to engage in activities that can be performed remotely (e.g., writing, data analysis, etc.); essential laboratory operations are permissible, provided they can be performed while meeting the “6-feet” requirement for social distancing. Graduate researchers may come to the research labs to conduct research activities that cannot be performed remotely. Paid undergraduate student workers may continue to carry out important support functions necessary for continuing laboratory operation. Any individual who is in a high-risk category should not be required to come to campus. Please seevpr.tamu.edu/covid-19 for additional information. Students must comply with applicable local government orders. In most cases, the orders allow students to leave their residence only for essential activities, such as going to the grocery store or picking up to-go meals on campus or from restaurants, visiting a healthcare professional and engaging in outdoor activity, such as walking, hiking, running, or riding a bicycle, with proper social distancing.  Students may also leave to go to university-designated locations for accessing computers and internet resources as indicated on keeplearning.tamu.edu. Please consult the central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. Student Health Including Counseling. For student counseling and student health, please refer to information provided by the Division of Student Affairs. Main Campus University Libraries will be closed to walk-in traffic. However, library personnel will continue digitizing resources to support online teaching. Access to all of the libraries’ digital resources and online research support will continue uninterrupted. We will continue to share information and updates by email, social media and on our central COVID-19 TAMU site for facility availability and hours updates. These are clearly difficult circumstances for everyone. We deeply appreciate the level of commitment of our faculty, staff and students in these challenging times. Michael K. Young President',\n",

I was honored to be invited to join yesterday’s Facebook Live Virtual Town Hall Meeting hosted by Student body President Mikey Jaillet and Student body President-elect Eric Mendoza. Other senior university leaders and myself appreciated the engagement and opportunity to address what is on your minds as we were \"social distanced\" across multiple studios at KAMU and another building! As we continue to respond to new updates, I want to assure you that our top priority is your health and safety. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our faculty and staff, we have made major adjustments to bring everything online, greatly reducing the risk you face during this historic pandemic. For those who needed to return to our campuses, we have taken extensive measures to ensure your safety, with some buildings offering monitors to promote social distancing and all of our facilities providing enhanced procedures to promote public health. As new developments emerge, please visit the TAMU Central COVID-19 Website for coronavirus-related updates across a wide range of relevant topics. Campus remains open, but with classes moving online many of you have decided to stay home. To that end, all of our academic and support services are, to the extent possible, available virtually. I encourage you to visit the Keep Learning site for ongoing updates. For those of you who have decided to stay on campus, we will continue to provide essential services such as grab-and-go dining. Bus transportation will be available on campus, with limited passengers to ensure social distancing. Campus ATMs remain in operation. Please consult the central site or the Keep Learning site for building hours, as some academic buildings will remain accessible only for those who have key card access and will close by 5:00 p.m. Yesterday we were delighted to announce credits or refunds for on-campus housing, dining and parking for those who will no longer use these services this spring. While online classes have gone well so far, please understand that everything will not be perfect. During this unprecedented moment in our nation’s history, our faculty and staff have made enormous efforts to continue your education. However, there may still be logistical challenges that arise, and we may need to make changes to enhance your experience. As we get through this together, I want to assure you that Aggies will continue to learn and graduate from Texas A&M, moving on to engage in extraordinary acts of service to our state, our nation and world just as they have for more than 140 years.

       " 'March 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. CDT Howdy Ags, As loyal members of the Texas A&M community, I wanted you to have the latest information about our response to the coronavirus situation, which you can find in great detail at the Central TAMU COVID-19 site. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff – just as your highest priority is the wellbeing of your families and friends. At the same time, we are always dedicated to providing the very best educational opportunities under even the most challenging circumstances. To this end, our faculty and staff have made impressive efforts to quickly bring every one of our classes and all of our support services online, helping us protect every member of our academic community while providing the highest quality education we possibly can. If you’re interested in learning more, we’ve created a superb TAMU Keep Learning website to ensure our students’ continued success. In light of our capacity to support their education wherever they are located, many of our students have chosen to return home. We have a number of students for whom campus is their primary residence, and others who have chosen to remain on campus because that is the best alternative for their families and their education. To accommodate and support the continued success of those students, we are keeping our campuses and dorms open while taking extensive measures to ensure everyone’s safety, providing monitors for some buildings to promote social distancing and enhanced procedures to promote public health at all of our facilities. Our Student Health Services remain open and actively engaged. Those on campus will still have essential services such as grab-and-go dining, ATM access and bus transportation with social distancing. If you have questions about which areas of campus are open or operational, we again refer you to the TAMU Keep Learning site, which can provide you with the most up-to-date information. Like many of you, we’re deeply disappointed that this historic global pandemic has caused us to adjust certain cherished traditions that mean so much to so many Aggies. But I want to assure you that Muster in College Station and graduation ceremonies in May will still happen, just in a different way. We encourage students and families to celebrate with us virtually, keeping the Aggie spirit strong and connected, even as we are separated by distance. For those who do not have an opportunity to participate in graduation ceremonies in May, we are searching for ways to expand our in-person events in August. Our university enjoys one of the strongest networks in the world, and I know the economic pressures many of you face are real. To that end, I want to thank the dedicated leaders and teams at The Association of Former Students, The 12th Man Foundation, and The Texas A&M Foundation for always answering the call when we need them. Finally, because people like you always have a heart to serve and a desire to take care of other Aggies, many of you have contacted me asking how you can help during this difficult time. At the moment, our biggest need is support for our students whose lives have been dramatically disrupted by this unprecedented pandemic. Many face a number of unexpected expenses. Our goal is to help ensure that they can finish their classes, graduate on time, and move to serve our state, our nation and the world. We have now created a relief fund for our students administered by the university. If you’ve been looking for an opportunity to show your support, we would be delighted if you would donate to our student relief fund, which you can find here. During this unprecedented moment, thank you for your steadfast dedication and devotion to Texas A&M. All of us are deeply grateful for your passion for our university and for your compassion for our students. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'April 1, 2020, 3:50 p.m. CDT Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19 News Site Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Families and the Aggie Network, In recent weeks, our news feeds have been dominated by stories about the coronavirus (COVID-19). Behind the scenes at Texas A&M, many other stories are unfolding. These are the stories of hope and healing, of triumph over tragedy, of great compassion and selfless service. They are stories of faculty and staff who have risen to the occasion, of scholars and researchers creating innovations – sometimes by the hour – to meet emerging needs, of students who serve, of leading experts providing essential advice, of Aggies going above and beyond the call of duty. Today we launch a new site, Texas A&M Responds: COVID-19, created to house these exceptional stories in one place, to include some featured globally. Many more stories will be added here. You’ll see accounts of nurses graduating early to put their lives on the line so that they might save the lives of others. You’ll read about engineers who’ve designed a method for making protective masks, a mobile clinic transformed from a converted shipping container by creative students, as well as trusted advice about how to keep your loved ones safe and secure. From innovation to virtual engagement, from the economy to our society, from animals and agriculture to government and health, this informative site gives a glimpse of the extraordinary breadth and depth of knowledge and experience that Texas A&M brings to bear during this global pandemic. Texas A&M is a public university. We’re also a major force for the public good. As you read these stories, I hope you’ll take heart in the efforts made by our students, faculty and staff, as well as the comfort in knowing that Aggies always step forward to serve in times of great need. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'April 3, 2020, 12:45 p.m. CDT Online Delivery for Summer Courses All summer courses offered through Texas A&M University in the first, second, and 10-week summer terms (including the May “minimester”) will be delivered online. We had hoped to resume coursework on campus for the second summer session, but with preregistration underway, some uncertainty on the apex of COVID19, and the need for both our students, faculty, and staff to plan, we have decided to move forward with the decision to teach all summer courses online. As we previously announced, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level for all students in traditional degree programs. For students enrolled in distance education degree programs, there is no change in how they will be charged. We continue to work with colleges to ensure that the university offers a robust schedule of summer coursework to ensure that students can make progress toward their degrees. As a reminder, please consult the main Texas A&M University COVID-19 website for regular updates, as well as keeplearning.tamu.edu. Carol A. Fierke Provost and Executive Vice President',\n",
       " 'April 3, 2020, 5:15 p.m. CDT Texas A&M faculty and staff who have access to personal protective equipment are being asked to donate whatever they can to help medical personnel and first-responders dealing with patients suffering from COVID-19. A&M has set up a survey that will go to officials with A&M’s Environmental Health and Safety department. They will then contact the individual to discuss collecting the items. Christina Robertson, Texas A&M’s director of Environmental Health & Safety who also serves on the logistics team for the Brazos County Community Emergency Operations Center, said she’s grateful for all the donations made to support the community’s healthcare providers and emergency responders. Officials with the county’s Emergency Operations Center said they can only accept manufactured items and are not able to take handmade masks or other supplies. ',\n",
       " 'April 29, 2020, 9:00 a.m. CDT On Monday, Governor Abbott issued three executive orders and announced that he will allow Executive Order GA-14 to expire on April 30, 2020. GA-14 was issued on March 31 and required Texans to stay at home except to access essential services or provide essential services as an employee, or to engage in daily essential activities (e.g. grocery shopping) or certain outdoor activities. In Executive Order GA-18 issued Monday, Governor Abbott allows certain businesses to re-open and operate at limited capacity, such as restaurants, retail stores and movie theaters. The new Executive Order GA-18 still specifies that \"every person in Texas shall, except where necessary to obtain essential services or reopened services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household.\" Specifically, the orders do not reduce most guidance for social distancing, gatherings of 10 or more people, personal hygiene or best practice regarding monitoring your personal health. Furthermore, social gatherings and events are still not permitted. OGC has analyzed the three executive orders issued on Monday and does not believe that they will have a significant impact on university operations, given the changes that we have already implemented. Thus, Texas A&M University will continue its current mode of operations until further notice. We will continue to monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our planning as changing conditions may require. At Texas A&M University, instruction, research and operations have already adjusted to previous guidance, as well as our own assessment of public health impacts across our campuses and educational sites. We will be continuing our standing guidance at this time. This includes: Completion of the Spring Semester via remote/online instruction and finals testing; Campuses and educational sites remain closed to visitors through May 31; Campus commencement ceremonies for Spring 2020 are postponed, with individual branch campus or professional schools providing information on their plans for their graduates. More information will be posted on the Texas A&M graduation page; Summer I, Summer II and 10 Week Summer session will all be delivered by remote/online instruction; Youth Camps on Texas A&M campuses and sites remain cancelled through June 30. Decision for July and August youth camps will be announced on or before May 15; A number of university facilities and services remain accessible to authorized personnel until June 1 with additional guidance expected on or before that date; University research operations remain limited, unless previously authorized by exception from Vice President for Research. Additional information about increasing research activity on campus will be forthcoming on or before May 18. Individual faculty and staff guidance issued by your supervisor remain in effect as appropriate and as updated to fit your individual responsibilities. Access will remain available to the workplace for employees, as is the case today, and most employees will continue to work remotely from home. We anticipate bringing more employees back to the workplace in the near future, and expect a phased approach that calls for the return of certain employees as soon as mid-May with other employees returning in June and still others in July or August. To the extent that work from home is possible, it should continue for medically vulnerable individuals and parents with children at home. We continue to monitor guidance from public health authorities, The Texas A&M University System, and The Office of the Governor to ensure appropriate health and safety for our university and communities. We anticipate additional guidance and announcements regarding our university operations no later than June 1. We appreciate your continued efforts to work, teach, learn and operate Texas A&M University in new and different ways at this time. We applaud your efforts which have helped to limit the impacts of COVID-19 and welcome your continued collaboration in the weeks and months to come. Remember to take care of each other, maintain social distancing, stay home if you are ill and practice frequent hand washing! Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",
       " 'April 30, 2020, 2:45 p.m. CDT A THANK YOU, ALONG WITH PLANS FOR SUMMER AND FALL Howdy Students, As the semester draws to a close, I cannot thank you enough for your flexibility and resilience, especially over the past six weeks. Just thinking about how you – the largest student body in the nation – rapidly responded to so many changes is both humbling and awe-inspiring: More than 1,000 of you quickly adapting international travel plans, with more than 280 of you safely returning from overseas and self-isolating when asked to do so; More than 57,000 of you participating in online classes, working with faculty across nearly 13,800 class sections; and Many of you answering the call to serve as only Aggies do – including nursing students who opted to expedite your instruction early and members of the military who were activated. Thank you! Next week, 10,796 of you are expected to graduate. While spring commencement, as we know, has been postponed, we will mark in a number of special ways the conferral of degrees. This summer, we’re fully online and enrollment is actually up, a sign that you remain undeterred in pursuing your goals. We will advise about plans for August commencement by the end of May. In the fall, our Aggiebound Aggies numbers are also up. While we know online classes are an option if needed, we plan to be fully open and operational, with dedicated faculty and staff leaning into preparing for all the requirements necessary to do so safely across academics, athletics and campus activities. We will continue to keep you updated in detail for plans to open responsibly, and will, of course, follow updated federal, state officials and healthcare guidance that dictate our ability to do so. It’s been quite a semester! We love you and wish you and your families safety and happiness as we continue to move forward together. Sincerely, Michael K. Young President',\n",

On Monday, you will receive the first issue of UNT Today, which will be distributed three days per week during the summer, then daily with the start of the new academic year in August. UNT Today will provide news, information about events, and other campus updates and announcements delivered to your inbox each morning.    News regarding opening campus    There are five committees charged with managing the re-entry/recovery process. The leads from each of those committees will meet once a week and will act as an advisory group to the President and Cabinet. In addition, each Vice President will provide more detailed information to their division about their specific re-entry plans within the UNT System and university-level guidance. The committees are: academics, research, student life, facilities and operations, and health and safety. Additional information will be shared as plans are developed and finalized.    UNT Professor Jean Keller in the Department of Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation and Tao Zhang, director of the Pediatric Movement and Physical Activity Laboratory, are participating in a collaborative research project with Scottish Rite for Children Hospital and several other local universities on the impact that social distancing and \"shelter-in-place\" has had on the activity levels of children across the U.S.    If you are caring for a child, please take a moment to complete this research survey, and share the survey with others via social media.    In an effort to keep our community as healthy as possible, UNT made the difficult decision to cancel all summer youth programs and camps that are offered on our campus and/or UNT programs hosted off-site. Our university is proud of the quality of the experiences our UNT summer camps provide to hundreds of youth every year, and we are saddened that we will not be able to welcome these young students and their families to our campus this summer.    f you coordinate one of the many youth summer camps, Nadia Guevara, Youth Protection Program director, will be reaching out with more information.

Our full-time staff have been identified as essential and have worked hard to provide food for our staff and first responders while keeping them safe and happy. We are going above and beyond in all necessary areas – from cooking delicious food (OOOOHHH OUR FAMOUS MAC AND CHEESE) and sharing smiles to cleaning and sanitizing commonly used or touched areas.

Student Health and Wellness Center (SHWC) Update:    The SHWC is available for students for all appointment reasons, without restrictions, including Walk-In STD testing. The hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.  The SHWC has expanded its telemedicine visits with medical providers, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and the dietitian. Not all issues are appropriate for this type of visit, so call and check on specifics.  The SHWC has implemented new precautions to protect the health and safety of students and staff. One notable addition is a mobile nurse’s station on the first floor of Chestnut Hall to take patient temperatures and confirm students have some type of face covering before entering the reception area on the 2nd floor. All staff will be wearing either a cloth face covering or a mask and have their temperature monitored each day. We also have increased our already aggressive cleaning protocols for all areas and high-touch surfaces as well as installed several large sneeze guards throughout the clinic.  The SHWC Pharmacy is available for students and staff with regular hours and additional safety precautions mentioned above.  Most SHWC staff, minus a few administrative employees continuing to telecommute, are back in the clinic, ready to assist students with any healthcare related need.  The SHWC Meadows Center for Health Resources will remain closed for the immediate future.  When UNT’s Risk Management Services put out a call on campus for supplies for mask making efforts, departments generously responded by donating UNT bandanas and rally towels. Watch this video to see how the Wise Mask Makers, volunteer seamstresses from Wise County, are using the fabric to make more than 350 masks for the UNT community.    Don’t forget to follow the CDC’s recommendations and wear your cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 to keep yourself and others safe.    Dining and Retail Update:    Dining Services will keep this schedule through Sunday, May 24, and retail hours will remain unchanged through May 31. In addition, Kerr Dining Hall will be closed May 25-31. It will re-open June 1 for Summer 5W1 and plans are being made to re-open additional retail options as more faculty/staff return to campus.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response:    Wendy Middlemiss, Ph.D., associate professor of Educational Psychology, wrote with the following recognition:    Our University and College of Education house the state office for the Home Instruction of Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY). HIPPY is a home visiting program providing families with activities helping at-risk children gain school readiness skills. Our state office oversees 11 program sites stretching from the DFW area to the Rio Grande Valley.    For Adriana Trevino, our director, and Janie Rojas, assistant director, the stay-at-home orders were met with an all-encompassing question: “What happens to a home visiting program when you can\\'t visit a home?”    Since mid-March, as districts and agencies closed their doors, Adriana and Janie spent hour upon hour answering that question for each of the 11 unique sites, often working well into the evening hours. They helped sites initiate plans for virtual home visits or home visits by phone for communities with limited Internet access. Our directors helped sites assure that their AmeriCorps-member home visitors remained in active status, and thus continued earning both an income and their education awards.    For Adriana and Janie, efforts to meet these program needs often paled in the face of finding ways of relieving the anxiety and stress experienced in each community. It is only because of their tireless dedication and hard work that HIPPY continues to provide for children’s educational needs and family well-being across our state.    To achieve these positive outcomes, Adriana and Janie attended numerous webinars learning the ins and outs of both HIPPY and AmeriCorps expectations. As well, they helped submit a federal planning grant proposal [which received approval and funding just this week] to help the program meet changing needs. Their efforts and hopefulness represent UNT’s community spirit in this time of need.

On top of this, he has an excellent social media presence on all platforms, including daily schedule reminders, motivational posts, and Instagram Live workouts.

Going above and beyond: Stories from UNT’s COVID-19 response  From Hepi Wachter, Ph.D., professor and chair in the Department of Design in the College of Visual Arts and Design:  I feel CVAD’s fashion design programis going above and beyond as we wrap up the semester. Professors Trippeer, Chang, Gam and Otto had a lot to “lift” transferring the fashion design senior show. (In the past, we would have enjoyed a fashion show in the Union.)  They have all been working hard to ensure student success, and in particular, aid our seniors to navigate what will obviously be a challenging transition into the industry.  Since restrictions were enacted during spring break and all senior fashion show exhibition opportunities were moved online, the fashion program was quick to enact their own form of the innovation imperative, and as such they have been strategically preparing our seniors to enter the workforce and get their materials out into the public without “running the show.”  As of April 22, each fashion design senior has not only completed a full digital online web-based portfolio, but also set up full LinkedIn profiles that are actively being used to engage with the fashion design industry. In lieu of the mounted show, they are developing it on www.untfashiondesigngrads.com by mid-May.  After weeks of intensive training through mock interview sessions, both in one-on-one sessions and through peers as small groups, the students are now “ready” to test their materials and solicit additional industry feedback.  As of last week, every single student has completed at least one information interview (and perhaps a few more) through our industry alumni network, and associated industry contact list.  We have also done thorough training on how to maximize key job search engines which exist in open source format (such as LinkedIn networking and Google Grow’s new job search platform), as well as other primary sources for industry networking (WWD, BOF, Fashion United, and StykeCareers).  Rather serendipitously, this unique moment and perhaps positive fallout of COVID-19 has allowed us to put more stress on these modes of delivery, which are often used as communication platforms, and based on current restrictions, will continue to become key survival skills. We believe they will become part of the “new-normal.”  If you know of someone who is going above and beyond, please share their information with untpresident@unt.edu so we can give them a shoutout.

Ever since the sent-home order was put into place, he has been coming to campus and still doing his daily duties instead of working from home, covering every issue that popped up in the field. He has kept us updated as well as the student workers who are still here and checks on those that have chosen to go home abroad. Raylon is very caring and giving. He would give you the shirt off his back. He always makes sure everyone around him is always ok, by keeping us supplied with masks and sanitizer. He is definitely the backbone of this department. I am proud to be his lead. He has taught me so much. He is a great mentor to us all. He is the T in TEAM.

During this time, we have all been adapting to virtual services, remote and online classes, and shelter in place. I hope you are doing well, that you are staying safe and healthy, and are making progress. Like me, I suspect you are looking forward to being together again to live, learn, and enjoy our rich campus experience.    Our leadership teams have been working hard to help us begin the transition from remote learning back to more normal campus operations. Today, I want to inform you that we plan to begin limited in-person teaching as early as Summer II and are planning on safely resuming campus learning and residential life for Fall 2020.    As we plan for our return to campus, the new normal will be different. Your safety is our top priority, and we will take every precaution to keep our community safe in this new world. We are assessing options and precautions for eventually returning to campus for all in-person activities and programs, ranging from lab-based research to general instruction and the undergraduate residential experience. Of course, these plans depend on continuing improvement in COVID-19 cases, and guidance from federal, state, and local health authorities to ensure your safety. We will be communicating in the coming weeks about what exactly you can expect when you return to campus.    This global health crisis also has had a financial impact on all of us. I want you to know if you need help of any kind you can get access to our many services at the Start Green Stay Green website (https://www.unt.edu/staygreen). We are here for you through these challenging times. Many of you have been hit hard by the current economy, and we are doing our best to balance easing financial burdens with providing the top quality UNT education and experience you deserve. If you are experiencing financial insecurity, please apply for assistance from our emergency grants-in-aid program available through the CARES Act. These funds are available now and are meant to help you pay your bills so you can stay in school and earn your degree as planned. Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA.

Our world has been shaken and that calls for a change in how we support you. We recognize that one of the biggest burdens many students are facing right now is financial insecurity. In an effort to ease some of the economic strain you may be experiencing, I want to let you know how UNT is trying to help.    First, we have made changes to the cost of enrolling in summer courses. For summer 2020 sessions, students will not have to pay some of the typical mandatory fees that help fund several support services on campus. This includes waivers of the Recreational Facility Fee, Student Union Fee, Medical Services Fee, Transportation Fee and Athletics Fee. We are able to do this because we have moved all in-person classes scheduled for the May session, Summer I and full summer sessions to online/remote delivery. Students can take advantage of these summer sessions and reduced costs to save money and stay on track to graduate on time.    Second, as you may already be aware, the federal government has provided a boost in student aid through the CARES Act. This funding allows us to greatly expand our emergency grants-in-aid program. This need-based aid is available for currently enrolled students as well as students who enroll in UNT summer sessions. The funds are intended to help students pay their bills and stay in school so they can earn their degrees as planned.    Applications for the emergency grants-in-aid program can be completed at https://tinyurl.com/UNTStudentSuccessFA. And, you can learn more about the cost of summer sessions by contacting Student Financial Services at sfs@unt.edu, online chat at sfs.unt.edu or by calling 940-565-3225.    I realize that emergency aid and fee waivers won't solve every problem. Times are tough, but so is our Mean Green Family. We will keep working on creative solutions to unprecedented problems. We will keep finding fresh ways to bring you the world-class education you deserve. You won't have to make it through these tough times alone. We're here to help you thrive because that's what we do.    UNT proud,   Neal Smatresk  UNT President\",\n",

At this time, our hope is that courses scheduled for on campus in Summer II will continue in person, but that could change based on recommendations from health officials and agencies.    In addition, and in recognition of the financial impact COVID-19 is having on our students, we will provide emergency financial relief to many of our students enrolled in summer courses, which will appear on student tuition and fee statements in the coming weeks. We are doing everything possible to find ways to help students continue their education during the summer months.    Here is additional information regarding summer courses:    Summer financial aid is available, including summer Pell Grant awards for eligible students. For more information, please visit https://summer.unt.edu/fund-summer.  Summer 2020 registration is now open.  Registration can be completed online through MyUNT.  For specific information, please refer to the Summer 2020 Registration Guide, which includes key dates.  All Registration and academic record services can be conducted virtually. Please see the Student “How to…” chart at https://registrar.unt.edu/.  I am counting on our creativity, caring and resilience to guide the path for our Mean Green family to get through this global health crisis — and emerge stronger than ever. You are all doing an amazing job, and I thank you for all you have done during these challenging times.    Stay strong and support each other because, no matter the physical distance we are required to maintain, we can remain socially close and connected. #PhysicallyDistantSociallyClose    UNT Proud,  Neal Smatresk  President',\n",

He’s been working during the pandemic to sanitize campus buildings, stock restrooms and accomplish small cleaning projects taking advantage of the vacant buildings across UNT.  One recent morning, while preparing for a special cleaning project, he heard dripping water in the Environmental Education, Science and Technology Building and discovered a failed research system pumping water into the building. Mr. Cross notified a stand-by technician to get the leak stopped, contacted his supervisor and manager to rally a team to assist and began gathering and using water extraction equipment.  Van’s attentiveness and quick response saved “many thousands of dollars in clean-up and restoration costs,” according to Randy Salsman of the Facilities Maintenance construction team that is overseeing the recovery and repairs to the building. Associate Vice President of Facilities Dave Reynolds says, “Van Cross is representative of many of the Facilities Team and others across the campus who are unselfishly taking care of our campus and students during a unique time in history. We should all be proud to work with such teammates.”  If you know of someone who is going above and beyond, please share their information with untpresident@unt.edu so we can give them a shoutout.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your feelings with us, as well as your patience while we worked through the logistics. For your benefit, we have made the following changes applicable to Spring 2020 undergraduate courses:    Undergraduate students can choose either the university’s regular A-F grading scheme or Pass/No Pass for Spring 2020 courses on their academic record.  Students earning grades A-C will have these grades posted to their record at the time of grading. A student can elect to change their A-C grades to a Pass after grades post.  Students earning a grade of D or F will have a grade of No Pass entered by a faculty member, unless the student notifies their instructor otherwise before grading. Students can elect to change the No Pass grade back to the D or F after grades post.  Students can make different choices for different classes, choosing to keep some letter grades, and choosing others to remain Pass/No Pass.  Letter grades will continue to calculate in a student’s grade point average. Pass and No Pass options do not calculate in grade point averages.  Students will have until 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 14, to select a change to Pass for letter grades and to change No Pass grades back to a D or F based on the grade earned.  For graduate students, each graduate program is prepared to provide flexibility, as appropriate, to support student success.    To learn more about the Pass/No Pass Option, visit https://registrar.unt.edu/grades. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisor prior to making any grade election decisions.

       " 'Campus officials have been notified of two additional, confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UNT.    One of the cases involves a staff member, who has no interaction with students and very little interaction with other university staff. It has been approximately 10 days since the individual last worked on campus, and any potential impacted parties have been notified.    The other case is a UNT student living alone in off-campus housing who has not been on campus since mid-March. The student already has completed the mandatory self-isolation and any potential impacted parties have been notified.    It is very important to follow the guidelines set forth by Denton County’s shelter-at-home order. Students living in residence halls must comply. The order only allows them to leave for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, picking up meals from campus dining, visiting a healthcare professional, or engaging in outdoor activity such as walking, hiking, running or riding a bicycle – with proper social distancing.    UNT officials have received reports of reduced service levels with some online platforms such as Zoom as more organizations worldwide reduce in-person meetings. Stories include having trouble with being kicked out of Zoom meetings or experiencing audio or video issues.    CIO Chris McCoy suggests turning off your VPN if you are using a UNT laptop and minimizing the number of applications running in the background. Zoom uses a considerable amount of memory, and open apps can result in processing issues. Since Zoom is a cloud service, VPN video data is encrypted and routed through campus firewalls before being sent unencrypted back out onto the internet to the Zoom servers. By turning VPN off, computers off campus are communicating directly with the Zoom servers without being routed through the campus.    Finally, when you run Zoom on an iPad, it is only running Zoom, not multiple apps.

       " 'Dear UNT family,    There is no handbook for handling a global pandemic. There is no guide for navigating a world flipped upside down and inside out. We are human and with that humanity comes anxiety, vulnerability, fears, stress and selfishness. But when I look at our UNT community, those are not the traits I see. We are strong, resilient, brave, determined, creative, unified and selfless. Our Mean Green family was made to tackle times exactly like these.    I want to take a moment to share with you some of the examples of hope I’ve seen from our community in recent weeks. With less than two months remaining in the semester, our faculty halted their entire worlds and reimagined nearly 8,000 courses to find creative solutions to very unique problems. Our faculty stepped into the discomfort of the unknown because being there for our students who need to finish the semester successfully is more important. None of these herculean efforts would be possible without the support staff across the university, many of whom are tackling a variety of issues to keep our university going for our students and our community — and most are doing this from their own newly adapted home office environments. None of these changes have been simple or easy, but every single issue we’ve addressed has been to help our students succeed.    To all UNT students, you inspire us every day. You are the reason we continue moving forward. You, too, have hurdled countless obstacles and adapted to an ever-changing reality while admirably managing many stressors. You have done so with fearless spirit. Keep going. We are ready to help you climb mountains. You need only ask.    We also have hundreds of students who continue to call our campus residence halls home. To the staff who are caring for those students, feeding and housing them, protecting them, you are the epitome of the community values we hold dear. To the students, we remain sensitive to the toll this unprecedented crisis is having on you who are having to adjust not only in your learning but in many cases now are unable to work or be with your families. If you would like to show your support during these challenging times, we’ve established a special fund to help our students with immediate and pressing needs.    Our values also are evident among our alumni, who are proving that we truly are all Eagles for life. Once again, “Mattress Mack” Jim McIngvale is providing for the Houston community — this time by distributing meals to children and seniors. Lecrae has joined forces with the organization Love Beyond Walls to set up handwashing stations in Atlanta for the homeless; and fashion designer Khanh Nguyen has taken fabric she normally uses for her stunning wedding gowns to sew masks for health care professionals in Dallas.    You can read more about our alumni and some of their amazing efforts in supporting others during this crisis, as well as take time to read about university happenings in the spring issue of the North Texan magazine online. You also can find inspirational stories about our faculty, staff and students here. We will continue to post more of these online as we collect them and encourage all of you to share with us how you or someone you know has been making a difference during this time.    I continue to be amazed every day by the support, resilience and ingenuity displayed by our students, staff, faculty and alumni when every hour seems to bring more change and more necessary adaptations. Continue to care for one another. Continue to help each other through these challenges. As difficult as it may feel in this moment, we are becoming a stronger, more connected community through this shared experience. Let’s stay together in spirit and unity of purpose as the Mean Green family I am so very proud to call my own.    UNT proud,  Neal Smatresk  UNT President',\n",

Those of you who rely on income from campus jobs have expressed your concerns over whether we will be able to provide you with financial assistance. The short answer is we will provide support to all student workers who were employed in the week before spring break, but have been unable to return to work because of the pandemic.    You will be paid 20 hours per week for the first two weeks of April. This paycheck will come to you in the same manner in which you received your most recent paycheck; either via direct deposit or mail, on May 1.

But these last few weeks, his calm and steady leadership has truly made a difference. Day by day, he kept everyone informed with clear emails detailing step by step what we needed to do next, sometimes even with a measured dose of humor. He also constructed a webpage with helpful tips for teaching online. Moreover, he went out of his way to ensure that all instructional personnel had the necessary resources to start teaching online, ordering tablets, webcams and document cameras for whoever needed them, and with his physical presence he kept up morale among the staff who had to keep coming into the office until the very last moment when the department was already a ghost town. Thanks to Ralf's leadership, the Mathematics Department experienced a remarkably smooth transition.

UNT already had announced a campus transition to essential operations only, which began at 5 p.m. yesterday, March 24.    We must all take this \"stay-at-home\" order to heart. It is essential for the health and safety of our community that we reduce our population density to slow the spread of this virus.    Students living in residence halls must comply with the \"stay-at-home\" order. The order allows students to leave their residence only for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, picking up meals from campus dining, visiting a healthcare professional, or engaging in outdoor activity such as walking, hiking, running or riding a bicycle – with proper social distancing.    We understand that for some students, UNT is their home and, as such, we have an added responsibility to ensure their health and safety on our campus. We will continue to maintain specific, essential, on-campus services for students who need them, including:    Meal service for our on-campus residents will be provided with to-go options from Kerr Cafeteria.  The Union is closed with the exception of Eagle Post, which is open 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.  For students feeling anxiety or stress, Counseling Services remain available.

Please reach out to the Denton Community Food Center for assistance.  All other university services, and campus access for non-campus residents, have moved to virtual service only.  We are in uncharted territory as we face this global pandemic together. I am amazed every day by the support, resilience and ingenuity displayed by our students, staff and faculty when every hour seems to bring more change, more necessary adaptations, and more uncertainty.    As difficult as it may feel in this moment, we are becoming a stronger, more connected community through this shared experience. Someday soon we will be together again to live, learn and play.

The personal impact on each of us and our normal routine on and off campus is great, which is why I am writing to share news about Commencement with you today.  After much consideration, I have decided to postpone Commencement ceremonies that were scheduled for May 7-10. Our spring commencement is the last major event to be impacted, and the decision was not made quickly in order to thoroughly consider whether we could begin returning to normal operations in early May. While we should all remain optimistic about where we could be with the fight against coronavirus (COVID-19) in 45 days, families of May graduates need to know now whether to make travel arrangements.  I know that crossing the stage is a defining moment for our students who have worked so hard to earn their degree(s), so please know that many people across campus are currently reviewing ways to still allow commencement to happen later in the year for any graduate wishing to participate. Whatever is decided, spring graduates will have an opportunity to participate in an in-person ceremony and cross the stage at a commencement ceremony, but you will officially graduate regardless of whether we hold a ceremony or not. As soon as we make a decision regarding these later ceremony options, we will share that information with our community.

It is important for us to pause for a moment and consider how our thoughts, our words, and our actions influence others in our community who are equally affected by this global health crisis.    As we all know, words can hurt, and can substantially interfere with our students' educational access and our employees’ work opportunities. UNT will not tolerate harassing behavior toward our community members who are or may appear to be of Asian descent. Let me be clear when I state that this is not who we are as a community.    As we move into online instruction, we expect UNT students, faculty, staff, and administrators to refrain from any identity-based jokes, slurs, harassment, or exclusion against any member of the Mean Green Family. The UNT policy on “Prohibition of Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation” is still in effect despite these new ways of learning and working and will be enforced. Should you experience or witness a violation of this policy committed by a student, we encourage you to report it to the Dean of Students Office at report.unt.edu.

       " 'Our campus health teams and executive leadership have been continuously following the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19), with a focus on safeguarding the well-being of our students, staff, faculty and community.   There are no confirmed cases at UNT or in Denton County at this time, but we have seen reported cases in Collin, Dallas and Tarrant counties over the past week. As a result, we are taking the following steps to protect our campus community:  UNT will cancel all in-person classes at all locations for the week of March 16-22, as the university transitions to online or alternative instructional delivery. Online classes and field experiences will continue as normal the week of March 16-22. All instruction will resume on Monday, March 23.  By March 19, you will learn details about your classes via your UNT email. We will be communicating with you further in the interim.  During the week of March 16-22, students are encouraged to stay off campus, if possible. For students who are currently on campus or for those who need to return, residence halls and dining facilities will be open.  Faculty and staff will continue working on campus. All other business services will be available. Student workers should check with their supervisors regarding work schedules. In addition, we are taking these precautions involving travel and events:   We are suspending university-sponsored international travel until further notice. Only domestic travel necessary for essential business continuity will be supported until further notice. Guidelines for essential business continuity travel will be established by the Vice Presidents of each area.  Faculty, staff or students returning from countries with travel restrictions or visiting our campus from a country with travel restrictions will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days, with monitoring provided by our Student Health and Wellness Center. We ask all employees and students returning from personal international travel or highly impacted areas domestically to please report their trip to international risk control at 940-369-6154 for further guidance. Beginning March 23, events with more than 250 people that don’t affect business continuity will be canceled or postponed. As you make decisions about returning to campus, please consider the CDC’s criteria for people considered to be at higher risk, including older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. If you or a member of your household falls into one of the high-risk groups as identified by the CDC, such that you may be advised by a health authority not to come to work, please let Human Resources know at 940-565-2281 or AskHR@untsystem.edu.  As we move to implement these changes quickly, we understand that we will face a number of challenges, and we are grateful and appreciative of your cooperation and support. Please watch your email for regular updates and visit healthalerts.unt.edu for information regarding UNT’s response and preparedness. Thank you for pulling together to keep our campus safe and to support our students.  Sincerely, Neal Smatresk President',\n",

       " 'Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,  The University of Houston has been closely monitoring the emerging outbreak in China of the novel Coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV since its announcement to the public this month, and we maintain regular contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest information.  Raising awareness and keeping the University community well informed of this rapidly evolving situation is very important.  Since the first case was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, there have been a growing number of reported cases including several in the United States.  We have not identified any cases at our UH campuses.  There have been no reported cases in Texas at this time. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers this new Coronavirus to be a serious public health threat, they consider the immediate risk to the American public to be low at this time.  In regard to this new Coronavirus and general preventive measures, we feel it is important for staff, faculty and students to:      Recognize the symptoms of this illness which may include a high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, similar to what you may feel with the flu or a bad cold.     Seek care and immediately notify the University if you have recently traveled within China and are experiencing these symptoms.     Always practice good hygiene, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid sharing food, cups or utensils.     Make sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid personal contact with sick people.     Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, shared items; and lastly,     Get a flu shot.  The incubation period (how soon the symptoms appear from the time of first exposure) for this kind of virus is typically 10-14 days.  Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections, including infections with 2019-nCoV.  Seeking care  For Students  Those who have recently visited China and are experiencing influenza-like illness, with fever greater than 100.3, and symptoms, including cough, body aches, severe sore throat, or runny nose, should consider seeking medical attention for the possibility of the flu, especially if symptoms worsen.  You can contact the Student Health Center at 713-743-5151 and identify yourself as having flu-like symptoms.  You may also consult with your regular health care provider or seek treatment at a local health center if you are overseas.  Faculty and staff who are ill with flu-like symptoms should stay home and contact their personal physician for further advice.  Travel  The University encourages the UH Community to heed U.S. Government warnings related to travel in China due to the uncertainty about where and how rapidly the virus is spreading, as well as limited capacity to assist travelers impacted by travel disruption or quarantine while abroad. The CDC currently recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to the Hubei Province, China including Wuhan and follow new developments at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/china#travel-notices. In addition, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Travel Advisory to reconsider travel to China.  For additional information about Coronavirus, including signs and symptoms, transmission and risk of exposure, and what to do if you are exhibiting symptoms, please refer to the links below.  The CDC’s website and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will also issue guidance for those planning to travel or who have recently returned.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html  https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/  Sincerely,  Dr. Vanessa Tilney Chief Physician, Student Health Center University of Houston UHPHU@central.uh.edu 713-743-5151',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,  At this time, the University of Houston System is prohibiting all travel to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and non-essential travel to China outside of Hubei Province in adherence to U.S. Federal Government travel warnings resulting from the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV.  While the UH System places great value in our work and on our many partnerships in China, including exchange programs, and intends to continue these initiatives, our highest priority is the health and wellbeing of our UH System Community. At this time, the health risks associated with the uncertainty about where in China and how rapidly the virus is spreading, outweigh our institutions’ academic and research endeavors and necessitate travel restrictions.  On Jan. 27, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory to China, recommending reconsideration of travel to anywhere in that country, as well as a Level 4 Travel Advisory to completely restrict travel to Wuhan and Hubei Province. On Jan. 23, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan and Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions in the area.  Also on Jan. 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended its Warning Level 3 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where the first case of the new Coronavirus was identified, to now include all of China. A Warning Level 3 instructs individuals to “avoid all non-essential travel to this destination. The outbreak is of high risk to travelers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk.”  The UH System remains in close contact with our federal, state and local government partners and will continue to monitor this situation closely. While we regret any temporary disruptions to our endeavors in the region, we look forward to fully re-engaging at such time the health risk to our UH System Community associated with the new Coronavirus has diminished.

We will continue to keep our community informed as developments occur. To date, we have not identified any cases at our UH campuses. However, as Coronavirus has become much more prominent in the United States and has begun to spread more rapidly through parts of Europe and Asia, it is incumbent upon all of us to remain aware and vigilant of this potentially serious public health threat.  Travel  The UH System is restricting travel to all countries for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Warning to avoid all nonessential travel related to Coronavirus. The CDC applies this warning to countries in which there is widespread community transmission. At this time, the CDC has issued the Level 3 Travel Warning to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Due to rapidly changing conditions, anyone considering international travel is advised to monitor the CDC’s website for the latest updates regarding travel and COVID-19.

       " 'UHS Faculty, Staff and Students,  We continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities. The international profile of our universities, which includes routine travel abroad in both official and personal capacities, means we must be especially vigilant in determining when anyone in our universities has become potentially exposed to the virus and take responsible actions to contain and prevent its spread.  The University of Houston System has issued a COVID-19 Exposure Prevention Statement It requires any students, faculty or staff returning from travel to countries under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Level 2 or Level 3 Travel Warning related to coronavirus to self-quarantine for a period of 14 days away from campus. This ensures that anyone who has returned and develops symptoms of COVID-19 will not inadvertently spread the virus to others on our campuses.  As Spring Break approaches, it is important for anyone considering personal international travel especially to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy or Japan  to clearly understand the implications on their return to the United States and to campus.  As Chancellor, my number one priority is to ensure that our universities remain safe and healthy.  For a detailed explanation of this policy statement and additional information about COVID-19, please visit this UHS website.  Sincerely,  Chancellor, University of Houston System',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty:  There are now five confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Houston area. Should those numbers increase in the next days and weeks, the primary public health effort will be to reduce the spread of infection by limiting the amount of time large groups of people spend together in close proximity.  In the event of a large-scale COVID-19 outbreak, the University of Houston will join this public health effort by cancelling all in-person, face-to-face classes and limiting face-to-face, one-on-one instruction until such time as it is advisable to return to campus.  Should we face a large-scale outbreak, as an alternative to conducting in-person, face-to-face classes, the University of Houston will require all faculty instructors to teach their current spring 2020 classes employing a remote, online format, using either the Blackboard or CourseWare learning management systems. All spring 2020 classes currently have a Blackboard class shell which can be accessed by faculty instructors through the Blackboard Learn portal icon via the AccessUH page.

As I assured you last Wednesday, we continue to follow closely the global spread of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our university communities.  There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 on our campuses; however, there have been some cases identified in and around Houston. According to reports, all of these cases involve foreign travel.  It is the time to exercise prevention, not panic. The safety of our faculty, staff and students is our top priority. We must take all necessary precautions suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but we must also commit to playing our role in containing the outbreak of the virus in our community. With this in mind, I am providing you with the following information.  Communication regarding COVID-19  The UH Health Liaison, Dr. Vanessa Tilney and the UH Office of Emergency Management continue to work with local, state and national authorities on a daily basis. Any and all updates related to the university’s operations will be available on the UH COVID-19 (Coronavirus) webpage which you can access from uh.edu.  You will receive emails and alerts as necessary but I am asking you to please keep checking updates on the webpage because this situation can change rapidly.  Travel is restricted  The University of Houston is now restricting all international travel at least through the end of March and is continuing to require off-campus self-quarantine of 14 days for traveling to any country on CDC’s travel warning list at Level 2 or Level 3 for COVID-19.  Written approval is required before any student may return to campus after self-quarantine. For your own safety and the safety of those around you, please consider your risks and options carefully when making decisions regarding personal travel.  If you must travel abroad (to any international location), you are instructed to register on the UH COVID-19 website.

The University of Houston is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.     Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please  evaluate your options carefully.      Consider your risks and options when making decisions about personal travel.

Continuity of Classes      In adherence to university policies, each college/department has a “Continuity of Operations Plan” on file.  Provost Short has asked deans and department chairs to ensure that everyone is familiar with their plan and that classes could continue if we have to limit access to campuses.     In certain circumstances and if instructed by local, state or federal authorities, all in-person classes may migrate to the digital platform.  In cases where pedagogy is not suitable for online instruction, individual faculty should make alternative arrangements so the semester is not disrupted. Every course already has a shell on Blackboard; however if you need any help, workshops are offered by the Office of the Provost.     We will keep small computer equipped areas on campus open for those students who do not have access to a laptop.  Continuity of Research      Please evaluate your needs in relation to your research. Since every researcher has different needs, please make sure that your dean and department chair are aware of your situation so that appropriate accommodations can be made.      You may also contact the Division of Research for any questions and/or concerns.     Additional information for researchers will be forthcoming from the Provost and Vice President for Research.  Continuity of Other Campus Operations      Each support unit will evaluate its “Continuity of Operations Plan.” We are asking all unit heads to familiarize their teams with their unit’s plan.     We do not expect to cancel classes or close the University. Please note that essential support functions will continue and staff may be directed to work from home.  Communication and Update  We expect the situation to change on a daily basis.  While we are prepared to send emails and alerts as and when necessary, please see the University of Houston COVID-19 webpage for the latest updates and actions.

       " 'Dear Department Chairs and Associate Deans for Research:  We are aware our researchers need access to laboratories should we have to work remotely. With that in mind, please review and share the guidance below concerning access to laboratories with your faculty members and principal investigators.        For those individuals who need access to labs because of ongoing research activities (i.e. faculty, students, technical and research staff), they should be listed as essential personnel in the department’s Continuity of Operations Plan delineating not only who they are, but also where will they be working. This information should be prepared by the department and be readily available if requested by the Office of the Provost, the Division of Research, UH Police Department, or Emergency Services.            Principal Investigators are required to establish clear written protocols for who should individuals call or contact if there are any health and safety issues that arise when working in the lab with minimal supervision from senior faculty and/or staff.            Principal Investigators are asked to be mindful of the interactions between them, their students, or their research staff to limit physical interactions.            Additional sanitation is mandatory for work-stations, lab bench-tops, communal equipment, and common areas that each individual has been in contact with before and after they visit the lab.            Principal Investigators should cancel all lab meetings and significant gatherings during this time and organize virtual lab meetings through the Microsoft Teams software that all UH employees have access to, or allow faculty to create Blackboard shells for their lab groups as if they were a class. Both platforms have the capability for real-time online virtual meetings, written information sharing, and/or communications.            Principal Investigators are required to consider delaying the start of activities that require lab personnel to congregate (e.g. additional in-person training, tasks that require multiple personnel).            If there are regular recurring  lab activities that require by policy more than one person to perform (e.g. liquid nitrogen tank filling, equipment change outs, etc.), then the Principal Investigators should designate a specific team of the same individuals to perform those recurring tasks during the time there is limited access to the labs.            It is expected that the UH Animal Care Organization will take all the steps above, taking into account the special needs of animal husbandry and other necessary daily operations and maintenance.           Principal Investigators who are currently conducting research involving human subjects should, if appropriate and does not increase risk to subjects, consider postponing data collection activities. The Research Integrity and Oversight (RIO) Office in the Division of Research will be issuing additional guidance to those investigators with active research protocols. For any immediate questions concerning human research projects, please contact the RIO Office (cphs@central.uh.edu).  If you have any questions, please email provost@uh.edu and we will route them to the appropriate individual.',\n",

       " 'Dear Staff:  Following the recent announcement from President Khator, it’s important to note that the University, including the University of Houston at Katy and the University of Houston at Sugar Land, will remain open, and all offices and services will continue operations at this time.  While this is a very rapidly evolving situation, we currently do not anticipate any change in the services provided at each location or instructional site.  Please know that should there be any changes to our operational status, you will be notified by an official announcement from the University accordingly.  As part of overall ongoing response and business continuity processes and procedures, your health and safety as a valued team member is our utmost priority.  In support, we have taken several actionable steps in this regard, including the following:  Health and Hygiene      Increased cleaning and sanitation protocols for facilities, including all food service locations and high-volume “touchpoints,” such as commonly used door handles, elevators, vending machine areas, among many others, as well as the deployment of hand sanitizer dispensers, and discontinuing the self-service option at all dining locations.     We are also rigorously following the “Guidance for Workplaces and Businesses” as outlined by the City of Houston Health Department.    Temporary Telecommuting Workplace Arrangement Request Process  As a result of this rapidly evolving response, there may be circumstances where a flexible workplace arrangement may be an effective alternative within your team, program office or department if you are able to continue to perform your work functions from a remote location.   Please know that the approval of a flexible workplace arrangement will be considered by your immediate supervisor and next level leader on an individual basis. As with any temporary arrangement, your immediate supervisor and/or next level leader may discontinue the flexible workplace initiative at any time.  To proceed with the process to request working remotely on a temporary basis, the following University of Houston Telecommuting request form https://uh.edu/human-resources/forms/uhs-telecommuting_form.pdf is required for completion by each employee to be submitted to your immediate supervisor to begin the review and approval process.  Helpful Resources  As these are extremely anxious and uncertain times, it’s important to note that there are additional resources provided by the University, including the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), telemedicine, and elder/child care service options. For more detail on benefits eligibility, please click here: https://uh.edu/human-resources/hr-communications/benefit-services-communication-3.11.2020.pdf  All departments should review and update your Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) and share them with your staff to ensure essential functions can continue if a disruption of service occurs.

       " 'Dear Faculty and Staff,  Since my last communication regarding the university’s response to COVID-19, President Trump as well as state and local officials have announced additional efforts to slow its spread, or “flatten the curve.\"  Following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and federal, state and local health officials, my leadership team has been working to adjust operations with regard to the health, wellbeing and safety of our UH community.   I encourage you to consult our website regularly.  The University of Houston is open for operation and services. No classes are being held this week and all of the instruction and most of the operations will be conducted remotely from March 23 until at least April 4.   To comply with guidelines issued by the City of Houston, all retail and dining establishments on campus will convert to takeout orders only, effective immediately. Social distancing procedures are being introduced in residence halls, libraries, workspaces and student spaces.  A decision with regard to commencement will be made next week.  The purpose of this communication is to put things in perspective and offer you additional guidelines as it comes to your day-to-day decision-making.  In the coming weeks, our goals are:      To continue our educational mission by offering instruction and support services to students.     To keep university functions and services operational.     To attend to resident students still living in university housing.     To attend to the needs of those students most in need, whether financial, academic, mental, physical or otherwise.     To keep the research labs operational and productive.     To keep all facilities fully sanitized and clean by following the protocols of the CDC.  To this effect here are some important things you should know:      Faculty and staff may work from home to the extent they are able to perform job functions remotely and with appropriate approval from their supervisors. More clarity will be forthcoming from Human Resources to answer questions that you might have.     The University is open for those who need to physically come in and for those who are asked to come in due to the nature of their work. Please continue to take the preventive actions as recommended by the CDC.     With guidance from the CDC and local officials, we discourage events with groups of 10+.     We are committed to protecting your salary and benefits irrespective of your job category to the fullest extent possible based on state requirements.  We want you to take care of yourself and your family and to do your part in the controlling the outbreak.  We also want to find ways for you to balance your personal and professional lives.     Many people may have questions about COVID-19 or begin to experience a variety of heightened emotions during this period of uncertainty.  Please know that UH has resources available that can provide support for you including the following:         Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers a dynamic array of services intended to meet your needs where you are.  The phone number is 713.743.5454.         Current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students can connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat using Telehealth.         Employees can visit the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to find self-help tools and learn more about the resources available.  Employees can also call to schedule a free, confidential appointment with one of their many skilled professionals     We have reestablished our Cougars Care SharePoint sites for faculty and staff to help one another with resources or support during these next few weeks.  You can locate this service on AccessUH.    My team and I are committed to the fair treatment of all involved and are seeking flexibility and guidance from the state. We are also in constant touch with other university systems and conferring about best practices.  This is uncharted territory, and these goals cannot be accomplished without your help, dedication and creativity. I know you care about your work, our common mission, and most of all our students. In the city of Houston and in the Cougar Nation, we rise to the occasion when called upon.  Thank you for your dedication and commitment. Follow health protocols and stay healthy.  With warm regards, Renu Khator',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty and Staff,  I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Thank you so much for working so diligently to face the crisis and for the solutions you’ve provided no matter what the challenge. I am proud and grateful to be with you. Most of you are working from home but some of you are on campus keeping the essential services going and/or leading the troops.  My team and I thank you all, but particularly those who are on campus.  I wanted to let you know that after careful consideration and consultation, we have made the following three decisions. You can refer to my letter to students for more details.      All classes will be offered remotely for the rest of the Spring Semester.           Graduation ceremonies have been postponed until late summer/early fall.           In the context of the current  breakdown of our economy and the long road ahead, the Board of Regents has asked us to not take any new financial obligations because they (and we, too) are witnessing layoffs and pay cuts in almost all businesses around us.  To comply with this directive and to be committed to the people already on the payroll, I have asked vice presidents to put a 30-day pause on signing off on any kind of new financial obligation including hires, contracts, procurement, etc.  During this time, we can come together and work out different scenarios and see what our best options are. This is not a hiring freeze but a 30-day pause to carefully formulate our strategy through the process of shared governance. Your guidance through deans/directors or Faculty Senate/Staff Council will be extremely important.  Thank you again for your dedication, commitment and engagement.  With warm regards, Renu Khator',\n",
       " 'Dear Students --  During this very difficult situation, we have been listening intently to you and your families.  Preserving health and safety has been first and foremost in every step we have taken and every decision we’ve made.  In the final analysis,  our students and UH community are who matter most to us. With that in mind, the following decisions have been made:  ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, STUDENT LIFE, AND EVENTS      Spring 2020 courses will be offered remotely (online or alternative format) beginning March 23 and for the duration of the semester. We are currently working through details on online test proctoring, labs and other considerations. I am asking faculty members, deans and university leaders to work to accommodate student needs throughout these difficult times.  Computer labs are open for those who need them and resources for off-campus Wi-Fi are available from UIT.            Spring 2020 Commencement will be postponed. Canceling graduation would be detrimental to all of the hard work our students have done to earn their degrees. We will begin planning for a late summer or early fall commencement as soon as public health conditions and operational guidelines allow.  Delaying the graduation/commencement ceremonies will not delay the actual conferring of degrees to May graduates. The latest updates, including new information about cap and gown orders, and rescheduled dates can be found here as the information becomes available.           Events sponsored by the University are canceled, no matter the size, through the end of April.  Rather than continuing to provide updates based on the latest federal, state or local size limitations, we prefer to provide clear guidance for the near term.  These restrictions include conferences, symposia, and social gatherings.  This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.  STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES      Residential housing will remain open for those who choose to stay or return and complete your course work remotely for the remainder of the semester.  If you plan to move out of housing and not continue in housing through the remainder of the semester, please follow the process that Student Housing & Residential Life will outline for you soon.  You will receive further information about the refund/credit of your unused amount for these services in addition to parking.  We will work with you on any specific needs, and we thank you for your patience.           All dining establishments operating on campus, retail and residential, have converted to takeout orders only to comply with guidelines issued by the city of Houston and to promote social distancing.  More information on unused balances on dining plans will be communicated in the next week.  For more information on hours and locations, please visit dining services.      Cougar Cupboard  in partnership with the Houston Food Bank is open and available for students who require access to additional food.           M. D. Anderson Library will remain open with computer labs available to those in need and online material available for access. Beginning March 23, access to the library will be limited to UH students, faculty and staff.           UH Cougars Care community SharePoint is available to allow peer-to-peer support and help for faculty, staff and students.  Visit AccessUH to begin your conversations.           The Student Health Center will continue to be available for non-emergency, outpatient medical care to currently enrolled UH students.  Appointments may be scheduled by calling 713-743-5151 during regular business hours.           UH Counseling and Psychological Services is waiving session fees and/or no show and late cancel charges for all appointment types. CAPS remains open and will assess for the most appropriate treatment option which may include referrals/resources, crisis services, phone sessions, or an in-person appointment.           Telehealth is available for current United Healthcare – Service Resources member and non-member students to connect with a physician via phone and/or video chat.           The Campus Recreation and Wellness Center is temporarily suspending in-person workouts in the facility through April 4, but it is providing opportunities for remote workouts.           The Student Center is open, but closing each night at 10 p.m. until further notice.           Please refer to our university COVID-19 website for the latest updates and resources.  We are in the midst of an extraordinary challenge, and the situation continues to change rapidly.  But there is one thing that will not change – this University’s commitment to do what is best for our students.  We will work through this together, remaining safe and continuing our educational mission. I know we can do this.  With warm regards, Renu Khator',\n",
       " 'To the Campus Community:   I want to call your attention to important updates regarding COVID-19.  In order to safeguard the health and safety of our university community, any faculty, staff or student returning from any international travel or having close contact with anyone who has been confirmed to have COVID-19 will need to self-quarantine for 14-days and receive approval before returning to work/campus.  If you have not registered your international travel to any location outside the United States, you must do so before returning to campus.  Due to the increase in the number of cases related to community spread, we are implementing two new reporting requirements.  First, faculty, staff and students who have reason to believe that they have been exposed to an individual with a confirmed case of COVID-19 must report that information to the university.  Second, faculty, staff and students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must report that diagnosis to the university.

The CDC provides helpful information about these “nonpharmaceutical interventions”.  Employees will be sent home if they come to campus with symptoms of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.  We are a campus community that is rising to meet the challenge, adapting to different learning and working configurations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

       " 'Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,  Much has happened in our country since my last communication and we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. Cities and states are taking further measures to limit human contact and slow the spread of COVID-19.    Today, Harris County issued a Stay at Home order beginning at 11:59pm tonight through April 3. What does this mean for us?  Similar to universities in other cities and states which are under Stay-at-Home order, the University of Houston is expected to continue its operations remotely. As a state public university, we also continue to seek guidance from state authorities and work with other state universities on how to safely fulfill our mission and continue to operate. With this in mind, please note the following:      University of Houston will continue delivering instruction remotely, the process we began on Monday.  Faculty have transitioned thousands of courses online and will be flexible. Staff have been innovative in using new and creative ways to support students.  And students have been diligent in shifting to the online platform. Together, we will make it work.      A pass-fail option for this semester is currently under consideration by the appropriate faculty bodies. Any decision and details implementing it will be communicated before the end of the week.      Student Housing & Residential Life remain open until the end of the spring semester, however we are encouraging students who can go home safely, to go home until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted. Additionally, students who have already planned to move out may still move out today. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.      All UH locations will expand their social distancing efforts by reformatting programs and support services. It will involve less direct contact and more remote support. Check the COVID-19 website for more details.  This is an extraordinary time. Our own university community has confirmed two positive cases of COVID-19. In both cases, individuals had not been on campus and any person who may have been in contact with them has been notified.  Continue to check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information. Please take precaution and preventive measures whether you are 18 or 81.  We are one connected piece of society’s make-up and only we can help control the spread in our community.  Thank you for being a resilient Cougar.  We are all in it together and we will all pull through this together.  With warm regards,  Renu Khator',\n",
       " 'Dear Undergraduate Students:  In response to the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and upon recommendation by the Faculty Senate Undergraduate Committee, the University of Houston is implementing an Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy.  This policy provides students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis and applies to all undergraduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session.  The deadline for students to choose their grading option is 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.  Details regarding the process through which students make this choice will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar by April 27, 2020.  The University of Houston is taking these steps to help you be successful during our current extraordinary circumstances. Together, we will prevail and overcome all the challenges we face.  Warm regards, ',\n",
       " \"Dear Graduate and Professional Students:  The University of Houston wants you to continue to be successful in your courses this semester despite the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the University is implementing an interim policy for graduate grades that will benefit you and help mitigate these extraordinary circumstances we are facing.  The policy provides most graduate students with the option to choose Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NCR) grading on a course-by-course basis. Should you choose this option, it means that if your course's current grading scheme is Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grades of Satisfactory will remain the same, and grades of Unsatisfactory will convert to No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR).   If your course's current grading scheme is letter grade, then students with a grade of C- or higher may choose to receive the Satisfactory (S) grade instead of the letter grade. For grades below C-, students may choose to receive the No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) option instead of the letter grade.   I encourage you to read fully the policy online, but here are several key highlights:      The Interim Graduate Grade Policy applies to all graduate students in courses offered during Spring 2020 Sessions 1, 4, 5, and 6 as well as the 2020 Summer Mini Session. The policy will be reviewed for continuation through future terms if necessary. Professional students should check the full policy to determine eligibility and should contact their program with questions.      You will have the opportunity to review your spring semester grades and then choose your grading option for the semester as the deadline for you to choose is not until 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2020.      More details regarding the process through which you will choose your grading options will be communicated by the Office of the University Registrar near the end of the semester.      Satisfactory (S) and No Credit Reported COVID-19 (NCR) grades are not factored into term or cumulative GPA.  To assist graduate students who are graduating this semester and are working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission of your thesis/dissertation has been extended to May 22, 2020.  Please check with your college regarding the college submission deadlines.  While we have structured this new policy to benefit you, I strongly recommend you contact your academic advisor to discuss questions regarding the impact of your grade option choice on academic matters. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid should also be consulted to discuss the impact of your grade option choice on financial aid matters.  The University believes in you and your academic pursuits, and we have made these changes to help you overcome the challenges we face. After reading the policy, should you have questions, please reach out to grading@uh.edu.  Warm regards,\",\n",

       " 'Dear Research Faculty,  We are actively monitoring the local and global health situation around the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. We intend to keep research and research support services functioning as normally as possible, including labs, core facilities and service centers. Funding agencies have not issued any notice affecting proposal submission, awards issuance or other impactful changes to sponsored research activities as it relates to COVID-19.   We understand you may be concerned about possible disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements and want to share current guidance and assure you of our support as the situation develops.   Research-related travel:      The University is restricting all international travel that requires university funds or approval at least until the end of March.     Limit domestic business-related travel at least until the end of March.  Please evaluate your options carefully.     Canceling your travel:         If you have already made and paid for travel arrangements on grant funds, please work with your department’s business staff to request refunds to be credited back to the award. If a refund is not possible and the expenses will remain on the award, you must provide supplemental documentation outlining the refund denial to support the charges.         To date, there is no federal guidance related to charges of cancelled non-refundable travel expenses due to the coronavirus. We will continue to follow the University’s travel expense policy and the Uniform Guidance.  The University’s Travel Information page has been updated to address costs of canceled travel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and concerns.   Funding research staff and students on grants:      Working Remotely  In the event the University of Houston closes/cancels operations due to COVID-19, research staff and students supported on grant funds can be paid provided they remain engaged and continue to work on the project remotely.     If working remotely is not an option, due to the nature of work on the project, the award should not be charged salary. Faculty wishing to retain such staff should work with their Chair and Dean to bridge fund such positions. In the event there is a need to terminate employment you must follow university written policy, which usually requires a 30-day written notice to the employee. If the researcher is unable to continue to work on the project, and is key personnel with committed effort, NIH and NSF policy require notifying the program officer regarding disengagement and effort reductions.     Absence Due to Illness  If a researcher is absent from work due to illness their salary can continue to be paid from the award in accordance with MAPP 02.02.03 Leaves of Absence.  Delays:      Program managers must be informed, in writing, of any delay in the project scope of work caused by disruptive impacts on research progress and compliance with grant requirements. If the delay will result in a late progress report, this information must be conveyed before the report becomes due.     Most federal agencies, including NIH and NSF, do not grant approval for late submissions. Agencies do have policies that address extenuating circumstances. If you have a specific situation that can be considered an extenuating circumstance, please contact the agency Program Official and your UH preaward contact for guidance.  Research awards with human subjects protocols:      The IRB, through the Office of Research Integrity and Oversight, has provided additional guidance for human subjects research.

       " 'Dear Faculty:  We are facing an unprecedented public health situation with the repercussions of the COVID-19 virus and its effect on our communities. Thank you for remaining flexible and accommodating during this time.  In response to the City of Houston and Harris County emergency health declarations, and to do our part in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the University of Houston will immediately cease all face-to-face instructional activities (i.e. lectures, seminars, discussions or presentations) and deliver all of our classes remotely using online and/or virtual learning platforms, at least until April 4.   In order to ensure a smooth transition to online delivery, we have instituted a one week pause in all instructional activities beginning Monday, March 16, including existing online classes. During that week, we must ensure that our students are aware of the implications of this transition and prepared to take classes remotely beginning Monday, March 23.  Monday, March 16 – Saturday, March 21 We ask that you do the following during this week:       Monday, March 16 – Please initiate regular communication with your students through Blackboard or Courseware class shell and via email. Inform your students that there will be a one week pause in all class activities, including all tests, exams, and assignments due during the week of Monday, March 16 through Saturday, March 21. CASA will also be closed March 16 – March 21. A decision will be made at that time regarding CASA’s further operations.         Tuesday, March 17 - Saturday, March 21 – Modify your class curriculum to reflect how you will deliver the remainder of your class content using either asynchronous instruction (i.e. online presentations, discussion boards, reading assignments, etc.) or synchronous instruction (i.e. virtual face-to-face sessions using Blackboard Collaborate, Microsoft Teams, etc.). Ensure that any additional online tools to deliver your class content are enabled and that instructions for their use by students are available within your Blackboard or Courseware class shell. Students must be informed of these curricular changes by posting of your updated curriculum to your class shell no later than noon on Friday, March 20.    Additional information and resources for faculty instructors, including registration details for upcoming online help sessions, quick tutorials, and additional resources for Blackboard and other tools can be found at instruction.uh.edu and uh.edu/fdis.

As we work through these extraordinary circumstances, I know you will work to deliver a high quality education to our students regardless of the format. I deeply appreciate your willingness to work with me as we navigate this situation together.    Warm regards, ',\n",
       " 'March 27, 2020  Dear Cougar Families,  I hope this communication finds your families safe and healthy.  Due to COVID-19 we continue to live and work in uncharted territory. I want you to know that the University of Houston is dedicated to the academic success of our students, as well as to their physical and mental wellbeing.  The University continues to move quickly as events unfold during these uncertain times. This includes actions taken to comply with the Stay Home, Work Safe order issued by Harris County, which includes Houston, on Tuesday, March 24, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. This order is in place through April 3. Measures the University has already taken allow us to easily comply with this order and protect the safety of faculty, staff and students.  A comprehensive list of changes the University has implemented can be found on UH’s COVID-19 website. I encourage you to consult this website regularly for the latest updates. Here, I want to share with you some of these decisions made by University leadership.  Here are some important updates:      As remote online instruction continues, all UH campuses will expand social distancing efforts by reducing or modifying programs and support services. On-campus functions will be limited to supporting essential services;     The M.D. Anderson Library will be closed effective March 25 and until further notice, including computer labs. Students in need of computer access should consult the UH Remote Learning website for resources available;     Student Housing & Residential Life expects to remain open until the end of the Spring semester; however, we are encouraging students who can go home safely to do so until the Stay-at-Home order is lifted;     An interim Undergraduate Grade Policy has been enacted, which will allow undergraduates to choose a letter grade that counts toward their GPA if they received a D- or above, or choose an “S” satisfactory if they passed the class, or take an “NCR” no credit recorded if they did not pass the class. The “S” and “NCR” will not impact their GPA. Students may make different grade choices for different classes.  The Division of Student Affairs and Enrollment Services will continue to serve students remotely, via phone, email or online chats. Many services now offer virtual options, including live chats for career counseling, teletherapy sessions from Counseling and Psychological Services, telehealth from the Student Health Center and online workouts from Campus Recreation.  We have posted a summary of how to access services on our website.  Although this is a challenging time, I am confident that the Cougar Nation will persevere. The University of Houston’s faculty and staff remain committed to ensuring student success despite the circumstances.  Please take care of yourself and your families.  Sincerely, Richard Walker, Ed.D. Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Services (713) 743-5390 uhdsaes@uh.edu',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,  I hope you and your families are safe and well, and secluded like I have been. As a sign of the times, my family came together virtually to celebrate our granddaughter’s 7th birthday. We didn’t get any cake, but we’re doing our part to keep this virus from spreading and not contribute to the dangerous workload of our heroic healthcare workers.  Looking forward to the summer, not even our most knowledgeable health experts can predict with certainty when the threat of COVID-19 will subside. But we do know it will be with us for some time and so will the need for social distancing. That is why my leadership team and I have made the decision to continue delivering remote instruction for all four summer sessions, which begin June 1, and the May mini-session.  Even with classes online, we still have about 1,600 students living in on-campus housing and dedicated staff who are preparing food, cleaning and sanitizing our buildings for those who must access their office or lab, and police and security officers on their regular patrols. Even though we are enforcing social distancing and following all guidance from health officials, it is not lost on me the anxiety that is felt by those people whose presence at the workplace is essential to support delivery of education. I truly appreciate you all.  Finally, I want to recognize our faculty who have adjusted to holding class online and our researchers who are testing potential drugs to fight COVID-19 and applying technology to protect health care workers on the frontlines. Where we can, the University of Houston is also providing much-needed resources to people on the frontline in the greater Houston area.  It’s a reminder that treating patients and stopping the spread of COVID-19 indeed takes all of us. Together we will get through this.  With warm regards, Renu Khator',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty:   First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. These are unprecedented times and the many professional and personal challenges we all currently face are trying and difficult. In the midst of the truly universal impact of COVID-19 on our campus community, our nation, and the world, I am deeply impressed with how each of you has faced the many challenges of rapidly transitioning to online teaching while showing an extraordinary level of commitment to your students. In one week, you transitioned over 6,500 course sections to an online format while simultaneously learning to use a range of new tools and processes. Each day brings new challenges, and each day you continue to rise to meet them. I am grateful for your tenacity and resilience, without which I know it would be impossible to continue our primary mission: educating our students.   The current circumstances have required us all to make many changes in the way we work, teach, and advance our research. Thus, I want to ensure that the Office of the Provost continues to provide the help and support you need as a faculty member to remain up-to-date on policy changes and new opportunities for assistance and resources. Going forward, I will be sending regular newsletters to you that include information on topics in which the faculty has expressed an interest, including web links to policy updates and FAQs, specific dates and times for virtual office hours with my senior staff, and announcements of online opportunities for self-care through the FED and the ADVANCE Center.   Over the past two weeks, through our shared governance process, and in close collaboration with the Faculty Senate, we have implemented a range of policy changes to lessen the frustration and concern of both our students and our faculty in these challenging times. In this newsletter, I want to focus on those policy changes and announce dates and times for virtual office hours to afford you the opportunity to have your specific questions addressed personally.     university Divider  Undergraduate Students   As our students may be facing a number of challenges associated with our transition to online classes, it is critically important that we identify and engage with those students who have not yet responded, or otherwise made contact, since we began our remote instruction on March 23. With that in mind, you will be receiving a follow-up email with instructions on how to respond to a Navigate Progress Report Campaign toward the goal of successful course completion.   We have instituted an interim grade policy for undergraduate students. The graphic below was shared with undergraduate students following the announcement of the change to help them make the best academic decision at the end of the semester.  Graduate and Professional Students   A similar interim grade policy is in effect for graduate and professional students. In addition, to assist students who are graduating this semester and are currently working to complete their thesis or dissertation, the deadline for final submission has been extended to May 22, 2020.  On March 18, deans and department chairs received an email providing initial guidance concerning the process for requesting an extension of the probationary period due to the current situation. Guidelines on extension of the probationary period due the impact of COVID-19 will apply to both tenure track (TT) and promotion-eligible non tenure track (NTT) faculty members.   Faculty members may request an extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure under existing provisions in the current P&T and NTT policies for “Extension of the Probationary Period for Emergencies.” Extension requests related to the negative impact of COVID-19 on their timely progression toward promotion and/or tenure may be made by a faculty member at any time during their probationary period up until March 1 of the year in which the mandatory review is scheduled. For those faculty members currently scheduled for mandatory review beginning in fall 2020, the March 1, 2020 deadline for the Provost to review such requests has been extended until May 31, 2020. Current policy allows up to two, one-year extensions of the probationary period for birth or adoption of a child. Faculty members who have already received two previous extensions for birth or adoption of a child may request an additional extension based on the negative impact of the current COVID-19 situation on their timely progress toward promotion and/or tenure.  Forthcoming annual updates to the P&T and NTT policies for the 2020-2021 review cycle will be issued by May 1 and explicitly reflect the above accommodations.   Student Course Evaluation Committee   I have appointed a committee charged with developing an interim policy on student course evaluations. Faculty Senate President Jeronimo Cortina is serving as the chair. The committee is developing an interim policy which acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on faculty instruction and educational practice. It will provide recommendations to me on the most appropriate role student course evaluations should play in assessing student learning and faculty instructional effectiveness during the disruption caused by COVID-19. The interim policy will be implemented within the next two weeks and will apply to all classes taught during the spring and summer 2020 semesters.  The current membership of the committee is: Dr. Vallabh Das (Faculty Senate President-Elect), Dr. Susie Gronseth (Faculty Senate Secretary, EDU), Dr. Jason Draper (Faculty Affairs Committee, HRM), Dr. David Shattuck (Undergraduate Committee, ENG), Dr. Rheeda Walker (CLASS/PSYCH), and Ms. Nia Soherta (MEC, Office of the Provost).  Below are several dates for Virtual Office Hours to answer any specific questions you may have on the topics covered in this email. A link to join these virtual sessions can be found on the Office of the Provost COVID-19 Resource webpage.       Requesting an Extension to Probationary Period: April 9, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m. (TEAMS), and April 10, 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. (ZOOM)      Interim Student Course Evaluation Policy: April 9, 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. (ZOOM), and April 10, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m. (TEAMS)     Interim Undergraduate Student Grade Policy: April 9, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. (TEAMS), and April 10, 11 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. (ZOOM)     Interim Graduate and Professional Student Grade Policy: April 9, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. (ZOOM), and April 10, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m. (TEAMS)  Most importantly, I want to be certain that you continue to access all the resources our University offers to ensure your emotional and physical well-being during this crisis. Our commitment to the University of Houston to enhance human knowledge, to discover new solutions to our world’s challenges, to be relevant to our city and our communities, and to ensure the success of our students, will outlast our current situation.  Thank you for your continued patience and leadership. Please reach out to me at provost@uh.edu for additional support, questions, or suggestions. Please continue to stay safe and healthy.  Kindest regards,',\n",
       " 'Dear Students:   Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we have all experienced an extraordinary, sudden shift in how our university delivers and receives academic instruction. This was not easy for anyone involved, but necessary for the University of Houston to fulfill our responsibility to deliver a Tier One education, regardless of the circumstances.  Recognizing that all of you are juggling this change with uncertainty in your personal lives, the University is providing assistance to help overcome short-term resource and financial obstacles and ensure you can continue your studies.  Summer School Changes Registration for summer school is now open and I encourage you to consider enrolling in one or more of the classes being offered online. The University is making additional changes that benefit you:      The interim grading policies for both undergraduate and graduate students have been extended to include all summer 2020 sessions.  Additionally, the University is waiving fees for the summer sessions as follows:      For students taking six credit hours or more during summer 2020, all mandatory fees will be waived;     For students taking less than six credit hours during summer 2020, all mandatory fees except extended access fees will be waived.  Computer Loaner Program If you have not been able to access your course materials because you do not have a computer to use while you are learning remotely, we have a limited number of computers available to check out to complete coursework for the duration of the spring semester. The University began reaching out to students last week who have not accessed course materials, starting with seniors. Students who need access to a loaner or who need other assistance with technological needs related to their classes may contact the UH IT Help Desk at 713.743.1411 (call or text), or email support@uh.edu.  There is no question these are stressful times for everyone. No matter the challenges we are all facing, our priorities are to ensure your health and wellbeing and that your education continues without interruption. I urge you to consult the University’s COVID-19 website for additional resources, including access to Counseling and Psychological Services and answers to many frequently asked questions.  Warm regards, ',\n",
       " 'Dear Faculty and Staff,  We are deeply thankful and proud of the way each of you has responded to our rapid shift in operations, while juggling your own personal challenges, to meet our vital mission of teaching, research and service. These are far from normal times, and your dedication is nothing short of amazing.  The short-term and long-term financial prognoses for the economy – and specifically higher education – are challenging due to the events surrounding COVID-19.  We are now experiencing declines in many essential sources of revenue, which is coupled with an increased need for student financial aid and uncertainty about future enrollment.  While the University has taken a number of steps to immediately reduce expenses and prepare for future financial uncertainty, we must also keep in mind our fiscal responsibilities. Thus the current 30-day pause on new financial obligations, scheduled to expire on April 19, will be extended to Aug. 31, the end of our fiscal year, or until further notice.  Specifically, this includes the following guidelines: Human Resources  HR activities including the hiring, promotion, reclassification, or position funding changes – and all salary adjustments using central and auxiliary funds, or more specifically state, tuition, course fees, indirect costs, campus auxiliary fees, student service fees, athletics and other local revenue – are suspended.  Transactions including any combination of centrally allocated funds and other non-centrally allocated funds are not exempt from this suspension.    Exceptions will exist on all funds on a case-by-case basis to facilitate the hiring of faculty reappointments, including adjunct faculty and graduate students who will continue to teach classes already scheduled for the summer.  Similarly, activities on positions using gift funds, federal grants, research grants or sponsored projects may continue. Procurement  To help us conserve our current financial resources and slow the rate of spending through the end of the fiscal year, all contracts, procurements, and purchases by any method, including procurement cards and travel cards that utilize central funding and auxiliary sources, are suspended.  Exceptions to these guidelines for Human Resources activities and Procurement will continue to require approval of the Division VP, the Provost, and the SVP for Administration and Finance.  We recognize these guidelines are difficult and will touch every aspect of the University, including academics, administration, operations and support services, and athletics, but we strongly believe the continuation of these actions is a prudent move given the fiscal uncertainty of our situation.  We appreciate your continued understanding and support.

       " 'Dear Colleagues,  I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. We have come to the end of this very unusual spring semester. Thanks to your efforts, which included transitioning thousands of classes and services online, more than 6,000 students will graduate next week.  Congratulations … to all of us!  Here are some important updates for you.  Reopening the University: Earlier this week, Gov. Abbott announced a plan to safely reopen Texas.  I had already appointed a UH System Reopening Task Force under the co-chairmanship of Vice Chancellor Amr Elnashai and UHV President Robert Glenn.  The task force approved seven guiding principles and nine questions to be answered before reopening the system universities. In consultation with the task force, we are reopening the University in four phases: (1) research operations (2) low-touch, low-risk administrative operations (3) all operations and athletics, and finally (4) classroom instruction.  On Tuesday, May 5, research labs at UH can be opened by those researchers who wish to do so. This is voluntary, not mandatory.  Certain administrative services necessary to assist the researchers will also open. The Division of Research will soon send out an email with details.  A few measures have been taken to ensure a safe working environment as we reopen that include:      Anyone working in a lab will be required to complete a training module, pass a self-health screening test and is expected to cooperate with contact tracing. The training and screening can be found on AccessUH beginning Friday, May 1.     All CDC and state rules of social distancing will be followed, including the use of face masks if anyone is working in close proximity of others (within 6 feet).     UH Facilities will adhere to strict rules to clean and disinfect common spaces and arrangements must be made to clean and disinfect lab areas per CDC guidelines.     Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 or suffering from any respiratory illness will not be allowed in labs.     Lab personnel will follow proper UH protocol if a positive COVID-19 case is identified in a lab.     We are closely monitoring public health conditions in the state and the city and will provide further instructions for the next phase based on future developments. Until then, all faculty and staff –with the exception of those who choose to open their labs or are classified as essential support personnel – will continue to work from home.  Summer semester: All summer sessions will be taught online. In view of financial difficulties faced by students, the Board of Regents  has waived some fees for summer enrollees, saving many more than $300 per student. At this point, our summer enrollment looks very strong and we hope to continue the trend.  Fall semester: We expect to resume face-to-face instruction in the fall.  However, we are making plans for three scenarios: fully online, fully on campus, and some form of hybrid. Depending on the public health conditions in the city, we will make that determination sometime in late May or early June.  Commencement: Knowing that our students want to walk across the stage, we have postponed May’s commencement exercise until fall. However, several colleges are hosting virtual memory-sharing events, and we will also do something symbolic to recognize this very important milestone in our graduates’ life.  Emergency aid to students: The CARES ACT included $18 million in direct emergency aid to UH students.  From these funds, we are able to provide support to more than 26,000 students. While we are grateful for these funds, we know that the need is far greater than the allotted funds.  The Cougar Emergency Fund, which is supported by donations, will offer additional assistance to students in need. Finding another way to help, our IT department secured 300 loaner computers for students who were without that vital educational tool.  University Budget: Our fiscal year ends at the end of August, so it is difficult to predict the exact loss of revenue for the University.  The final number will depend upon three factors: state budget reduction, summer and fall enrollment, and available federal or state stimulus funds. Looking at the impact of COVID 19 on the overall economy and the declining state resources because of the oil crisis, it’s logical to assume that our budget will be stressed. I have appointed a Financial Task Force under the chairmanship of Provost Paula Short and Senior Vice President Jim McShan to review all financial tools at our disposal. We are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best and always keeping the well-being of our Cougar family in mind.  Thank you, once again, for your dedicated service.  If you have any questions, you can direct them to the chairs of the Financial Task Force or send them to COVID-19 email (coronavirus@uh.edu) or check the COVID-19 website for updates and new information.  Please stay safe and healthy!  With warm regards, Renu Khator']"
